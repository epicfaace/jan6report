Dear General Walker, Muriel Bowser 
Dr. Christopher Rodriguez 
As you know, l=irst Amendment demonstrations permitted by the National Park Service are 
scheduled to occur in the District of Columbia on Tuesday, January 5, 2021 and Wednesday, January 
6, 2021. As a result, District Government requests DC National Guard (DCNG) support, as these 
demonstrations will follow similar events on November 14, 2020 and December 12, 2020, which 
resulted in a large influx of participants, violence, and criminal activity. I can confirm that the 
requesting DC agencies below have exhausted their organic capabilities in accordance with the 
Seven Step Call-Up process for DCNG support. This request is made on behalf of, and with 
concurrence from, The l-lonorable Muriel Bowser, Mayor of Washington, DC. 
l=irst, to support the Metropolitan Police Department's (MPD) security mission, it is requested that 
members of DCNG be activated to assist MPD. Due to the size of these events, all available MPD 
resources will be deployed and the assistance of DCNG will be essential in supporting the security 
plan. The mission of DCNG during this activation will primarily be crowd management and assistance 
with blocking vehicles at traffic posts. Specifically, DCNG is requested to provide: 
• Six (6) crowd management teams to manage crowds at specified Metro stations and prevent 
overcrowding on Metro platforms; 
• A team to assist at thirty (30) designated traffic posts. 
DCNG should be prepared to staff these locations from 0730 hours until 2400 hours on both 
Tuesday, January 5, 2021 and Wednesday, January 6, 2021. In addition, it is requested that DCNG 
members be equipped with visibility vests and lighted traffic wands to assist with this mission. The 
availability of resources to assist MPD would greatly enhance our ability to successfully accomplish 
our mission of securing the safety of the residents and visitors of the District of Columbia.
