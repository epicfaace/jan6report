Joint Session of Congress -Electoral College Vote Certification 
Bottom Line Up Front: 
• On Wednesday, January 6, 2021, the 117th United States Congress will gather for a joint 
session in the chamber of the House of Representatives to certify the counting of the electoral 
votes. 
• There are some representatives who plan to challenge the votes during this session. However, 
the challenge will only move forward if a Republican senator agrees to cosign such objection _i 
• The Intelligence and lnteragency Coordination Division is currently tracking several protests 
slated to take place on Capitol grounds on January 6, 2021, and some protesters have indicated 
they plan to be armed. 
Event Summary: 
On Wednesday, January 6, 2021, the 117th United States Congress will gather for a joint session in the 
chamber of the House of Representatives to certify the counting of the electoral votes. The President of 
the Senate, Vice President of the United States (VPOTUS) Michael Pence, is the presiding officer. If a 
senator and a representative jointly submit an objection, each would retire to its chamber to consider it. 
The President and Vice President must achieve a majority of electoral votes (i.e., at least 270 votes) to 
be elected. In the absence of a majority, the House selects the President, and the Senate selects the 
Vice President. ii If neither candidate achieves the required 270 vote minimum, the House then decides 
the election in accordance with the 12th Amendment of the Constitution. Each state would get one vote 
with a minimum of 26 votes deciding the winner. 
• Analyst Comment: Representative Mo Brooks (R-AL) along with Representative Elect Barry 
Moore (R-AL.)/i iv v and Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) plan to challenge the 
Electoral College votes when Congress officially certifies Joe Biden's victory on January 6, 
2021, as long as a Senate Republican joins them in the long-shot effort. vi vii Along with this trio 
of Representatives, Representative Jim Jordan (R-OHY;;;, Representative Matt Gaetz (R-FLyx 
and Representative Louie Gohmert (R-TX) may also support an objection to the results on the

House floor. x Recently elected Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) has indicated he will join the 
objection of the representatives in electoral vote.xi At the time of this report, Senator Rand Paul 
(R-KY) and Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI) have also not ruled out filing an objection to the 
electoral votes,-Xii however, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has warned the 
Senate of taking such an action_xm 
It should be noted that all 538 electors met Monday, December 14, 2020, in their respective 
states to cast their votes for president based on the election results that were certified by all 50 
states and Washington, D. C. xiv 
On Tuesday, December 15, 2020, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) officially 
recognized Joseph Biden as the President-Elect, the day after the Electoral College certified the 
votes_xv 
Expected Protests Overview: 
A number of individuals and groups are calling for their supporters to travel to Washington, DC, on or 
before January 6, 2021, to show support for POTUS and for overturning the election results. The 
demonstrations/rallies are expected to be similar to the previous Million MAGA March rallies in 
November and December 2020, which drew tens of thousands of participants. It is also expected that 
members of the Proud Boys, Antifa, and other extremist groups will rally on January 6, 2021. Multiple 
arrests were made as a result of clashes between pro-Trump and opposing groups during each of the 
November and December rallies. Charges included assault with a dangerous weapon, assault on 
police, simple assault, weapons violations, riotous acts, destruction of property, disorderly conduct, 
resisting arrest, and crossing a police line. A number of law enforcement officers were injured in the 
skirmishes. Many of the confrontations occurred after the rallies ended. 
Pro-Trump Protests: 
Women for America First (WAF) is organizing another bus tour beginning on December 27, 2020, in 
Ventura, CA, and arriving in Washington, DC, on January 6, 2021, for a rallyxvi_ A banner on the 
webpage states, "The President is calling for us to come back to Washington on January 6th for a big 
protest -'Be There, Will Be Wild."' The time and location will be announced at a later date. WAF filed 
a permit with the U.S. Park Service for 5,000 participants for January 6, 2021. and with the Metropolitan 
Police Department (MPD) for 50 participants to assemble at Freedom Plaza and then proceed to the 
U.S. Capitol. The USCP Special Event Section (SES) advised that WAF filed for Union Square (Area 
15) also for 50 participants. 
Stop the Steal has posted a webpage entitled "wild protest.com" that includes a map of the Capitol 
grounds indicating they will be gathering on the Senate East Front Grassy Area 9 on January 6, 2021. 
The webpage states "We the People must take to the U.S. Capitol lawn and steps ... " They plan to 
show support for Rep. Mo Brooks and several other Members of Congress who are expected to file 
objections to the certification of the electoral vote. They list the following speakers as confirmed to 
participate in this event:

increase in the number of bookings on/around January 6, 2021.

ridesharing to Washington, DC, for the January 6, 2021 demonstrations/rallies. They are also 
organizing protests at state capitals and city halls. As of December 22, 2020, there are over 100 posts

being widely shared on social media. 
There are also several other permit requests pending with the USCP for this day. SES advised a 
number of people contacted them regarding filing permits for January 6, 2021, for Capitol Grounds. 
Bryan Lewis filed for the Senate East Front Grassy Area 9 for 50 participants and Women For a Great

Analyst Comment: The previously reported Patriots United March for Congress has been 
deleted and the Patriots United website no longer contains any information about this event; 
therefore, this event has been removed from the list of protests scheduled for January 6, 2021.

Finally, there have been several social media posts encouraging protesters to be armed.xviii Sam 
Andrews from the Freedom Center USA recently appeared on The Hagmann Report podcast calling for 
armed individuals to assemble in Washington, DC, beginning on January 4, 2021, to demand answers 
on election fraud. He advised listeners to travel in large, armed groups to discourage law enforcement 
action against armed individuals. When asked by the moderator if Andrews was organizing this event, 
Andrews replied he is not organizing anything and is just encouraging "concerned Americans to travel 
to DC" to exercise their first and second amendment rights. Andrews goes on to say if 500,000 armed 
citizens are in Washington, the police would "have a whole different attitude" and would not be able to 
attack the armed citizens.xix 
Expected Protests (Pro-Biden): 
The They/Them Collective posted to their lnstagram account a messagexx about the MAGA rallies in 
January. No specific details were published at this time about a protest location or time. Shutdown DC 
also posted to social media about the MAGA rallies on January 6, 2021, asking for donations "to help 
us defend democracy."xxi Refuse Fascism is also promoting a protest on this same day_xxii While the 
groups have not indicated where they intend to gather, in the past they have demonstrated in the BLM 
Plaza area. 
The group "I Approve this Message" is also planning a march entitled "Donald, You're Fired! March on 
DC" for January 6, 2021 _xxiii They have indicated they would gather in the Union Square area, 
however, as of the date of this publication, they have not requested a permit for that area. Interest is 
also relatively low based on the Facebook post.

IICD Overall Analysis: 
IICD has found no information regarding specific disruptions or acts of civil disobedience targeting this 
function. Due to the tense political environment following the 2020 election, the threat of disruptive 
actions or violence cannot be ruled out. Actions of individuals or small groups are generally not 
broadcast publically making them impossible to detect.
