2 All right. This is the transcribed interview of Alex 
3 Cannon, conducted by the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack 
4 on the United States Capitol, pursuant to House Resolution 503. 
5 At this time, I'm going to ask the witness to please state your full name for the 
6 record. 
Mr. Cannon. Alexander Wells Cannon. 7 
8 And, Mr. Cannon, this will be a staff-led interview, though 
9 Members may choose to ask questions. At this time, I do not see any members present. 
10 My name is I'm an investigative counsel with the 
11 select committee. With me from the select committee is to my left, 
12 senior investigative counsel; to my right, , financial investigator; and 
13 we are joined by-via the Webex who is senior counsel to the vice chair. 
14 At this time, I'd ask your counsel to identify himself for the record and any lawyers 
15 with you, Mr. Benson. 
16 Mr. Benson. Daniel Benson, Kasowitz Benson Torres, representing Mr. Cannon, 
17 and joining me is Jonathan Gonzales of our firm and Jacob Benson of our firm. 
18 All right. Now, Mr. Cannon, you are voluntarily here for 
19 this transcribed interview. The ground rules for this interview are, first, there's an 
20 official reporter transcribing the record of this interview. The reporter transcription will 
21 be official record. 
22 The proceeding is also audio and video recorded, and we ask that you do not 
23 audio or video record the proceeding. 
24 Please wait until each question is complete before you begin to response, and 
25 we'll do our best to wait until your response is complete before we ask the next question.  4 
1 The reporter cannot note nonverbal responses, such as shaking or nodding your 
2 head. So it's important that you respond to each question with an audible, verbal 
3 response. 
4 Please give complete answers to the best of your recollection, and if the answer is 
5 unclear, please ask for clarification. If you don't know an answer, please just say so. 
6 We're happy to take any breaks for you, whether comfort breaks, to speak with 
7 your attorney at any time. Just let us know, we're happy to accommodate. 
8

11 
12 
13 Now before we begin, do you have any questions? 
Mr. Cannon. No, sir, I don't. Thank you. 
All right. 
EXAMINATION 
BY 
Q All right. Mr. Cannon, seeing that we had a prior transcribed interview with 
14 you, we're not going to go over some of the biographical and educational information 
15 that you stated the first time we met with you. 
16 In preparation for this interview, did you collect documents that were responsive 
17 to our request? 
18 
19 
20 A 
Q 
A Yes, sir. 
Can you describe that process for us? 
I contacted our e-discovery vendor, asked them to bring down data that 
21 would've been responsive to the request. I reviewed the data and produced the data 
22 that was responsive to your request. 
23 
24 
25 Q 
A 
Q And who is that e-discovery vendor? 
That's 2M Document Management --Imaging and Management. 
Yeah. Going forward, we'll just refer to them as 2M. Is that okay with  1 you? 
2 Yes, sir. 5 
3 A 
Q And we see from --and without getting into conversations you had with your 
4 lawyer, in the documents you produced, there are a variety of redactions in those 
5 documents. Did you review all those redactions before the production was made to us? 
6 A Yes, sir. 
7 Q Okay. So it's fair to say that, to the best of your ability, you believe all 
8 those redactions and the related substance as indicated on the face of redactions are 
9 accurate? 
10 
11 A 
Q Yes, I do, yes, sir. 
All right. So today, Mr. Cannon, we're going to speak a bit about --just 
12 giving you a roadmap, because we're going to try to make this a pretty relatively quick 
13 interview and try to be precise with our questioning and kind of get to the point. 
14 We're going to talk a bit about how the recount expense process worked both 
15 after the election and also how that's worked since the end of the Trump administration. 
16 So, starting on that first question, take us to post-election day. There's now 
17 fundraising for elections. What's the process by which expenditures are approved by 
18 the campaign? 
19 A Are you talking about any expenditure? I mean, it's --there's a lot of 
20 expenditures that happen. 
21 
22 Q 
A To be specific, the recount expenses. 
So what date --where are we right now in time? I mean, obviously the 
23 recount account and recount fund was used for a number of purposes. But I want to 
24 make sure that I'm being responsive to your question. 
25 Q No, I appreciate that. So we're talking post-election. So let's  6 
1 actually --I'm going to show you an exhibit that may help frame some of this, about what 
2 we're talking about. It's an exhibit that will be up in a minute. 
3 It's an email from you --that comes to you from an individual named Stewart 
4 Crosland. Can you tell us who that is? 
5 
6 A 
Q Yeah. Stewart Crosland is outside counsel at Jones Day. 
And am I right that Mr. Crosland and Jones Day handled the campaign's 
7 efficacy compliance issues? 
8 
9 A 
Q That is correct. 
Okay. So here's an email that's been marked exhibit 1. It's a November 
10 9th email from Mr. Crosland from Jones Day, providing disclaimer language. And, if we 
11 scroll to the bottom there, you see that Mr. Crosland --
12 A Sorry, just one moment. It's very small on my screen. 
13 I have to --
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 Q 
A 
Q Okay. Is that --maybe we can zoom in. 
No, it was me. It was how I had it laid out. We're fine now. 
Oh, I'm sorry. Okay. 
All right. Is that better now for you? 
A Yes, sir. 
Q Okay. So here you see it's a November 9th email from Mr. Crosland to you 
20 and copying Sean Doi Iman, and it says: This is what a split page would need. 
21 It then has a disclaimer that would go at the bottom of a fund raising email. Does 
22 that seem familiar to you? 
23 
24 A 
Q Yeah, it does. It looks like it's from my production, so, yes. 
Yes. And then you see, in the second paragraph there, it says: Your 
25 contribution to DJTFP will be allocated to DJTFP's recount account up to the maximum of  7 
1 $2,800 per individual. Donations to DJTFP's recount account will be used solely in 
2 connection with any post-election recounts and election contests and not for the purpose 
3 of influencing any Federal election. 
4 Have you seen that disclaimer before? 
5 
6 A 
Q Yes, sir. 
Okay. So here it references a campaign recount account. What did you 
7 understand that recount account to be? 
8 A So I think I previously gave some testimony on this subject, but after election 
9 day, when polls close, a campaign can raise money and make expenditures for two 
10 purposes. The first is debt retirement, and the second one is recount. 
11 Q And, as far as the latter, the recount option, did the campaign set up a 
12 segregated account to handle those recount-related donations? 
13 A I believe so, but I --I don't know all of the different accounts that the 
14 campaign has, but I believe that they would've done that, yes. 
15 Q All right. And the campaign would've done that to be in compliance with 
16 FEC rules. Is that correct? 
17 A I don't know if it's required to be in compliance, but my guess is that that --I 
18 can't answer that question, whether or not there's a specific rule that requires it, sitting 
19 here today. 
20 Q And who would be the person at the campaign who would be tasked with 
21 knowing that? 
22 A With knowing? I mean, we would've taken advice from Jones Day. It 
23 would've been, you know, the treasury team and Sean Dallman. 
24 Q And who would know from the campaign whether a segregated account 
25 was, in fact, created?  8 
I mean, Dallman, Mr. Dallman. 1 
2 A 
Q So your understanding was, as you just said, that when the funds --after the 
3 debt retirement, any funds the campaign itself was raising would've been for the purpose 
4 of post-election recounts and otherwise challenging the election. Is that fair? 
5 
6 
7 A 
Q 
A I mean, that is --that is certainly one use of the funds. 
Is there another use that you're aware of? 
Well, I mean, I'll tell you that any expenditures that have been made out of 
8 recount were made consistent with advice from outside counsel. And I'm not going to 
9 get into the substance of, you know, privileged conversations, but outside counsel did 
10 provide advice with respect to what can and cannot be paid out of recount, and we 
11 followed that advice. 
12 Q And I appreciate that, and we're not looking to get into your communication 
13 with outside counsel, but we are looking to get a sense of your understanding as to what 
14 these funds could and could not be used for. 
15 A Well, my understanding is that, like it says in the disclaimer here, it can't be 
16 used --one of the things it cannot be used for is to influence an election. So it cannot be 
17 used for electioneering purposes --
18 
19 
20 Q 
A 
Q And is it fair to say --
--the specific definition under FECA. 
And, consistent with this disclaimer that you received from outside counsel, 
21 was it also your understanding that it could be used solely in connection with any 
22 post-election recounts and election contests? 
23 A No, sir, that is not correct. That is not consistent with the advice we got 
24 from outside counsel. 
25 Q So are you saying that the advice you got from outside counsel is not what is  1 in this disclaimer provided by outside counsel? 
2 A Well, I mean, I'm not --I'm saying that there are categories here of 
3 information --look, this is the disclaimer that they provided to us. We got subsequent 
4 advice from outside counsel about how we could use recount funds, and we used the 
5 funds in accordance with that advice from outside counsel. 
6 I'm not going to weigh in and provide advice on what's, you know, how I interpret 
7 this disclaimer. You guys can interpret the disclaimer. 
8 Q Okay. Now, so, Mr. Cannon, I want to be clear. Is it --when you got this 
9 disclaimer sent to you November 9th of 2020, it was your understanding that this 
10 disclaimer would be what's going out to potential donors of the campaign, correct? 
11 
12 A 
Q That is correct. 
And when individuals made donations, post-election, to the campaign, they 
13 were being told what their money would and would not be used for. Is that correct? 
14 
15 A 
Q That is correct. 
And when the disclaimer in the second paragraph says it would be used 
16 solely in connection with any post-election recount and election contest, that was telling 
17 donors what their money would be used solely for, is that fair, at that time? 
A I suppose --I mean, I suppose so. 9 
18 
19 Mr. Benson. Excuse me. I think the language speaks for itself, and, you know, I 
20 think it was --I think that it was provided by the same counsel that provided the later 
21 advice with respect to the use of the funds. 
22 No, I appreciate that, •. 
23 
24 Q But if we scroll up here, Mr. Cannon, you forward this language on to Darren 
25 Centinello further up, correct?  I --I mean, I can't see. 
Yeah. So you forward it to Mr. Centinello, right? 
Okay. 
I'm saying --asking, do you see that? 
I see that, yes, sir. 10 
1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q And then Mr. Centinello, who has a datapier address, then responds: And 
7 which disclaimer goes on the email? 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 And says: Standard DJTFP. 
And then you respond: Both DJTFP and Save America. 
A 
Q 
A Okay. 
Correct? 
Yes. 
13 Q So is it fair to say that when you forwarded this on to Mr. Centinello, you had 
14 an understanding as to what that disclaimer meant, the import of it? Is that fair? 
15 A Yeah. I knew it had to go at the bottom. I knew, after election day, we 
16 had to change the disclaimer. That's what Jones Day was telling us. 
17 
18 Q BY-: 
Can I ask a, I guess, a mechanical question? And apologies if this doesn't 
19 make sense because it is very campaign-finance related. But how can you put two 
20 disclaimers at the bottom of an email? Are they --if they're different? Or do they 
21 have to be consistent? 
22 A I mean, are there two disclaimers at the bottom of any emails that you've 
23 seen? 
24 Q No. I'm trying to figure out what you mean when you say "both DJTFP and 
25 Save America." Because he says, "which disclaimer goes on the emails, standard DJTFP,"  11 
1 and you say: Both DJTFP and Save America. 
2 A I'm not sure, sitting here right now, what I meant by that. I mean, I think 
3 what I was getting at was that these are the disclaimers that are to be used on both DJTFP 
4 and Save America. But I mean, it's --we're talking, I mean, this has been almost 2 years 
5 now. 
6 Q Yeah, no, I understand that. I guess, if it was specific to that instance, I was 
7 just curious if it meant the ones that included donations to both entities or if you actually 
8 meant emails both from --I was just trying to figure out what you meant there, what the 
9 both was in reference to. 
10 
11 now --
12 
13 
14 
15 A 
Q 
A 
Q I probably could've answered that question 2 years ago. I don't know right 
Okay. 
--sitting here, what I meant. 
BY 
All right, Mr. Cannon, I want to show you another email that we've marked 
16 as exhibit 2, which is --we talked about this email previously in your first transcribed 
17 interview. And I'm going to start with your --on the second page of this email. Excuse 
18 me. 
19 So it's 2 days later from the email we just discussed. It's November 11th, and 
20 Cleta Mitchell, a lawyer with Foley Lardner at that time, sends you an email that says: Is 
21 there a legal defense fund set up just for Trump campaign, or is that part of the JFC with 
22 RNC? 
23 Do you see that? 
24 
25 A 
Q Yes, I do. 
And then you respond: The campaign has a recount fund, and RNC has a  1 legal proceedings fund. There is fundraising occurring through the JFA. In addition, 
2 POTUS established a leadership PAC on Monday night that has been added to the JFA. 
3 Do you see that, sir? 
Yes, I do. 
And that leadership PAC is Save America, correct? 
Yes, sir. I believe so. 12 
4 
5 
6 
7 A 
Q 
A 
Q All right. If we scroll up further, Ms. Mitchell asks you questions about how 
8 they can help, how she can help with money being raised. 
9 We'll scroll up further, and then you provide some clarification, and you say: 
10 There is no specific name for the recount fund. It's just a segregated, restricted account 
11 held --it says "help," but I think you meant held --by the campaign. Not sure what Dan 
12 Coates has to do with anything. 
13 So here --does this refresh your recollection that you were aware that the 
14 campaign had a segregated restricted account to which it raised recount funds? 
15 
16 
17 A 
Q 
A It appears that at that time that was my understanding. 
Okay. And you would've gotten that understanding from who? 
I mean, probably from someone on the treasury team. I mean, it would've 
18 been, you know, either Sean, or it would've been Stewart Crosland, I mean, any number 
19 of people. 
20 BY 
21 
22 Q 
A Crosland was the attorney, or he was on the treasury team? 
No. Stewart Crosland is the partner at Jones Day who worked under 
23 Ben Ginsberg, who was providing outside counsel. 
24 
25 Q 
A He could've told you about the fund that was created? 
Well, yeah, because he would've been the one who advised the campaign  13 
1 whether or not we had to have a restricted --a segregated account or a non-segregated 
2 account. 
3 Q Oh, I think we should be more particular. I think my colleague was asking 
4 who would've actually told you that the account had been set up. So we want to be 
5 careful --
6 A We knew --sorry. We knew --I'm sorry. You can finish your question, 
7 -
8 Q No. I just want to --we want to be very careful because there is this issue 
9 with your counsel, and we don't want to ask you about communications with counsel. 
10 So, understanding that counsel may have said you need to set up a fund, the 
11 question of, but who would've told you that the fund had actually been created, it 
12 sounded like that would've been more Mr. Doi Iman or somebody who would've actually 
13 been responsible for setting up the fund. Is that fair? 
14 A Yeah, that's fair. I mean, they would've had to, in order to raise money into 
15 it. I mean, it would've --through the WinRed process and everything, it would have to 
16 be set up. It would have to be aimed at an account. Right? 
17 Q Right. And so I think that's what we were asking, is, you say it's a 
18 segregated, restricted account, which presumably you may have gotten legal advice to 
19 create, but who would've actually created such that money could go in, that would've 
20 been Mr. Doi Iman or somebody on the actual treasury team. That's what we were 
21 trying to confirm. 
22 A Yeah, I believe that's correct. Yeah, I don't know who else would've been 
23 setting up accounts. 
24 
25 Q Okay. 
BY  14 
1 Q Now, Mr. Cannon, here in this email where you talk about the fundraising 
2 through the joint fundraising agreement, you're talking about what's referred to as 
3 TMAGAC, correct? 
4 A Yeah. I think that was the only joint fund raising committee at that time. 
Yeah. 5 
6 Q 
A There might've still been Trump Victory, but I don't think that we were doing 
7 small dollar fund raising through Trump Victory. 
8 Q And that's my understanding as well from our investigation. 
9 So is it then fair to say that the fundraising that's occurring around this time, 
10 November 11th, that's going through TMAGAC, the funds that were being raised for the 
11 purpose of campaign would've been going to this recount fund, this segregated account? 
12 A I don't know the split, though, because the RNC was a part of that, of 
13 TMAGAC, the Trump campaign was a part of it, and I believe, at this time, Save America 
14 was a part of it as well. So, as of November 11th, I don't know what the split would've 
15 been. 
16 Q Now, putting aside the split of how the money was actually --the 
17 percentages, but the RNC funds went to whatever the RNC had set up for themselves. 
18 Save America went to whatever account Save America set up for itself, and the Trump 
19 campaign funds would've gone to this segregated account that you reference here. Is 
20 that correct? 
21 A Again, there was a waterfall also that was occurring under the JFA at various 
22 times. I don't know if as of November 11th, the waterfall had, you know, whether it was 
23 a split or whether it was a waterfall within the debt retirement and recount, or whether it 
24 was a waterfall with recount on top and debt retirement below. I mean, I don't know as 
25 of this date -- 15 
1 Q For the purpose of our discussion, once the debt was paid off, as you noted 
2 before, the campaign would've then been raising money for the purposes of recount 
3 expenses, correct? 
4 A Once the debt was paid off --I mean, I don't think debt was paid off until a 
5 lot later because there's --you know, there's trailing expenses, right? So it's not like all 
6 debt was paid off as of a certain date. I'm pretty sure there were trailing expenses. 
7 
8 Q 
A So --
There would've been --there would've been an estimate, I presume, at some 
9 point that was made of what the campaign's debt situation would be, and there would be 
10 fundraising that would occur to meet whatever that estimate is. 
11 Q Yeah. Is it fair to say, which I believe you already testified to, that the funds 
12 that did not go towards the debt, that the campaign fund raised post-election, would've 
13 gone to this segregated or restricted account that you reference here? 
14 A It would have gone --if it did not go --so if it went to DJTFP prior to DJTFP's 
15 conversion into a multi-candidate PAC, and it did not go into debt retirement, then it 
16 would've gone into recount. Is that clear? 
17 - Yeah. And I'm sorry so sorry. I just need to followup. I'm 
18 probably the one who's the worst at this, so bear with me, apologies. 
19 
20 
21 Q 
A 
Q When you said the multi-candidate, that's MAGA PAC? 
That's correct. 
Okay. So, if I understand you, and I want to make sure --if I repeat it, I 
22 have a better chance of making sure I have it right. So, if the funds were raised to DJTFP 
23 and they were not spent on debt retirement, any remaining funds that were not spent on 
24 debt retirement would have gone to this segregated, restricted account for recounts for 
25 MAGA PAC?  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A I believe so. 
Okay. 
Yes. 
I just want to make sure I got it right. 
I mean, that's my understanding of what should've --what should've 16 
6 happened, but, again, there was constant communication between our treasury team and 
7 Jones Day throughout this entire period, so. 
8 Q And we want to make sure it's your understanding, understanding that 
9 you're not the person hitting these buttons and you may not actually know what 
10 happened, just what your understanding of what the process was. 
11 A Okay. 
14 Q Just out of curiosity, and I know this was a while ago, but do you have a ball 
15 park of how much money would've been moved to MAGA PAC after the debt was 
16 retired --after the debt was paid off, do you have any idea how much was then moved 
17 into MAGA PAC, into the segregated, restricted account? 
18 A Well, no, I don't think there would've been money moved into a recount 
19 account. It would've been raised into that account. 
20 Q Oh, then I misunderstood you a moment ago. 
21 A All that happens when a --so, at the end of a campaign, the principal 
22 campaign committee can do one of two things. It can wind down and terminate, or it 
23 can convert into a leadership PAC, or if it meets certain qualifications, it can revert into a 
24 multi-candidate PAC. 
25 The decision was made, with respect to this, predominantly because of a whole  17 
1 host of, you know, legacy civil litigations, that we needed to convert into a 
2 multi-candidate PAC because the FEC would not let us shut down the principal campaign 
3 committee. 
4 Q Okay. And so the money doesn't --it would just sit and convert into MAGA 
5 PAC, and it could only be used for recount. So I guess what I was asking was, after the 
6 debt was retired, do you have any idea how much money was left that could then only be 
7 used for recounts? 
8 A Well, I mean, I object a little bit with --to the way you're leading me to say 
9 that the money could only be used for recounts. 
10 
11 Q 
A Oh, if that's not right, correct me, because if I'm getting it wrong, tell me. 
I'm not going to --I'm not going to get into privileged conversations, and 
12 we've already agreed to that, but there is guidance from the FEC, there are advisory 
13 opinions, that --and specific guidance that was given to us by Jones Day, about what can 
14 and cannot be spent out of a recount account. 
15 Now, the recount account has that name. It has that recount account name, but 
16 there are other expenditures that can be made, provided they're not being used to 
17 influence an election. That is the advice that we got from outside counsel. 
18 Q Okay. So I guess let me rephrase my question, and then you tell me if it's 
19 still wrong. Once the debt retirement was paid, so the debt was paid off, do you have 
20 any idea how much money was left that DJTFP had that would then have to go 
21 somewhere else? 
22 A No, I don't know, but it would've been --it would've been publicly reported. 
23 I don't know if DJTFP would've had any additional money at that point. I just don't know 
24 the answer to that. 
25 I mean, it would --it would all be contained in FEC reports. I mean, everything's  18 
1 publicly reported. So, if money changes accounts or is refunded to another account or 
2 moved to another account, that's all publicly reported. Those reports are all reviewed 
3 by Jones Day. 
Okay. 4 
5 Q 
A As well as staff at the FEC, I'd like to add too, so, you know, we have --we've 
6 been doing this, we've been filing reports now, MAGA PAC, Save America, have been 
7 filing reports now for almost 2 years since election day. 
8 We have yet to even receive a request for additional information from the FEC on 
9 any of the expenditures. And that's a staff level, not talking about the Commissioners 
10 upstairs, I'm talking about staff level at the FEC. 
11 
12 Q 
A --I'm sorry. I didn't mean to cut you off. Go ahead, please finish. 
Was your question, are RFAls common, are requests for additional 
13 information common? 
14 
15 
16 
17 Q 
A 
Q 
A Yes. Do staff members commonly file RFAls? 
Yeah. Those are very common. 
Okay. 
You can get --you can get an RFAI, request for additional information, you 
18 can get those for something as simple as, you know, you used the word "consultant" 
19 when they would prefer that you use the word "contractor." Right? 
20 So these are routine matters that happen at the FEC, and we have --we've not 
21 even received an RFAI, which is why it's sort of, like, you know, I'm a little perplexed as to 
22 why this is something that this committee is looking into, just to be completely honest. 
23 Q When was the last time --you said you haven't received one. How long has 
24 it been since you received an RFAI? 
25 A Oh, I mean, I think it's been quite some time. Again, that would be, you  19 
1 know, a question for --those usually get sent to the treasurers, right, and then they get 
2 forwarded to legal counsel for handling. So --
3 Q Sorry. I just want to make clear who we're talking about. When you say 
4 the treasurer, are you talking about Red Curve, or are you talking about Mr. Doll man? 
5 A I'm talking about --well, it would come through me to Mr. Doll man, but I 
6 would assume that they're sent to --I know that they're sent, actually, to Red Curve if 
7 there's an RFAI. 
8 Q Okay. So, just in terms of understanding the process and making sure 
9 we're using the correct terminology, when you say it would go to the treasurer, it would 
10 go to Red Curve and then presumably to you and Mr. Doll man to respond? 
11 A Yeah. Or to --or to Jones Day to respond. You know, usually those are 
12 handled through either a letter back to the FEC explaining exactly what the report means, 
13 or you do an amendment to a report. 
14 
15 Q 
A Okay. 
That's been my experience. I mean, I haven't --I am aware that RFAls 
16 happen frequently. It's not something that we've gotten a lot from, you know, this 
17 particular committee, which is probably the most scrutinized political committee in the 
18 history of America politics. 
19 
20 
21 Q 
A 
Q Which committee? 
Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. 
Okay. Well, I wasn't sure. There's multiples, so I just want to --we try to 
22 be particular. When you're saying "the committee," I just want to make sure which one 
23 we were talking about. 
24 A Yeah. We were talking about a recount account, so I'm talking about 
25 Donald J. Trump for President, Inc.  1 Q Got it. Okay. Thank you. That is very helpful explanation. 
3 excuse me. 
4 
5 - Sorry about that. 
Mr. Cannon. No, it's okay, you can confuse me with Mr. Dallman. He's 
6 stronger and better looking than I am, so it's fine with me. 
7 BY 
8 Q Mr. Cannon, we're going to have to head to a little later in November of 
9 2020. I'm going to show you what's been marked as exhibit 4. 20 
10 So here --so it's an email that you sent --excuse me --that Mr. Kushner sent you. 
11 The initial email is, Sean Dallman actually sends a cash update, and he talks about: 
12 Below the screenshot for the current position of the three accounts. And those three 
13 accounts, a DJTFP general is the first, recount/legal is the second, and Save America is the 
14 third. 
15 Do you recall receiving these preaudit cash position updates? 
16 A I mean, I recall them because I gave a production to you guys, but I think I 
17 testified previously that, if I hadn't done this production, I never would've recalled 
18 receiving these, because I don't think I ever really paid a whole lot of attention to them. 
19 Q I want to scroll up here, and here Mr. Kushner sent you an email. It says: 
20 I'm traveling for a few days --it's November 29th --he says: When I get back, let's 
21 discuss a new system for paying bills where we need DJT to sign off on them --and that's 
22 Mr. Trump, the President, right, DJT? 
23 
24 A 
Q I assume so, yeah. 
He says: I want to create a tighter process for going forward. We should 
25 have a budget we approve, and it shouldn't go to him unless approved by Sean and Justin  21 
1 and maybe Alex. 
2 And that's talking about a budget going to approval by President Trump, correct? 
3 
4 A 
Q That seems to be what Mr. Kushner's talking about, yes. 
Did you have any other discussions about this so-called new system that 
5 Mr. Kushner is referring to? 
6 A I don't believe this meeting ever happened. I mean, you know, I don't 
7 recall it. I think I had previously testified that I don't recall having a conversation about, 
8 you know, a budget going forward or processes for approvals and things like that. 
9 Q Were you aware of President Trump's involvement in the approvals of 
10 budgets --post-election budgets? 
11 A What time period are we talking about, and what committee are we talking 
12 about? 
13 Q Between --from post-election through the end of the administration, 
14 January 20th, are you aware of President Trump approving any kind of expenditures by 
15 the Trump campaign? 
16 
17 A 
Q No, I'm not aware of that. 
Okay. Going forward, when the campaign converts to MAGA PAC, is 
18 President Trump involved in the process for approving expenses undertaken by MAGA 
19 PAC? 
20 A I don't believe I've ever had a conversation with him about expenses out of 
21 MAGA PAC and whether or not certain things can get paid. 
22 Q Well, broader than what conversations you've had, are you aware, from any 
23 source, about whether President Trump has any involvement with MAGA PAC's 
24 expenses? 
25 A I don't know the process. I mean, it would be --it would be speculation on  1 my part, and I'm just not going to --I'm not going to speculate on how expenses get 
2 approved. 
3 
4 Q 
A Do you know how MAGA PAC expenses get approved? 
No. I mean, it --well, wait a second. What do you mean? That's an 
5 extremely broad question, right? Because there's obviously some expenses that, you 
6 know, are legal expenses that I'm aware of, right? But in terms of what's the process 22 
7 from receiving a bill to a wire going out or a check being cut, in granular detail, no, I don't 
8 know that. 
9 Q Well, and I appreciate the clarification. You just testified, as far as 
10 President Trump's involvement from the election day to January 20th, you don't have any 
11 knowledge as to whether or not he was involved in the approval of expenses. Is that 
12 correct? 
13 
14 A 
Q That's correct. 
Now, going after January 20th, and I believe in February when MAGA PAC 
15 emerges as an entity, are you aware of whether President Trump has any involvement in 
16 the approval of MAGA PAC's expenses, in any way? 
17 A I --I just --it's --I don't know. I don't know for sure. Okay? I don't know 
18 for sure. 
19 - It's okay to say you don't know, Mr. Cannon. We --this is literally 
20 what we're trying to find out, is, who are the people that have the information about the 
21 process, because our understanding is, is that a lot of people left, a lot of people don't 
22 work for them anymore. 
23 It's who was at MAGA PAC or who was running these things or what happened 
24 after the transition, that's what we're trying to find out. So, if you're not the proper 
25 person who doesn't know, that's fine.  23 
1 If you know who a better person is, who handles the mechanics of that stuff, and 
2 say, "Oh, actually I'm not the person, this would be the person," that would be super 
3 helpful too. 
4 So, if you don't know, we don't want to ask the wrong people the information. 
5 But if you do know who the proper person is, we understand people change, just that 
6 would be helpful too, so that's fine. 
7 BY 
8 
9 Q 
A Do you know who is tasked with the approving expenses for MAGA PAC? 
Yeah, I mean, I believe --so when you say "approving expenses," this is one I 
10 really want to make sure we're on the same page, okay, because we may receive, you 
11 know, a bill, from a law firm that's representing us in, you know, some civil litigation. 
12 Okay? I'll take a look at that because a lot of times I end up working with these people, 
13 right? So I'll take a look at that and say: Okay. This seems to make sense. 
14 Generally I respond with "this looks good to me" or "hang on, I'm going to call this 
15 outside counsel and figure out what the deal is with the bill." 
16 After that, I don't know the process. 
17 
18 Q 
A Well, what do you do? What's your last step in the process? 
My last step in the process is sending an email to somebody who's on the 
19 accounts payable group --it could be Mr. Dallman; it could be Kalina (ph) --and saying: 
20 Hey, this bill looks good to me. 
21 Q So is there anyone --to the extent there's a hierarchy, is there anyone more 
22 senior than you that you would confer with or otherwise get approval from before saying 
23 yes to someone like Mr. Doll man or Kalina (ph)? 
24 A No, there's no one that I would go higher to. They'd go --would go up to 
25 probably Susie Wiles.  1 
2 And Ms. Wiles works for MAGA PAC? 
Mr. Cannon. I mean, she's --she --I don't know exactly what her employment 
3 situation is. 
4 And I'll note for the --sorry, I'll note for the record that 
5 Mr. Aguilar has joined the Webex. 
6 Mr. Cannon, feel free to continue your answer. 
7 Mr. Cannon. So I was saying I think that ultimately I don't know whether the 24 
8 former President approves expenses, whether Susie Wiles approves expenses, or whether 
9 it's some combination of the two. 
10 BY 
11 Q So an expense comes --and do all expenses typically come to you first, or is 
12 there another entry point? 
13 
14 A 
Q No, no, no, no, no. Only things that relate to legal. 
Okay. So a legal expense comes from you; you may do some due diligence 
15 to see it's right on your end. You then send that --you then give an approval for 
16 payment to someone like Mr. Doi Iman or Kalina (ph), and then they, for lack of a better 
17 term, go up the chain to get additional approval separate from you? 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A That's my understanding. 
And who do you understand to be up the chain from Mr. Dallman? 
Well, I thought I just answered that. 
Is it just --is it Susie Wiles and then President Trump? 
I --I mean, I think it's --again, I don't know what happens after Sean. 
23 believe that there's a report that gets sent to Susie. I don't know what the approval 
24 process is after me saying: Hey, this legal expense looks good. This bill, this law firm's 
25 bill looks good.  1 
2 Q 25 
BY 
Mr. Cannon, do you know the relationship between Mr. Doi Iman and 
3 Ms. Wiles, whether she's above him, whether --how that process works? 
4 
5 A 
Q Yeah. I think she's --she's effectively everyone's supervisor. 
Okay. And when you say "everyone," understanding that you don't know 
6 exactly who her employer may be or who actually pays her salary, when you say she's 
7 supervising everyone, is it your understanding that she's supervising everyone at MAGA 
8 PAC? 
9 A I mean, everyone at MAGA --I don't know how to --I don't --it's not 
10 like --this isn't like corporate America, you know. I know that that's --it would be so 
11 much more satisfying if it was, but it's --you know, it's a --it's a leadership PAC, and 
12 people provide certain services to this PAC, provide certain services to other PACs, 
13 provide services --I just don't --
14 Q No, that's very helpful. But if you can explain, like, when you say it's not 
15 like corporate America, in what sense? In the sense that, well, they don't all have one 
16 employer? They could be doing the job --like, can you unpack that for me because it's 
17 
18 helpful -­
A There's people --there's people that volunteer their time. There's people 
19 that are 1099 consultants. There's people that are W-2 employees. People move 
20 around a lot, you know. 
21 Q So, if I'm understanding you, I'm oversimplifying it when I say, quote, they're 
22 working for MAGA because that makes it sound like one entity is employing all of them, 
23 but it could be that they're collectively doing work for MAGA and paid by all --by 
24 different organizations or structured differently and possibly not even be employees. Is 
25 that a fair re-characterization?  26 
1 A Yeah, I think --I mean, for some --some people might be employees. Some 
2 people might have their own consulting businesses. I don't know whether --what 
3 they're charging what clients, what they're doing. 
4 Q So is it more accurate for me to say the work that they're doing for MAGA 
5 PAC that Ms. Wiles is reviewing in some capacity? 
6 
7 A Yeah. I mean --go ahead. 
Mr. Benson. Pardon me, pardon me. I mean, I think you're asking Mr. Cannon 
8 for speculation. I don't know what the point of that is. 
9 - I'm asking Mr. Cannon to clarify because he clearly has expertise in 
10 this area, and in our attempts to be clear --and what I don't want to do is to accidentally 
11 misstate something, to Mr. Cannon's point, if my experience in corporate America is 
12 making it so that I'm not asking the question properly. 
13 His explanation and clarification is very helpful. He provided, based on his 
14 knowledge and expertise, a very helpful explanation that then prevents me from 
15 miswording the question. So that was incredibly helpful. I didn't see it as speculation. 
16 My understanding was, it was an explanation based on knowledge and expertise. 
17 Mr. Benson. That is fine. You know, whatever you think is helpful is fine, but, 
18 you know, it's calling --asking him to speculate who approves what, where, when 
19 probably doesn't make a lot of sense. And I just want to remind you that --
20 
21 
22 - No, I'm just asking for his understanding of the process. 
Mr. Benson. --I want to remind you that we have a hard stop at 3 o'clock, so. 
Yes, sir. I just want to --we wanted his understanding of the 
23 process, and I think he's provided that. 
24 
25 Mr. Benson. Great. 
BY  27 
1 Q All right. Mr. Cannon, let's move forward to the formation of MAGA PAC in 
2 February of 2021. Were you involved in that process, the formation or conversion of 
3 Trump campaign to MAGA PAC? 
4 
5 A 
Q I would've been aware of it, yeah. 
And who handled it? Who was, you know --if you were aware, who was 
6 the person who was actually handling the actual nitty-gritty of that work? Was that 
7 outside counsel? 
8 A I don't know how nitty-gritty it is. I think it's just filing a form with the FEC. 
9 That would've been probably Red Curve. 
10 Q And when the Trump campaign converted to MAGA PAC, were you aware of 
11 the amount of money the Trump campaign had on hand, cash, from its post-election 
12 fundraising? 
13 
14 
15 
16 A 
Q 
A 
Q No, I don't believe so. 
Is it fair to say the Trump campaign did have millions of dollars on hand? 
I don't know. Whatever it would be, would be in an FEC report. 
Now, prior to --prior to the administration --the conversion to MAGA PAC, 
17 who on the campaign team was responsible for --let me rephrase that. 
18 What involvement, if any, did you have in disclosures made to the FEC about what 
19 an expense was? So, when you look at FEC reports, it indicates, here's what an expense 
20 is. What involvement did you have, and if you weren't involved, who did you 
21 understand to be involved from the campaign side? 
22 A No, I wasn't reviewing FEC reports or filling in FEC descriptions. Are you 
23 asking about the descriptions in the reports? 
24 
25 Q 
A Yes, sir. 
Yeah. The descriptions would've been probably done based on GL codes  1 that kick something out into a report. That would've been reviewed by, you know, 
2 probably internally at Red Curve, and it would've been reviewed by Jones Day. 
And when you say "GL code," what is a GL code? 
A general ledger code. 
Can you give us a little bit of detail how that works? 28 
3 
4 
5 
6 Q 
A 
Q 
A No, I can't tell you how it works. I just know that there's a whole bunch of 
7 codes that go in for certain types of expenditures, right, whether it's a legal expense or 
8 whether it's, you know, an administrative expense, a supply expense. 
9 Q So an expense comes in and when someone's putting it for the purposes of 
10 an FEC disclosure, this is when they use this GL code? 
11 A No. I think when it's getting processed for payment, there's a GL code 
12 used. Again, I think this is something that Mr. Doll man probably could speak better to 
13 than me. 
14 Q Okay. And is there someone --are you aware of anyone, besides kind of 
15 the accounts receivable folks or the kind of number crunchers, would you expect that 
16 someone on the campaign who would have substantive knowledge of the expense would 
17 be included in the process? Meaning, they would weigh in as to whether or not that GL 
18 code was accurate? 
19 
20 A 
Q Whether the GL code is accurate, no. 
Or the use of it. Let me simplify. So what I'm trying to understand is that 
21 an expense comes in, the campaign pays for something, $80,000. That then ends up on 
22 a FEC disclosure form listed a certain way, right? 
23 So someone at Red Curve, they don't work for the campaign, they can't say that 
24 expense is, in fact, this thing to be disclosed. I'm trying to get an insight from you, to the 
25 extent you have it, from an expense coming in, what's your awareness as to how that  29 
1 ends up on an FEC disclosure as a certain item? 
2 A I don't know the answer to that. I mean, I assume Red Curve gets the 
3 invoices and they take a look at it. I mean, the treasurer has --you know, is the ultimate 
4 party that has responsibility for the FEC report. So I assume there's a pretty significant 
5 amount of diligence that takes place. This is how these people make their living. 
6 They're professionals. 
7 BY-
8 Q When you're saying "treasurer," we're talking about Red Curve? I just want 
9 to be clear that we're not misunderstanding when you say "treasurer." 
10 
11 
12 
13 A 
Q 
A 
Q When I say "treasurer," I'm talking about Bradley Crate --
Okay. 
--who is listed on the Form ls. 
Thank you. Okay. Because I continuously forget Mr. Doll man's title, and I 
14 thought he was treasurer of DJTFP at one point. So I just want to make sure we're 
15 talking about the proper treasurer. 
16 A Okay. 
18 the person responsible in doing the due diligence to ensure an FEC disclosure is true and 
19 accurate? 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 Mr. Cannon. I mean, what do you mean by true and accurate, like what -­
Mr. Benson. Alex, if you know. 
Mr. Cannon. Him or someone on his team. 
BY-
Q And is it --to the extent that you know, because what we're trying to figure 
25 out, presumably there's some interaction between the people who know what these  30 
1 expenses are, because Mr. Crate is a separate entity. But are there people from Red 
2 Curve who sit with the committee and have a substantive knowledge, or does the 
3 committee give that information to Red Curve, if you know? 
4 A During the campaign, the entire treasury team were Red Curve folks, I think, 
5 maybe with the exception of Sean Doi Iman. 
6 
7 
8 Q 
A 
Q Okay. So they sit in the sauce, so to speak -­
Yes. 
--seeing what the expenses are, and then they provide these GL codes. 
9 And I think earlier you said something along the lines of, at some point there might be 
10 Jones Day interaction with the Red Curve folks? Did I --
11 A Yeah, there would've been --if there was ever a question about how 
12 something was categorized, there would've been conversations with Jones Day. 
13 Q Would Red Curve have those conversations, or would somebody from the 
14 campaign or the committee have those conversations? 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q I don't know. 
Okay. 
It depends. 
Okay. Could it be both? 
Yeah, it could be both. 
Okay. And so those conversations would happen, and then it's your 
21 understanding that as treasurer, Red Curve would enter that information in the FEC 
22 filings. That's their job as the treasurer? 
23 A It creates a report. The reports are reviewed by outside counsel. They 
24 get filed with the commission. 
25 Q Okay. Got it.  1 That's helpful, Mr. Cannon. 
2 All right, Mr. Cannon, and thank you for giving us --we're trying to be efficient 
3 with your time, so we may take little moments here and there to make sure we're 
4 moving at a good pace. 
5 We're watching that 3 o'clock clock, I promise, so we're trying to be 
6 effective. 
7 
8 
9 Q Yeah. Yeah, we are. 
All right, Mr. Cannon, I want to move ahead and talk --I think your counsel 
10 has previewed that we want to talk a bit about the work with the National Archives and 
11 the relation to some disclosed payments from MAGA PAC and get a sense of that with 
12 you. 31 
13 So can you tell us about when you first started working with --or MAGA PAC first 
14 started working with 2M Management? When was that, about when? 
15 A I'm not sure the exact date. It would've been sometime in, you know, first 
16 or second quarter of 2021. 
17 Q And what triggered that? 
18 A There was a House Oversight investigation into the administration's COVID 
19 response, and there were a large number of documents that were coming through that 
20 needed to be processed. 
21 Q Okay. So there's a request. Those documents are then --it's 
22 President Trump's records --and then is Mr. Trump provide --given an opportunity to 
23 review those documents before they're disclosed to the House committee? Is that 
24 right? 
25 A That's a summary of the Presidential Records Act.  32 
1 Q Yeah. 
2 As long as we got --
3 BY 
4 Q Okay. And can you briefly explain what it is that 2M Management does for 
5 MAGA PAC? 
6 A They're an e-discovery vendor. 
7 Q So they do --effectively they review --a first level review of documents for 
8 privilege and other related matters, something of the sort, and they process the 
9 documents? 
10 A Yeah. So you get, you know, 30,000 emails that need to be turned around 
11 in 15 days, and they'll take a first cut through that. 
12 Q And after, the second cut, then that's when --after the second cut, you or 
13 Mr. Clark may come in, Justin Clark, and review those documents then? 
14 
15 
16 A Correct. 
BY 
Q A moment ago you said the House Oversight into COVID Response, was that 
17 the Select Committee on COVID, or was it a different committee? 
18 
19 
20 
21 A 
Q 
A Sorry. It was Select Committee on COVID. I apologize. 
No. It's okay. I just wanted to clarify --
I'm referring to you guys as the select committee. 
Q We're not that select. There's actually multiple select committees as it 
22 turns out. 
23 
24 
25 A Yeah. I'm learning this. 
BY 
Q Yeah. So initially the MAGA PAC, or MAGA PAC/Elections LLC engaged 2M  33 
1 to handle the response to the COVID Committee's request though, right? 
Yes, sir. 2 
3 A 
Q Okay. At that initial time, so let's go, I believe your retained --the retainer 
4 to 2M is dated April 14th of 2021. Public disclosure stating the first payment is --it's 
5 March 30th of 2021. So, around the March/ April time, does that sound right, that's 
6 when this process --around when this process was up and going with 2M? 
7 
8 A 
Q Yeah, I believe so. 
And you also produced a variety of documents related to conversations with 
9 Melra (ph) that had to both do with the Select Committee on January 6th and with the 
10 COVID Committee. It appears, on reviewing these documents and other information we 
11 received, that for the first, at least through the summer if not late summer, the work that 
12 2M was doing with regard to the National Archives records, all have to do with the COVID 
13 Committee's request. Is that correct? 
14 A Yeah, with respect to Archives. I don't remember when the first --when 
15 the first request came in from January 6th, but, yes. 
16 Q I believe --1 believe the first request was actually not the January 6th 
17 Committee but a variety of House committees. But based on your production, I believe 
18 the first notice of a production for January 6th was around August 30th --was on August 
19 30th is what I note for the first production being ready. Does that sound consistent with 
20 your memory? 
21 
22 A 
Q Probably, yes. 
Okay. Now, for the approval process regarding payments to 2M 
23 Management, were you in charge of that? 
24 A I mean, the invoices would've been sent to either me or Justin Clark. 
25 Sometimes they were sent to Sean Dallman.  1 Q 
2 with those? 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A And when an invoice came in from 2M Management, what would you do 
I'd review it. 
And, if you approved it, what happened next? 
I'd say it's approved for payment. 
And who would you tell that to? 
Someone on the treasury team. It would've either been Mr. --whoever 
8 sent me the invoice. It could've been any number of people. It was usually either 
9 Mr. Doi Iman or a young lady named Kalina (ph), and I'm blanking on her last name. 
10 
11 
12 Q 
A 
Q And does Kalina (ph) work for Red Curve? 
I believe so, but I'm not certain. 
And, after that process, you approved it, did you have an understanding as 
13 to what happened next? 
14 
15 A 
Q No. I mean, it got paid. 
Okay. Was there anyone else besides you that would have to approve it 
16 before it got paid? 
17 A Yeah, I think --I mean, that's what I'm saying. I think it --there was like 
18 a --I think that there's approval level above Sean. I'm just not sure what it looks like. 
19 
20 
21 Q 
Q Okay. BY-
And, just to be clear to that point, without going into the details and any 
22 kind of work product, your review of it is because you are --Elections LLC is the counsel, 
23 and you're reviewing it for substantive? Did they do the work? Like, is it consistent 34 
24 with what we directed them to do? It's a substantive review of what they're billing you 
25 for, correct? It's not approval for it to be paid; it's a confirmation that that was, in fact,  35 
1 the work performed, and from our perspective, they did that? 
2 A Yeah, that's correct. 
3 Q Okay. The question of whether it gets approved to be paid or whether 
4 there's any negotiation, anything beyond that, would be either somebody at MAGA PAC 
5 or --I mean, I don't know that Red Curve does that, but that would be somebody else in 
6 the process, right? 
7 
8 bills. 
9 
10 
11 A 
Q 
Q If there's any --well, I mean, yeah, I'm not aware of any negotiation on 2M 
Okay. 
BY 
Okay. Now, Mr. Doi Iman, we've looked at the --and I think it's clear what 
12 the focus of our inquiry here, what we want to gain an understanding from you. We've 
13 looked at the FEC disclosures related to the payment that 2M Document Management, 
14 what we are calling 2M, and those FEC disclosures indicate how the --for the vast 
15 majority of these expenses indicate a disbursement description of recount research 
16 consulting and are all labeled as recount. 
17 Is that something you were aware of at the time, that they were being labeled as 
18 such for FEC purposes? 
19 A Are you saying that every 2M bill is labeled as recount? I don't think that's 
20 the case. 
21 Q No, I'm not saying that. I'm saying the vast majority, and the ones that are 
22 not labeled recount research consulting are labeled research consulting. And I'm happy 
23 to show you a summary if that's helpful. 
24 
25 A 
Q If you want to show it to me, I'm happy to take a look at it. I don't know -­
Sure. I'll show you what we've marked as exhibit 5. This is basically an  36 
1 export of the FEC payments that MAGA PAC has made to 2M Management to the present 
2 day that have been disclosed. 
3 
4 A 
Q Okay. 
So you can see, it has under "disbursement description," it has --that's 
5 what's been provided to the FEC. And then the FEC documents, as we understand them, 
6 allow for an indication when something is recount --is a recount expense, as we've been 
7 discussing earlier with the recount account, and here it indicates for those items that 
8 have been labeled recount research consulting or labeled also recount. 
9 And then some items, starting in March of this year, do not have a recount label, 
10 instead are just labeled as research consulting. So, going back to last year, when these 
11 disbursements begin, were you aware that these, at the time they were disclosed, were 
12 being labeled as recount research consulting? 
13 
14 
15 
16 A 
Q 
A 
Q I don't know. 
As in you don't recall? 
Yeah, I don't recall what my knowledge was at the time. 
Okay. Prior to me just telling you this, were you aware that the FEC 
17 disclosures labeled the payments to 2M as recount? 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 - Wait a minute. 
Okay. I think your lawyer might've --
1 think Mr. Benson got kicked out. Hold on one second. 
Dan, are you back in? 
Mr. Benson. Yeah. Now I can --I'm back in now. 
Okay. How long were you gone? Anything --did you 
24 miss --I don't know how long you were out for. 
25 Mr. Benson. Like a minute, I guess, something like that. Right before you put  37 
1 up this document, I think. 
2 All right. So, just to catch you up, Dan, what I pointed 
3 out so far is that there's a column that says "disbursement description." It says "recount 
4 research consulting," and I asked Mr. Cannon whether at the time, going back to March of 
5 last year, whether he was aware that the FEC disclosures listed the payments to 2M as 
6 recount. And Mr. Cannon said --
7 
8 Mr. Cannon, you want to tell us again what your answer to that was? 
Mr. Cannon. Yeah, I just don't recall at the time, you know, whether I knew they 
9 were being --it was recount or not recount at that time. 
10 BY 
11 Q I just want to draw a distinction. Are you saying you don't recall whether it 
12 was disclosed as such, or you don't recall whether or not it had anything to do with 
13 recount? I wanted to see how broad of a response you gave me. 
14 A All of the above. I mean, I just don't --I'm not involved in that level of 
15 granularity with respect to how things get reported. 
16 Q Okay. Are you involved with respect to where the funds are coming from 
17 that pay for 2M services? 
18 
19 A 
Q I mean, again, to the best of my knowledge --
And, just to be clear, I'm not asking you whether something is justifiably 
20 labeled as something or not. I'm just asking, do you have knowledge as to where these 
21 funds are coming from? 
22 A At a certain point, probably, but I mean, we would've had broad discussions, 
23 and I don't recall those discussions, but they would've involved outside counsel. 
24 Q Now, earlier you --we saw that you were aware that the campaign had a 
25 recount account that you referenced with Ms. Mitchell, and you reference it in other  38 
1 documents. Are the funds that are being paid to 2M here, did any of those funds come 
2 from that account? 
3 A If it's labeled recount, I would assume so, but I mean, I'm not tracking 
4 dollars. 
5 Q And, when you say you assume so, is that because you assume that it's 
6 being --
7 
8 
9 this? 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 A I assume the accuracy of the report. 
Mr. Benson. Pardon me, Alex. Do you have personal knowledge of that --of 
Mr. Cannon. Of the report? 
Mr. Benson. Of the question --of the answer to the question. 
Did they just freeze? 
Mr. Cannon. No, I'm here. I don't know if Dan froze. 
Mr. Benson. I'm here. Can you hear me? 
15 Mr. Cannon. Sitting here right now, I do not know exactly the discussions that 
16 took place on how 2M's bills would be allocated. But I'm --that's it. 
17 BY 
18 Q Sorry, sir. Can you repeat that again? So sitting here today, you're not 
19 aware of what? 
20 A I'm not aware of any specific bill or --I'm aware that discussions took place. 
21 I can't get to any level of granularity with you on, like, specific bills and specific --you 
22 know, what was allocated to what. I just have to assume that what you guys put up, 
23 which is something that you all created based on an FEC report, is accurate. 
24 
25 Q Well--
I'm sorry. When you say you're aware that discussions took place,  39 
1 can you unpack that? What do you mean you're aware that discussions took place?  40 
1 
2 [2:00 p.m.] 
3 Mr. Cannon. As I said from the beginning, every expenditure that was made out 
4 of the recount fund was consistent with advice that we received from outside counsel, 
5 and that outside counsel was Jones Day. 
6 BY 
7 Q Okay. Oh. All right. So you're saying, based on reviewing what we put 
8 in front of you that said "recount:", based on your understanding of how every 
9 expenditure from the recount fund would go, there would have been some discussion 
10 between Red Curve --or, excuse me, I don't want to put words in your 
11 mouth --somebody at MAGA PAC and outside counsel? Is that fair? 
12 
13 
14 A 
Q 
A Not for every line item. 
No, no. I'm --
Every time you get legal advice from somebody, you don't go back and ask 
15 for it again, right? You get advice and you follow the advice. 
16 Q Okay. So --and that's what we're trying to unpack. 
17 So what you said a moment ago, "aware of discussions," it's based on your 
18 understanding that for recount expenses there's at least one discussion had as to 
19 whether, we'll say, a certain type of expense could be qualified as that. And so your 
20 understanding is there would've been discussions with Jones Day outside counsel at least 
21 one or more times about those expenses because it says "recount"? 
22 
23 A 
Q Correct. 
Okay. 
24 And if I'm understanding you, you're not in those discussions; you just understand 
25 the process enough to know, if it says "recount," at some point there would've been a  41 
1 discussion between Jones Day and somebody at MAGA PAC. 
2 A I mean, I'm not going --again, I'm not going to get into the substance, but I 
3 think you're putting words in my mouth by saying I was not involved in any of those 
4 conversations. 
5 Q Oh, no, no. Sorry. That was the impression I got when you said you had 
6 an awareness. If you were involved in those conversations, correct me. I just got the 
7 impression you weren't. I'm not trying to put words in your mouth. 
8 
9 
10 Were you involved in those conversations? 
A 
Q Yes. 
Okay. So your awareness of those conversations comes from being 
11 involved in the conversations with people at MAGA PAC and Jones Day about what could 
12 be used for recount expenses. 
13 
14 
15 
16 A 
Q 
Q Correct. 
Okay. 
BY 
And, Mr. Cannon, when we see disbursements being labeled as "recount" in 
17 FEC disclosures, it's your understanding that that indicates that that would've been paid 
18 from what we've been calling the recount account. Is that fair? 
19 
20 A 
Q I believe in the accuracy of the reporting. 
And so, based on that belief, is what I said then accurate, that, based on your 
21 belief, that these disclosures are indicating that the payments came from what we've 
22 been calling the recount account? 
23 A If that document you put in front of me --it's not an FEC report. That's a 
24 summary you guys had put. 
25 Yeah. It's -- 42 
1 Mr. Cannon. You're asking me to verify one of your documents that you've 
2 created. 
3 BY 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Well, it's just the export Excel from FEC. You know how you export -­
Okay. I mean, I don't know that. It's not our report, right? 
No, no --
You're not showing me portions of the report. 
Right. No, I'm telling you that just so you feel more comfortable about 
9 what we're showing you, that it's just the export function of the FEC website. It's just, it 
10 comes in an Excel, and we made it into something that was understandable, because the 
11 columns are kind of ugly. So it's just something that's easier for your eyeballs to see, but 
12 it's an export of FEC data, effectively. 
13 A Okay. Yeah. If that's all correct and it shows that it's recount, then, yes, it 
14 would be my understanding that it'd be paid out of recount. 
15 Q Mr. Cannon, if you'd feel more comfortable, it's a little trickier and it's not as 
16 pretty, but we can pull up the FEC website and use that. I mean, I don't want you to 
17 have any concerns about that. It's just easier on the eyes in the format that we put it 
18 into, an Excel spreadsheet. 
19 But I don't want you to have any concerns about where that data is coming from 
20 or its accuracy. So if you --I'm cognizant of the time, but I also want you to be 
21 comfortable with what we're showing you. So if you'd like us to do that, we are happy 
22 to do that. 
23 A Well, no, I think I've answered the question. If it's labeled on the report as 
24 "recount," it's my understanding it would've been paid out of recount. 
25 Q Okay.  43 
1 And just to be clear --because I think you've made this clear --because it said 
2 "recount," not on every single expense, but you would've consulted with Jones Day about 
3 whether it could be qualified as such? 
4 
5 
6 
7 A 
Q 
Q There were conversations with Jones Day. 
Okay. 
BY 
Now, Mr. Cannon, we also talked --you provided a variety of invoices related 
8 to work from 2M Management, and I just want to briefly go over some of those items and 
9 just get a sense of --without getting into privileged conversations with counsel, but just 
10 so we can get a sense of what you meant by some of the labels on some of these 
11 redactions. 
12 So, starting with --there are a variety of retainers that you produced paying an 
13 initial fee --initial amount. The first payment, according to FEC disclosures, is for 
14 $650,000. But then there are what appear to be $100,000-a-month retainers being paid 
15 to 2M Management. Is that correct? 
16 
17 A 
Q That's correct. 
And when we look at those payments going in March and then May and 
18 going through the summer, those payments would've been in regards to responding to 
19 the COVID committee's request to NARA. Is that right? 
20 A 
21 of work. 
22 
23 Q 
A I don't know what other work they were doing now. I mean, 2M does a lot 
2M does a lot of work for MAGA PAC you're saying? 
Yeah. I mean, we have civil litigations that are ongoing, one of which 
24 relates to the Coomer case, right, which is a defamation case that a Dominion employee 
25 brought. There are technology fees. There's research projects that they undertake.  44 
1 I mean, you know, all these questions are --you're going down a path where 
2 you're really starting to call for privilege here on a whole host of issues. 
3 I did my best to provide you guys with information that you needed to do the 
4 math exercise that I understand you wanted to without waving privilege that's not mine 
5 to wave. 
6 And that's very helpful. And we definitely want to --I mean, we may 
7 not necessarily agree where the parameters of the privilege are, but to the extent that 
8 you feel that they're somewhere, like, we definitely, you know, want to have that 
9 discussion. It's obviously not our intention to go into privileged material. We may not 
10 agree on where the privilege line is, but we certainly want to approach it with caution and 
11 have that discussion if that comes up. 
12 BY 
13 Q Now, Mr. Cannon, it's our understanding from our investigation thus far 
14 that, while 2M did other work, the vast majority of work that MAGA PAC has been billed 
15 for through the summer is related to the COVID committee's request. 
16 Do you have any reason to think that that's not accurate? 
17 A I just don't know exactly everything they were doing at that point. I mean, 
18 we may have brought them on to do some research as well into some of the stuff that 
19 happened on January 6th. 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q When you say you may have, is that something that you're recalling? Or -­
Yeah, recalling --I'm --
--when you say "recalling" -­
I'm recalling that. 
Okay. So you're saying in the summer there was work that 2M was 
25 brought on to research regarding what happened on the 6th?  45 
A Yeah, I mean, after the COVID stuff. 1 
2 Q Now, when you say "after," when that was complete, or --I just want to get 
3 a sense of just timing. 
4 
5 A I don't know. 
These guys are really, really good. These guys are really good. They do a lot of 
6 work for us. It falls into different categories. We do our best to categorize it 
7 appropriately. 
8 That's it. 
9 
10 Q Okay. 
Now, starting in November of 2021 --you provided an invoice that's labeled 
11 "November 18, 2021," that has a redaction, "COVID NARA." And then, from then on, we 
12 then have a variety of different --it looks like the items start being broken out. Like you 
13 just said, you were doing your best to break them out. 
14 Is it fair to say that initially MAGA PAC was paying just a pure retainer but then 
15 later on attempted to break out the work by invoice? 
16 A Yeah, I think as they started to take on more work, we started to ask them to 
17 create additional sub-matters. 
18 Q Okay. And so when we see redacted "COVID NARA," for example, did that 
19 relate to a request from the COVID committee for documents from the National 
20 Archives? 
21 
22 A Yes. 
Q And when we see "civil litigation/other," does that refer to, like, the 
23 Dominion case you just talked about, other litigation that the campaign might be involved 
24 in that may be something else but it's just pure civil litigation, not related to NARA? 
25 A Correct.  1 Q And when we see "J6 NARA" listed in some, is that request from the 
2 subcommittee on January 6th to NARA for documents and their work related to 
3 processing those documents? 
4 
5 
6 A 
Q 
A Correct. 
And when we see "J6 other," what does that relate to? 
So they may be processing documents and have relationships with people 46 
7 who are represented by counsel that came in and produced documents to you guys --or 
8 to your committee. 
9 Q So, for example, if our committee asked a Trump 
10 campaign employee --former employee for documents, MAGA PAC may have paid their 
11 expenses of processing those documents in order to be produced to the Select 
12 Committee on January 6th? 
13 
14 A 
Q They may have paid for those expenses, yeah. 
Okay. And when those expenses were approved --let's call them the 
15 third-party witnesses --were you involved with approving those expenses? 
16 A I mean, I would see the invoices, right? But I have no visibility into what 
17 outside counsel was doing with 2M or counsel for a third party was doing with 2M. 
18 Q So, if someone from MAGA PAC, for example --this is just a 
19 hypothetical --Mr. Dallman has his documents produced through 2M Management, do 
20 you or anyone else at MAGA PAC have ability to see Mr. Dollman's documents or 
21 otherwise involved substantively in that process? 
22 A No. No, we wouldn't see the documents that would be processed. That 
23 would be --I would never do that. 
24 BY-: 
25 Q Real quickly, is there an approval process? If a third party wants to use 2M  47 
1 and have MAGA PAC cover the expense, how would a third-party witness go through that 
2 process or get approval to be --
3 
4 
5 A 
Q 
A In the same way that they would get, you know, legal fees paid, right? 
What is that process, to the extent that you know? 
I mean, you know, it can come in from multiple angles. It could be 
6 somebody calls Susie, somebody calls Sean, somebody calls Justin. We ask Susie, is this 
7 something that, you know, we're willing to help this person out? There's a process. A 
8 lot of that process is privileged too, right? 
9 Q Well, actually, usually, the information on who's paying attorney fees isn't 
10 privileged --
11 A No, but the process and how we make a determination on whether or not an 
12 individual is going to have their --gets an assistance is privileged. 
13 Q And, to be clear, I'm not asking about your internal deliberations as to how 
14 you decide whether to do that. I was asking in terms of the general process. 
15 Sounds like you say somebody reaches out to, I think you identified Susie, 
16 Justin --I don't remember who the other person was --Sean? 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 A It may be me; it may be Sean. I mean, somebody says: Hey, I got 
contacted by the committee. You know, they want documents. 
testify. Do you guys have --is there any money --I have counsel. 
pay my legal bills? 
Q Okay. They want me to 
Can you guys help 
22 And presumably some people may want help with attorney's fees and e-discovery, 
23 and some people may have counsel and just want e-discovery, and that's just --do they 
24 decide that? Do you decide that? 
25 A We have a vendor that is doing a ton of work. And if they want to use the  48 
1 vendor, it's fine that they use the vendor. That's it. I mean, that's what it comes down 
2 to. 
3 Q Okay. 
4 And then, without getting into the deliberations, there is a process that they can 
5 go through to request whether MAGA PAC will cover the expenses of that vendor? 
6 A Yeah. If it's a --if it's --I mean, yeah. I mean, again, like I said, we have a 
7 vendor. We already have a vendor. It's incredibly expensive to stand one up. They 
8 have done e-discovery work in connection with your committee --
9 
10 
11 Q 
A 
Q Okay. 
--for other individuals who were represented by counsel. 
And without going into --you know, again, we just want to make sure that 
12 when you say redact---the classifications that we just went over, those are --actually, I 
13 think we're going to talk about --let me retract that. 
14 Go back onto your --I want to be cognizant of the time and I don't want to get us 
15 off track, so --
16 Mr. Cannon, if you could give us just 2 minutes. 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 Mr. Cannon. All right. I'm going to run to the restroom. 
Let's take just a couple-minute break. 
Thank you, sir. 
[Recess.] 
Mr. Cannon, are you ready to go? 
Mr. Cannon. Yeah. I want to just clarify one thing just so that we're clear. 
2M was only doing COVID work when they started. That was what we initially 
25 hired them for. But we were doing and asking them to do quite a bit of research, you  49 
1 know, into the events that occurred on January 6th, as well, and get an understanding of 
2 what was out there and what was in the public. 
3 And, you know, that's all work product; that's all privileged. But they were doing 
4 quite a bit of research for us as well, which is why the retainer, frankly, says it's research.

10 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q So, I guess, question: Who would've given them that instruction? 
I mean, it would've come from, you know, me. 
You alone, or could it have come from Mr. Clark? 
Yeah, I mean, you know, we worked together. 
Okay. And, to be clear, when you say "it would've come from me," do you 
11 remember giving that instruction? 
12 
13 A 
Q I mean, I remember talking to them about doing research, yes. 
And would you have had that conversation with Matt Clarke, or would you 
14 have had that conversation with anyone else at 2M? 
15 A It would've been --Matt's the person I talk to at 2M, unless there's, like, a 
16 technical issue that I don't understand. 
17 Q Okay. So your instructions regarding what 2M should've been doing from 
18 the beginning would've been from you directly to Matt Clarke? 
19 A I mean, or Justin Clark. Yeah. I mean, we had conversations about the 
20 scope of their engagement. 
21 
22 Q Okay. 
And you kind of opened this door, so I don't want to go too far in, and I'm trying to 
23 keep it to where you've opened it. But would you have emailed those instructions to 
24 him or would you have had verbal conversations about what the scope of their research 
25 should've been?  1 
2 
3 
4 A 
Q 
Q 
5 research? 50 
It would've been all verbal conversations. 
Okay.

A So, effectively, like, just searching online what was happening with the 6th? 
I mean, I'm not going to get into the details of what they were researching, 
9 but it would have involved on line research, yes. 
10 Q Well, I guess what I'm --your suggestion seemed to be that 2M --that it's 
11 labeled "research consulting" because they were doing research. But 2M is an 
12 e-discovery company, correct? 
13 
14 A 
Q That is --that is one of the services that they perform, yes. 
That is the service that they're --that is the core of what Matt Clarke 
15 provides to clients, is it not? 
16 A No, I can't speak to all of his other clients, but that is a lot of the work they 
17 do for us. They also do some research for us. 
18 Q And the vast majority of the work they do for you is related to their 
19 e-discovery tools, correct? 
20 
21 
22 A 
Q 
A That's the vast majority of my interactions with them. 
Yeah. Is there anyone else --
1 don't know what they're doing behind the scenes. I mean, you guys 
23 are --like, you're really asking a lot of questions about, like, how we're looking at what 
24 happened on January 6th, and it's --we're not trying --I'm not trying to pull the wool over 
25 anybody's eyes. I'm trying to be as helpful as I can here.  51 
1 No, we understand that. We're trying to understand certain things, 
2 and we're trying to --we're trying to understand certain things, but we're also trying to 
3 kind of, like, reconcile things that may or may not be consistent or inconsistent. And, to 
4 your point earlier, sometimes we think we understand it and somebody says, "Well, this 
5 process is different," or somebody says, "Well, you have the wrong person; you should 
6 really ask this." 
7 So I understand what you're saying. You introduced, a moment ago, the 
8 explanation that you asked them to do research, which is quite different than what we 
9 had earlier understood you to be saying, which was that they're an e-discovery company 
10 that reviews documents and is, I would say, reactive to requests, not necessarily proactive 
11 in doing research. 
12 And so what you just said was somewhat of a shift, and so we're trying to 
13 understand the information that you just provided versus what it sounded like you were 
14 saying earlier. 
15 Mr. Cannon. No, I think I provided that information prior to the break as well. 
16 did say they were doing some research. That's it. 
17 
18 Q BY 
Yeah. I think what -is referring to is that you seemed to suggest 
19 that the reason the FEC disclosures have "recount" and "research consulting" is because 
20 2M was doing research. And the information that we've received is that the reason why 
21 2M was paid millions of dollars by MAGA PAC was not because it was doing research; it 
22 was because it was doing very important e-discovery work, needed to process a lot of 
23 documents. 
24 
25 A 
Q That is correct. 
Okay. So -- 52 
Both of those things can be true at the same time. 1 
2 A 
Q Yeah. But we want to clarify, when you reference "research," any research 
3 would've been a minority, more marginal part of the work that 2M was doing for MAGA 
4 PAC. Is that fair? 
5 
6 
7 A 
Q I can't say on day to day. I don't know. 
BY 
Given what you just said about the work that you were asking them to do for 
8 research at the beginning, what was your understanding of the part of that that was 
9 recount-related? 
10 
11 A 
Q Because it all had to do with January 6th and the events of January 6th. 
And your understanding is that if something has to do with the events of 
12 January 6th it can be qualified as recount? 
13 A 
14 Correct. 
15 
16 
17 Q 
Q That is not inconsistent with my understanding from outside counsel. 
Okay. 
BY 
And, just to be clear, is it also your understanding that --was it consistent 
18 with your understanding from outside counsel that something that had to do with 
19 responding to the COVID committee could also be labeled as research --I mean, as 
20 recount-related? Is that also part of that same understanding? 
21 
22 A 
Q I don't recall discussing the COVID committee with outside counsel. 
I want to move to just understanding the different folks' role. In these 
23 matters we've been discussing with 2M, what was Justin Clark's role in all of this? 
24 
25 A 
Q I mean, he was counsel. 
I understand, but with regard to the work with 2M and the approval process,  53 
1 what was he doing? Was he assisting you in the same kind of capacity of overseeing --
2 A Yeah. We're colleagues. We work on everything --we work on stuff 
3 together. Not everything together. We work on stuff together though. 
4 BY 
5 Q Would you say that you have the primary responsibility on maintaining the 
6 relationship with Mr. Clark and 2M? 
7 A I don't know. I don't know how much he talks to --how much Justin talks 
8 to Matt Clarke. I talk to Matt Clarke fairly frequently. I don't know how often Justin 
9 speaks to him. 
10 Q I only asked because, a moment ago when I asked, I was trying to 
11 understand from your reaction --we're just trying to gauge, sometimes people have, like, 
12 a contact partner or a contact that they interact with. We were just trying to figure out, 
13 are you the relationship partner for 2M or do you both talk to him equally. We're just 
14 trying to understand who's the more frequent contact with 2M. 
15 
16 
17 A 
Q It's probably me. 
BY 
And Mr. Clark has been involved from, is it fair to say, the conversion of 
18 MAGA PAC to the present day with --he's still involved with MAGA PAC; is that right? 
19 
20 
21 
22 A 
Q I mean, through elections. 
Okay. 
What about Mr. Doi Iman? Is he still doing work with MAGA PAC? 
A I don't know Mr. Dallman --I mean, I think he's at Red Curve. I'm not sure 
23 what his employment relationship is right now. 
24 Q Did Mr. Kushner have any involvement, as far as you're aware, with the 
25 approval of expenses or expenditures from MAGA PAC?  1 
2 
3 
4 A 
Q 
A 
Q Probably during the --well, from MAGA PAC? So post-conversion? 
Yeah. 
No, I don't believe so. 
Any other members of the Trump family that you're aware of having any 
5 involvement post-conversion with MAGA PAC and its expenditures? 
6 
7 A 
Q No, not to my knowledge. 
Just quickly, Mr. Cannon, some of the documents you provided, they're 
8 just --you provided an extensive amount of documents, but there are some documents 
9 that seem to be missing, and I just want to get a sense from you whether there was a 
10 reason why they're missing or whether it was by chance. 
11 For example, there are letters that President Trump drafted to NARA regarding 54 
12 the January 6th Committee's productions, whether objections, things of that nature, but I 
13 don't believe we have any letters related to the COVID committee. Are you aware of 
14 President Trump drafting any letters to them? 
15 A No. I mean, this is all --no. Those letters were sent by Mr. Clark. They 
16 don't require --right now, the COVID committee is not requiring a formal assertion of 
17 executive privilege under the PRA. The letter from counsel is sufficient for them. 
18 
19 Q 
A Okay. That's helpful. 
And, I mean, it really is going to the Archivist, right? And then the Archivist 
20 consults with the Biden administration, and that's how a determination is made. 
21 
22 Q Yeah. 
If you could just give us a moment, Mr. Cannon. We're trying to be efficient here 
23 and see what else we have for you. 
24 
25 A 
Q That's okay. 
Mr. Cannon, we're nearing the end. I just want to give Mr. Aguilar, who's  1 with us --whether he has any questions or anything else he wants to put forward. 
2 
3 
4 Mr. Aguilar. I don't, guys. I'm good. Thank you. 
Okay. Thank you, sir. 
All right, Mr. Cannon, before we go, just one last question is with regard to your 55 
5 attorney's fees. Are you paying your own attorney's fees, or is that being paid by a third 
6 party? 
7 Mr. Cannon. I have not discussed my arrangement on attorney's fees with my 
8 counsel. 
9 
10 
11 - l'msorry? 
Mr. Benson. Mr. Cannon's fees are not being paid by anyone. 
Well, I don't think that's what he said. He said he hasn't 
12 discussed them with you, Mr. Benson. 
13 So, Mr. Cannon, I guess, when you say you haven't discussed them with your 
14 lawyer, the question would be more so, who is paying your attorney's fees? 
15 Mr. Cannon. No one's paying my attorney's fees. 
16 So is it fair to say that you're paying your own attorney's 
17 fees? 
18 Mr. Cannon. It is --Mr. Benson is undertaking this work on, I guess you could call 
19 it, a pro bona basis. 
20 - Oh, okay. 
21 Got it. 
23 what you were trying to say. 
24 Mr. Cannon. No, you're jumping me on something, and I've got my wonderful 
25 attorney here, and we have not had a discussion about that. I am -- 1 
2 Does he know he's doing it pro bona, or is it pro bona now? 
Mr. Cannon. That's the issue, right? And I'm absolutely serious about that. 
3 Like --that's all. 
4 Okay. 
Mr. Cannon. We have not had that --56 
5 
6 - No, I know. I've been at that dinner where you think they're paying, 
7 but then it's unclear, and then it's like the check hasn't come yet. So I totally get it. 
8 totally get it. 
9 
10 
11 Mr. Benson. Alex will have to take me out to dinner. Let's put it that way. 
Mr. Cannon. Okay. 
- And, to be clear, we ask this --well, we try to remember to ask this of 
12 all --this is not a specific --we ask this of all witnesses. It's not privileged information, 
13 who's paying your attorney's fees. So I don't want you to feel, you know, that this is 
14 something special to you. We try to ask everyone. So we just didn't ask you last time, 
15 and we noticed that after the fact, so that's why we were following up this time. 
16 So we would just ask that, to the extent that that changes and the answer is that 
17 Mr. Benson is no longer doing this pro bona, we do not want to have --if the information 
18 subsequently changes and we don't have another interview with you, we would just ask if 
19 you would voluntarily correct that. Because if for some reason it's a fact in the 
20 investigation that later for some reason becomes different, we would like you to have the 
21 opportunity to correct that if it changes, if that makes sense. 
22 
23 Mr. Cannon. No, I understand the request. 
24 All right, Mr. Cannon, we are done early, so we've got 
25 21 minutes.  57 
1 Any questions that you have for --no. 
2 You know, if you want to hang out, we're happy to stay on 
3 with you, Mr. Cannon, if you want to spend some time with us. 
4 Now that we know Dan's free, we'll keep you --
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 Yeah. We'll --
Mr. Benson. You guys can come to the dinner with me and Alex. 
Mr. Cannon. We'll do it in Atlanta,. You can visit your family. It'll be fun. 
All right. I mean, if Dan's paying, I'm calling bones. 
Mr. Cannon, thank you for taking out the time again. We 
10 know these are not great ways to spend one's afternoon, getting questioned, so we 
11 appreciate you for taking out the time. 
12 If at any time you want to correct anything or you remember something or you 
13 think that for any reason we should know something, please don't hesitate to reach out. 
14 We want to make sure we get this correct. So, please, if at any time you want us to 
15 know something, please reach out to Dan, and he can let us know. 
16 Otherwise, we will go off the record here. 
17 Thank you both. 
18 Thank you to our court reporters as well. 
19 
20 
21 
22 Mr. Cannon. Thank you. 
Mr. Benson. Thank you. 
Thank you both. Have a great day. 
[Whereupon, at 2:40 p.m., the interview was concluded.]  1
