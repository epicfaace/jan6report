You can't make this up. 
just got this voice message 
to Rudy Giuliani, who 
apparently thought he was 
calling Senator Tuberville. 
You've got to listen to that 
message. Rudy is walking 
malpractice. 
Please, Robert. Please 
remain in your current post 
until noon on JanuarY-20th. 
We need you there. 
Now more than ever .
