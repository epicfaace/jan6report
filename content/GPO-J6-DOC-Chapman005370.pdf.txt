John, very respectfully, I just don't in the end believe that there is a single Justice on the United States Supreme Court, or a 
single judge on any of our Courts of Appeals, who is as "broad minded" as you when it comes to the irrelevance of statutes 
enacted by the United States Congress, and followed without exception for more than 130 years. They cannot be set aside 
except when in direct conflict with the Constitution that our revered Framers handed us. And very respectfully, I don't think 
that a single one of those Framers would agree with your position either. Certainly, Judge Luttig has made clear he does 
not. And there is no reasonable argument that the Constitution directs or empowers the Vice President to set a procedure 
followed for 130 years before it has even been resorted to. 
Lincoln suspended the writ when the body entrusted with that authority was out of session, and submitted it to them as soon 
as it returned. I understand your argument that several state legislatures were out of session. But the role for state 
legislatures has for our entire history ended at the time that electoral certificates are submitted to Congress. Congress has 
debated submissions, including competing submissions. It has never once referred them out to state legislatures to decide. 
I respect your heart here. I share your concerns about what Democrats will do once in power. I want election integrity fixed. 
But I have run down every legal trail placed before me to its conclusion, and I respectfully conclude that as a legal 
framework, it is a results oriented position that you would never support if attempted by the opposition, and essentially 
entirely made up. 
And thanks to your bullshit, we are now under siege.

I'm sorry Greg, but this is small minded. You're sticking with minor procedural statutes while the Constitution is 
being shredded. I gave you the Lincoln example yesterday. Here's another. In the situation room at the White 
House during the first Iraq war, the Sec of Interior said the law required an environmental impact assessment 
before the President could order bombing of the Iraq oil fields. Technically true. But nonsense. Luckily, Bush got 
statesmanship advice and ignored that statutory requirement.

Thanks, John. Will call. 
Is it unconstitutional for the ECA to direct that the members should do objections, at least in the first 
instance? Would the constitutional imperative you argue for not kick in only after that statutorily 
required mechanism has been applied, and failed to uphold the Constitution?

Greg, 
Good talk earlier tonight. 
Major new development attached. This is huge, as it now looks like PA Legislature will 
vote to recertify its electors if Vice President Pence implements the plan we discussed. 
Chapman005370  Give me a call once you've had your sit-down with the VP and let me know where we 
stand. 
Again, thank you.
