Re: FBI WFO Update for January 6th Events 
-and I were talking this morning and hoping you can give us some direction for the sit reps. As you are 
both aware during the last event we were inundated with requests from both external partners and internal 
FBI entities asking to be included on the sit rep distro, seeing as this event is gaining alot of attention from the 
USIC, what is our posture for including outside WFO entities in the sit rep distro? 
Also FYI on social media -hop-efully everyone i-s aware that he social media tool contract elipired on NYE and 
was awarded to a new company who utilizes trre tool called Zerofox. So far we've been able to get accounts 
and currently working with the PMs at HQ_ to get key word searches going on the tool. All this to say, our social 
media abilities might be slightly degraded during thi.s events as we are getting use to this new tool but we're 
gonna make-it work @ 
Thanks, -
-and-this is a great roll-up and offers a host of good info from which the ADIC may select to help give FBI 
EM a good optic into the Jan 6 landscape . Please extend my thanks to the JTTF and Intel folks who worked on this last 
night and this morning. 
Adding the other SACs for visibility. 
Boss, the mini-C/P effort on Jan 6 will operate out of the_ , starting sometime during the day (TBD} and running 
into the evening. Let us know if you have follow-up questions or need anything additional.

Freedom Plaza: Cindy Chafia'n, permit holder 1300 • 2000hrs. 5000+ on NPS permit application (will not get) 
(analysis: This is a group that has splintered from the original Woman For America First (MAGA) group. She will not get 
the numbers she wants and this event will be smaller and less well attended . Its' time (after dark) will have possible 
consequences for violence as we have seen the past two months).

3. (U//LES) As of January 2021, the participants of the 'Stop 
the Steal' protest on 6 January 2021 in Washington, District of 
Columbia, established the QRF in the Rosslyn, Virginia, area. An 
identified USPER, who led the identified Virginia militia group, 
communicated that people should bring mace, flash lights, body 
armor, and head protection. Members of the protest believed Rosslyn 
to be a safe area for them. (FBI comment. The 'Stop the Steal' 
protest was likely the protest against the Electoral College 
certification.) Participants were aware of the prohibition on 
firearms in Washington, District of Columbia, so they planned to 
establish an armed presence outside the city to respond to 'calls 
for help'.
