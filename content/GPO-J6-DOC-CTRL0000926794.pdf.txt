• As you all know, January 6th is the date for Congress to certify the Electoral 
College and the Biden election 
o There have been numerous calls for protests 
o POTUS has energized the support 
• It is our analytic assessment that the online communications around this 
event have been focusing on increased tensions and there is greater negative 
sentiment motivating conversation than the last two events in November and 
December 2020 that brought groups contesting the outcome of the 
Presidential Election. 
o Protestors believe that they can influence Congress and change the 
outcome of the Electoral College 
o Our greatest concern is: Some groups have expressed intent to come 
armed on social media, and law enforcement entities have confirmed 
previous seizures and arrests of individuals attempting to violate DC 's 
"no firearms" laws 
o We have seen an increase in violent rhetoric, to include: 
■ Calls for individuals to be prepared for battle 
■ Encouraging guns and weapons to be brought to the District 
• Travel in tight groups to avoid being "picked off' by 
police 
• Exercise their 2A rights 
■ Militia calls to come to the district 
• WV Three04 Militias 
• Proud American Patriots Network 
• Oath Keepers 
• III¾ers 
■ White Supremacist 
• Vorherrschaft Division 
• Stormfront 
■ Threat actors who have a history of violence in the District are 
planning to adjust their tactics in order to gain access to the 
opposition 
• For those who have received briefings from us before, 
our LEs are very sophisticated and keep counter 
protesters apart 
■ Calls to use Covid as a weapon have come up again 
• Hypervigilant about spread of Covid 
o In addition to general demonstrators and encouraging violent  opportunities, Others are calling to "peacefully" storm the Capitol and 
occupy the building to halt the vote 
■ Not sure what "peaceful" means, but they are calling to occupy 
the building 
• All of this is centered around the "rigged election" theory 
o OSINT has confirmed support for the "rigged election" theory being 
advanced by groups who do not normally associate with each other, 
which may indicate an increased number of potential attendees to 
Wednesday's demonstrations 
■ Accelerationists and pro-Administration supporters 
■ Neo-nazis and Militia groups 
■ The coalition of these random groups might be an impetus for 
violence 
• Supporters of the rigged election theory are coming into the District, starting 
yesterday, to protest the joint session of Congress on January 6. 
• Updates on Permits 
o 3 known 
o Women for American First 
■ Splintering 
o The locations are: 
■ US Capitol 
■ Freedom Plaza 
■ The Ellipse (POTUS plans an entrance) 
• Due to the convergence of many diverse groups, and their intent to bring 
weapons to demonstrations, we assess there is likely to be violence on 
January 5 and 6. 
■ In the District, we are used to disciplined protesters, we're 
less familiar with these fringe groups with criminal intent. 
■ Do the centers on this call have knowledge of or concerns with 
■ threat actors or threat groups coming to the District? 
• History of protesting in these states that devolve into 
violence? 
• Are you concerned about these groups calling to bring 
guns to the District? 
o Or are they just "good-ol' -boys coming with guns? 
• QUESTIONS?
