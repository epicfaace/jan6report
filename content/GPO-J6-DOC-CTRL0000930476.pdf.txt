Hey-
Can we get the email Mary McCord sent to the FBI below uploaded to Relativity? I guess it would be a Mary McCord

Good morning, Brian, 
Sharing this in case you haven't seen it. 
Best, 
Mary 
There has been a noticeable tone shift among participants in the Oath Keepers chat room. Many are frustrated at the 
political situation they are facing and the lack of organizing. 
Top Points 
• User says that "fucking bullets" are the only way to achieve their goals 
• Same user says they are ready to die for the cause as "sacrificial lamb" and calls on others to join him  • Different user calls for getting teams together in Oregon
