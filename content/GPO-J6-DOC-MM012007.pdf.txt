Just talked to POTUS. He may call the Chairman of the Maricopa Board of Supervisors 
(BOS). Want to be sure he is briefed on what to discuss. 
1. BOS has full authority (and obligation) to ensure integrity of the election in 
Maricopa County. Because state law is being ignored in Maricopa as they are unable to 
verify/hand audit by precinct (as required by law), a hand count audit of all votes 
cast in voting centers is necessary. 
2. The BOS can ask for increased hand counting before certifying the election. 
3. There are potential issues with Dominion systems that MUST be adjudicated before 
certification should ever be considered by BOS. 
Call me with any questions you might have. Thx!
