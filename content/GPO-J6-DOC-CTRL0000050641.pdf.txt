OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT 
Information Memorandum 
TO: VICE PRESIDENT PENCE 
FROM: OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT, LEGAL 
SUBJECT: UNLAWFUL ELECTION CONDUCT IN SIX STATES 
DATE: JANUARY 1, 2021 
In six swing states-Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada, and 
Wisconsin-the GOP and related plaintiffs have alleged both (1) procedural 
violations of election laws by state or local election officials, and (2) substantive 
instances of election fraud. This memorandum provides state-by-state charts that 
summarize these allegations. 
In general, there is strong evidence that state and local election officials committed 
numerous procedural violations that reduced transparency and/or favored Democrat 
candidates. However, most allegations of substantive voter fraud-defined to mean 
the casting of illegal ballots in violation of prevailing election laws-are either 
relatively small in number, or cannot be verified.

Errors with Duplicate Ballots: 
When original ballots could not be 
read by electronic ballot scanners, 
elections officials created duplicate 
ballots and then scanned those. In 
some instances, the officials 
erroneously filled out the duplicate 
ballots. A small number of these 
errors were later verified in court 
by comparing them to the original 
ballots, which officials retained. 
Statistics-based Allegations: 
Statistical experts identified 
numbers suggestive of the 
possibility of voter fraud, but these 
numbers cannot be verified. 
Allegation 
Limited Access for Observers/Poll 
Watchers: On December 7th, a trial court ordered a sample of 100 
duplicate ballots.2 Of the initial sample of 100, two were found 
to have been miscounted to President Trump's prejudice, and 
none to former Vice President Biden's prejudice (with one vote 
being erroneously "flipped" from Trump to Biden, and the other 
Trump ballot simply uncounted). This was a 2% error. On 
December 9th, the county agreed to sample an additional 2,500 
duplicate ballots, and 1,525 were sampled that same day. Of 
the 1,525 ballots that were sampled that day, seven were found 
to have been erroneously counted-with five to the prejudice of 
Trump, and two to the prejudice of Biden. This brought the 
total rate of error among duplicate ballots to just over half a 
percentile (0.5%), which is material, given that the candidates' 
total statewide vote counts were less than half a percentile 
apart (0.8%). There were not enough total duplicate ballots in 
the state, however, to affect the outcome of the election. 
Experts testified that, among other things, 86,845 ballots 
mailed to voters were never returned to the state, 219, 1:35 mail­
in votes were recorded by voters who never requested mail-in 
ballots, and 5,790 ballots were cast by individuals who later 
moved out of the state.3 The official count shows that Biden 
received 10,457 more votes than President Trump, making 
these numbers material. Specific instances of illegal votes, 
however, cannot be verified at this time. 
Georgia 
Description 
On Election Night at State Farm Arena, election observers, the 
media, and most election workers left after being told that 
counting was completed for the night. Video footage, however, 
shows some election workers actually stayed on the premises 
for several hours and continued to count ballots largely 
unobserved.4 Initial reports that the counted ballots were 
taken from suitcases have been refuted by state officials. 
Some GOP poll watchers also testified to being intimidated by 
people working with Democrat-affiliated groups. 5

Failure to Investigate Potential 
Fraud and Abuse in a Timely 
Manner: 
Questionable Signature Matching 
Standards: Although both Republicans and Democrats alleged election 
improprieties during early voting, the Secretary of State did not 
announce an investigation for weeks and then when he did, he 
announced that the results of the investigation would not 
change the results of the election before concluding the 
investigation.6 
Similarly, although many people,7 have alleged issues with 
signature matching on absentee ballots since Election Day, the 
Secretary of State chose not to announce an audit on signatures 
until about six weeks after Election Day. This date fell on the 
date that the Electoral College was to vote.8 
In Georgia, signature match is the principal way that election 
officials verify that absentee ballots are cast by the voters who 
requested them. Some have argued that a consent order the 
Georgia Secretary of State entered into in early 2020 impacted 
the state's signature matching standards.9 However, a recently 
completed audit of over 15,000 mail-in ballots that were cast in 
Cobb County, jointly conducted by the Secretary of State and 
Georgia Bureau of Investigation, found that only ten absentee 
ballots had signature mismatches that required further direct 
follow-up with the voter. Upon further investigation, eight of 
the ten voters whose signatures appeared to be mismatches told 
investigators that the signatures on the baUots were their own. 
In the remaining two cases, one voter signed in the incorrect 
spot, and the other voter's wife mistakenly signed her 
husband's ballot envelope.10

Election Night Errors Uncovered by 
Recounts: 
Trump Campaign's Numerical 
Allegations: Floyd County found roughly 2,600 votes during the recount that 
were not scanned due to human error. The Secretary of State's 
office immediately called for the resignation of a local county 
official.11 During the recount, three other counties discovered a 
total of more than 3,300 uncounted votes on memory cards.12 
Combined, these uncounted votes added a net 1,400 votes to the 
Trump/Pence total. When the Secretary of State was 
confronted with errors in the election system, he chose to 
minimize and deflect blame. 
The Trump Campaign has made the following numerical 
allegations, which OVP has not been able to verify: 13 
• As many as 2,560 felons with an uncompleted sentence 
were allowed to register and vote in the election. 
• At least 66,247 underage people were allowed to register 
and subsequently illegally vote. 
• At least 2,423 individuals were allowed to vote who were 
not listed in the State's records as having been. 
• At least 4,926 individuals were allowed to vote in Georgia 
who were registered to vote in another stat. 
• At least 395 individuals were allowed to vote in Georgia 
who also cast ballots in another state. 
• At least 15,700 individuals were allowed to vote in Georgia 
who filed a national change of address with the Postal 
Service prior to November 3, 2020. 
• At least 40,279 individuals were allowed to vote in Georgia 
who had moved across county lines at least 30 days prior to 
Election Day and who had failed to properly re-register to 
vote in their new county after moving. 
• At least 1,043 individuals were allowed to vote who had 
illegally registered to vote using a postal office box. 
• At least 98 individuals were allowed to vote who registered 
after the last day permitted under law. 
• At least 2,664 absentee ballots were mailed to individuals 
prior to the earliest day permitted by law. 
• At least 217 individuals were allowed to vote whose 
absentee ballots, according to state records, were applied 
for, issued, and received all on the same day. 
• As many as 10,315 or more individuals were allowed to vote 
who were deceased by the time of Election Day.

Allegation 
Limited Access for Observers/Poll 
Watchers: Detroit officials kicked 
out some Trump campaign 
observers, and further blocked 
visibility through windows by 
putting up paper. 
Processing Invalid BaHots: In 
affidavits, a handful of GOP 
observers and one election worker 
whistleblower allege that election 
workers were instructed to count 
numerous improperly cast ballots.15 
Statistics-based Allegations: 
Statistical experts identified 
numbers suggestive of the 
possibility of voter fraud, but these 
numbers cannot be verified.16 Michigan 
Description 
During the counting of ballots, Detroit officials removed some 
Trump campaign observers from the TCF Center, and denied 
entry to others.14 USA Today's reporting indicates, however, 
that the GOP and Democrats were both allowed to have 184 
observers in the room, one per table for counting absentee 
ballots. Paper was in fact taped up to block the windows, 
supposedly because election workers felt intimidated by the 
excluded GOP challengers taking videos through the window. 
According to a few sworn but otherwise unverified affidavits, 
Detroit election workers (1) coached voters to vote for the 
Democrat party and then watched them vote, (2) backdated 
absentee baHots, (3) accepted mail-in ballots that were mailed 
in under names that did not match any name on the voter rolls 
by assigning them to other people with the same last names but 
who had not voted, ( 4) allowed people to vote in person who had 
previously applied for an absentee ballot but did not turn the 
absentee baHot in, and (5) made observers stand six feet away 
from the counting process, where they could not clearly see the 
ballots or the poll books. 
Experts analyzed a sample of data and found 12.23% of voters 
who voted by absentee ballot never requested an absentee 
ballot at the clerk's office, as required by law. The experts 
extrapolated and determined that between 326,460 and 531,467 
of the total absentee ballots were not requested by an eligible 
voter. The experts also allege that at least 18,248 absentee or 
early voters were not residents of Michigan when they voted, 
and that 317 of them voted in more than one state. 259 
absentee ballots further illegally listed their home address as 
" email."

Allegation 
Illegal Use of Signature

County Election Department 
illegally used a machine to verify 
30% of signatures, even though law 
requires an employee to check the 
signatures.17 
Voter Fraud: When a voter showed

was told that she had already voted 
by mail-even though she had 
not.19

Description 
AB4 requires "the clerk or an employee in the office of the 
county clerk shall check the signature used for the mail ballot 
in accordance with" detailed procedures.18 Those procedures do 
not include relying on artificial intelligence software to verify 
matching signatures. Moreover, neither the Election Ordinance 
of Clark County, nor the Nevada State Constitution, make any 
provision for the electronic verification of signatures. Clark 
County is the only county in Nevada that uses the Agilis system 
and the only county in Nevada that does not verify signatures 
on absentee and mail in ballots in person. 
The voter believes that it was Clark County's use of Agilis 
signature-verification software that allowed her mail-in ballot, 
which she had not signed or mailed, to be accepted and counted 
in the Election. 
The Nevada Republican Party and the President's campaign 
allege that observers were restricted from entering some areas 
where ballots were being handled and reviewed. 
Data analysis showed that up to 42,284 Nevada voters returned 
more than one ballot. It also showed that almost 23,000 ballots 
were mailed to voters with either non-Nevada addresses or to 
individuals who had changed their address to a state outside of 
Nevada within 30 days-therefore not meeting the residency 
requirement to be eligible to vote. And potentially 1,506 voters 
who were listed as deceased may have cast ballots.

Secretary of the Commonwealth 
colluded with Democrat plaintiffs to 
eviscerate election protections. 
Processing Invalid Ballots: 
Democrat-majority counties voted 
to count illegal votes, and the 
Pennsylvania Supreme Court 
allowed it. 
Lack of Observers: Some Democrat 
counties refused to allow 
Republicans to observe the the Secretary illegally permitted unsecure drop boxes at 
locations other than the county boards of elections. The left­
leaning Pennsylvania Supreme Court upheld that change.22 
Second, the Secretary removed signature verification 
requirements and secrecy envelop requirements for mail-in 
ballots. The left-leaning Pennsylvania Supreme Court upheld 
the signature verification change, but found the change to the 
secrecy envelop rule contrary to law.23 Last, the Secretary tried 
to extend the deadline for voters to resolve proof of 
identification issues with their mail-in and absentee ballots, a 
move that was enjoined bv a state court.24 
Pennsylvania law prohibits counting mail-in ballots unless the 
envelope is properly filled out, dated, and signed, but election 
boards in Democrat-majority counties like Philadelphia and 
Allegheny voted to count ballots that did not meet these 
requirements,25 and further set up unlawful procedures for 
curing defective ballots.26 
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ultimately decided to count 
2,849 signed but undated mail-in ballots, even though the Court 
acknowledged they were invahd.27 The Court concluded that 
because the disputed ballots were received by 8:00 pm on 
Election Day, there was no danger that they were untimely or 
fraudulent. Therefore, according to the Court, they should be 
counted, even though they were technically invalid. 
A court eventually ordered on November 5 that all candidates, 
watchers, and candidate representatives be permitted to be

Democrat election officials in Montgomery County notified 
when their ballots were defective so they could cure them, even 
though they had no statutory authority to do so. Law-abiding 
Republican counties did not extend the same (unlawful) 
opportunity to Republicans. In addition, the office of the 
Secretary of the Commonwealth issued guidance right before 
Election Day stating that voters with defective mail-in ballots 
could be issued provisional ballots, despite a legal requirement 
that the voter must swear that the provisional ballot is the only 
ballot cast. The Democrat party then targeted its voters with 
printed handbills informing them of this invented right to re-
vote.29

both Dane and Milwaukee Counties, the Canvassing Boards 
found that the Clerk's receipt of form EL-122 (the "Envelope" in 
which the absentee ballot is placed by the voter after it has 
already been received by the voter and after it has been 
completed) was sufficient to satisfy the statutory written 
application requirement.33

Illegal Correcting of Ballots 
34 fd. 
35 Id. Wisconsin Statute § 6.87(6d) requires absentee ballots with a 
certificate missing the address of a witness not be counted. 
Municipal clerks in Milwaukee County and Dane County 
illegally added missing witness information to ballot 
certifications. In accordance with Wisconsin Statute§ 6.84(2), 
absentee ballots accompanied by incomplete certifications or 
those ballots which municipal clerks in Milwaukee County and 
Dane County added missing information are illegal and 
invahd.35 
In March 2020 the Dane County Clerk and Milwaukee County 
Clerk concluded that during the COVID-19 emergency and 
based upon the Governor's Stay at Home order, all voters 
within the county could declare themselves "indefinitely 
confined" due to illness for purposes of obtaining an absentee 
ballot. This designation further allowed voters claiming it to 
circumvent the state's photo ID requirements. 
On March 31, 2020, the Wisconsin Supreme Court granted the 
GOP's request for preliminary injunctive relief, concluding that 
the Dane County Clerk could not direct voters that anyone 
could request an absentee ballot as indefinitely confined due to 
the pandemic and governor's stay-at-home order. The Court 
concluded that under Wisconsin law declaring oneself 
indefinitely confided or disabled for an indefinite period is an 
individual determination that only an individual elector can 
make and that determination may be based only upon age, 
physical illness, or infirmity, and that the mere presence in the 
community of a communicable disease, such as COVID-19, does 
not itself entitle all electors in Wisconsin to obtain an absentee 
ballot. 
A woman was charged with election fraud after a police 
investigation found that she submitted an absentee ballot for 
her deceased spouse. Investigators said the suspect not only 
confessed, she also listed herself as the voter's witness on the 
ballot envelope.36 The attempted fraud was caught, and the 
ballot was not counted. 
Clerks corrected or cured missing witness address information 
on mail-in envelopes, which Republicans contend violated a 
state law stating that "[i]f a certificate is missing the address of 
a witness, the ballot may not be counted."37 The guidance 
permitting the address correction procedure had been in place
