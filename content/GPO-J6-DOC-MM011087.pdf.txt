HERE' s an AGRESSIVE STRl\TEGY: 
Why can't the states of GA NC PENN and other R controlled state houses declare this is 
BS (where conflicts and election not called that night) and just send their own 
electors to vote and have it go to the SCOTUS. SCOTUS understands that the state 
legislature is the will of the people and rule that the electors are legal. Done! 
Federalist theory. 
think. Precedent in history. It's how Lincoln got into the presidency I 
Lesson learned by states is that if you don't control your state and not have all this 
crooked shit and delays in voting etc .... then this is the way the votes will go. As 
approved by SCOTUS 
I wonder if POTUS knows this about the electors. 
It could lead to some interesting horse trading as well.
