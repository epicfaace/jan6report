[; 1 /6 Speaker Schedule 
Hey guys, I spent the better part of the day on the phone with these organizers, and 
was able to get a little guidance from the White House. 
1 The green marks are those who are already confirmed speaking on the 5th. 
2. The red marks are suggested to move to the 5th and/or SCOTUS. 
3. The yellow marks either don't pass vetting or there may be an issue to explore. 
4. POTUS expectations are to have something intimate at the ellipse, and call on 
everyone to march to the capitol. This actually works out, because Ali's group is 
already setting up at the Capitol, and SCOTUS is on the way. 
5. I think we should secure a SCOTUS stage and have the higher profile, more 
serious policy speakers, who are not speaking on the 5th, speak there right after 
POTUS on the way to the Capitol. 
I'm happy to put together a suggested lineup with additional elected officials and 
confirm with the 5th folks. Cindy and I are in a good place, so I think we can get it 
cleared up by tomorrow. 
Thoughts?
