PENCE CAN LET THE STATES DECIDE 
• The VP doesn't need to declare Trump the winner, or to reject ALL the 
ballots of a disputed state ... 
• There is a middle path that is a way out for everybody 
• On January 6th, the VP could only accept HALF the electoral votes from 
the disputed states, instead of all. The justification being this mirrors the 
popular vote of the state so no one is disenfranchised 1 
• Pence then explains that given the serious evidence of fraud, Winner­
Takes-All would not be appropriate for the remaining half 
• Accordingly, Pence announces he is not rejecting them, but giving state 
legt:u~ latures 10 days to confirm them

forfeit half their electoral votes 
• During those 10 days, we would build public support 
• The state legislatures will have cover because even if they award half to 
Trump, or do nothing, no one hits 270 so it goes to the House2 
• The House of Representatives has decided Presidential Elections before, 
there is precedent3 
1 Due to the Electoral College Act, ce11ain procedural steps may be necessary to execute, but they are attainable 
2 The Disputed States are Wl ( I 0) Ml ( 16) PA (20) GA ( 16) AZ ( I I) V (6)

Washington is being inundated with people who 
don't want to see an eleiction victory stolen by 
emboldened radical left democrats. Our country has 
had enough, they won't take it anymore! We hear 
you (and love you) from the Oval Office! 
I hope the rJ)emocrats, and even more importantly, 
the weak and ineffective RINO section of the 
Republican Party, are looking at the thousands of 
people pouring into the city. They won't stand for a 
landslide election victory to be stolen.
