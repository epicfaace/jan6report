2 - This is a deposition of Alex Jones conducted by the House Select 
3 Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol pursuant to 
4 House Resolution 503. 
5 This deposition is being conducted remotely through the Webex platform. 
6 This will be a staff-led deposition, though members may choose to ask questions 
7 as they so desire. We're currently joined by Mrs. Murphy. 
8 As we may be joined by other folks, I'll ask that,_ you just let me know as 
9 people pop in, in case I miss anyone.

17 My name is 
Joining us remotely are 
investigative counsel; I'm an investigative counsel with the select committee. 
senior investigative counsel; -
investigative counsel. We're also joined by 
who is the chief technical officer, and_, our 
parliamentarian, as well as from the professional staff. 
We will be holding the House deposition --we will be holding this deposition 
under the House rules that we previously provided to Mr. Jones' counsel. 
Under those rules, Mr. Jones, you're permitted to have your attorney present. 
18 I'll note for the record that your attorney is here. I'll have him identify himself in a 
19 moment. 
20 But counsel for other persons or other government agencies may not attend. In 
21 other words, the only lawyers who are present today are those from the select 
22 committee and your counsel. 
23 At this time, I'd ask that Mr. Jones' counsel please state their name for the record. 
24 Mr. Pattis. Hi. My name is Norm Pattis, P-a-t-t-i-s. I'm joining remotely from 
25 Connecticut.  4 
1 - Thank you. 
2 Under the House deposition rules, neither committee members nor staff may 
3 discuss the substance of the testimony provided today unless the committee approves its 
4 release. 
5 Mr. Jones, you and your attorney will have an opportunity to review the 
6 transcript. 
7 Before we get started, I'd like to just cover a few ground rules for today's 
8 deposition. 
9 As you heard me mention before we went on the record, we do have an official 
10 reporter who's transcribing our conversation and has joined us via Webex. The 
11 deposition is also being recorded, but the reporter's transcription is the official record of 
12 the proceeding. 
13 Mr. Jones, please wait to answer each question until it's completed, and I will do 
14 my best to wait to ask a question until you respond. It's particularly important that we 
15 avoid the crosstalk while we're proceeding remotely via Webex. 
16 The reporter cannot note nonverbal responses, such as shaking or nodding a head, 
17 so it's important that you respond to each question with an audible verbal response. 
18 For the benefit of the reporter and the record, there may be times when I have to 
19 clarify what you've said, including spellings or the name of an individual you mention. 
20 We ask that you give complete answers to the best of your recollection. If a 
21 question is unclear, please just ask for clarification. If you don't know the answer, just 
22 say so. 
23 Logistically, if you need to take any breaks or would like to discuss anything with 
24 your attorney privately, we're happy to accommodate and take breaks as best we can. 
25 Throughout the deposition I'll be directing you to review some exhibits that we've  5 
1 marked for today. They'll be shown to you on the screen in front of you. And when 
2 we refer to a document you can take your time to familiarize yourself with it before we 
3 discuss. 
4 So, for example, if we can start --we're not starting the deposition yet, but I'd like 
5 to just pull up exhibit 1, if we could. 
6 Do we have it up? Can you see that document? 
7 Mr. Pattis. - I don't know if you're just going through boilerplate 
8 instructions here, but I've informed your colleagues that Mr. Jones will be asserting his 
9 Fifth Amendment privilege as to every question but for asking him to identify himself. 
10 So, you know, Mr. Jones, you can answer consistent with my instructions. 
11 Well, then, in that case, let's just --let me get through some of my 
12 other preparatory instructions here and then I'll just cover this after that, if that seems 
13 like a more efficient way to do it. 
14 Mr. Jones, you may refuse to answer a question only to preserve a privilege that's 
15 recognized by the select committee. If you refuse to answer a question that's based on 
16 a privilege, we can either proceed with the deposition or we can seek a ruling from the 
17 chairman on the objection. If the chairman overrules your objection, then you're 
18 required to answer the question. 
19 My goal today is to ask questions that are relevant to the select committee's 
20 investigation with the hope that you will answer. And if you have an objection or a 
21 privilege assertion, we'll ask you to assert that for the record. 
22 I understand, as your counsel just mentioned, that you intend to invoke the Fifth 
23 Amendment in response to our questions. 
24 Be that as it may, I will say that our goal is to understand the basis for the 
25 objection and fairly evaluate it. Ultimately, to the extent you're able, the detail you can  6 
1 provide about the objection makes it easier for the select committee to understand it. 
2 Finally, I want --
3 Mr. Pattis. I'm sorry. I cut you off,_ I apologize. 
4 I just want to say, this is the last sort of instruction and it's one that 
5 we give to all witnesses, Mr. Jones, so it's not specific to you. 
6 We remind all witnesses that it's unlawful to deliberately provide false 
7 information to Congress, and providing false information could result in criminal penalties 
8 under Title 18 of the United States Code, section 1001. 
9 Do you understand the information I've covered so far or do you have any 
10 questions? 
11 Mr. Pattis. I'm instructing Mr. Jones to assert his privilege. 
12 the basis for his privilege is, as I evaluate it, and it's on my advice that 
13 he's giving it, is as follows. 
14 There appears to be a very broad and wide-sweeping --an increasingly broad and 
15 wide-sweeping investigation by a parallel branch of government in the Justice 
16 Department, and any answers that Mr. Jones might give as to his attendance, 
17 involvement, planning, preparation, or other knowledge of events that took place on 
18 January 6th could tend to inculpate him in the view of a prosecutor in a coordinate 
19 branch of government. 
20 And so on that basis, with all due respect to the committee and its plenary 
21 powers, Mr. Jones intends to assert a simple Fifth Amendment privilege as to each 
22 question other than his name. 
23 - I appreciate that, Norm. And so, obviously, I think, as you know 
24 from our discussions prior to the deposition, our view is that Mr. Jones does need to 
25 assert that objection on a question-by-question basis, obviously because neither you nor  7 
1 he would know what questions we might ask. But I understand the position you have. 
2 Mr. Pattis. I only asserted that because you were asking it to him, and I don't 
3 want to appear to be rude here, and I'm answering on his behalf. That's the only 
4 reason. And I understand my role is limited here, so that may be the last you hear of me 
5 today depending on how it goes. Okay? 
6 I understand. Thanks for that. 
7 
8 Let's go ahead and place the witness under oath. 
The Reporter. Will you raise your right hand for me, please? 
9 Do you solemnly declare and affirm under the penalty of perjury that the 
10 testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the 
11 truth? 
12 
13 
14

EXAMINATION 
BY 
Q Mr. Jones, could you please state your full legal name for the record? 
A Alexander Emerick Jones. 
Q And I believe your first and last name are spelled in the traditional way. 
18 Could you please spell your middle name for the record? 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A You guys know what my name is. It's on the record. 
I'm just asking for the court reporter. 
E-m --I'm so stressed out, I can't even spell it for you, so --
Mr. Pattis. E-m-e-r-i-c. [SIC] 
The Witness. That's right, E-m-i-r-c. [SIC] 
BY 
Q Okay. Mr. Jones, you understand that you are here today pursuant to the  8 
1 subpoena issued by the select committee? 
2 A On advice of my counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
3 silent. 
4 Q Well, Mr. Jones, having reviewed several statements that you've made over 
5 the last year since January 6th, 2021, I understand your position to be that you do not 
6 think that you did anything in relation to the events of that day that would expose you to 
7 criminal prosecution. Is that a fair characterization of how you view your own conduct? 
8 
9 silent. 
10 
11 A On advice of my counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
Q If we could go ahead and pull up exhibit 2. 
Before we play it, Mr. Jones, I'll tell you, this is a video clip from "The Alex Jones 
12 Show" that was posted to Banned.Video on December 18th, 2021. For the record, the 
13 title is, quote, "Emergency Saturday Broadcast. Roger Stone Responds to Jan 6 
14 Interrogation," close quote. 
15 And for context, in this clip you're discussing Mr. Stone's deposition in front of the 
16 select committee, and you're making your own statements about your reaction to having 
17 been subpoenaed. 
18 At the very start of this clip you're referring to someone as "he." Having 
19 watched this clip, the "he" that you're mentioning is your lawyer, Mr. Pattis. 
20 If we could go ahead and play the clip for the witness. 
21 [Video shown.] 
22 At one point in this clip, Mr. Jones, you describe documents that 
23 were called for by the select committee's subpoena as, quote, "exculpatory," close quote. 
24 And you also say, quote, "I wasn't part of that," close quote, referring to the people who 
25 went into the Capitol. And you also say something to the effect of being wary of being  9 
1 led into what you refer to as a perjury trap. 
2 I raise this clip to you at the beginning of our conversation today to illustrate a 
3 point, which is that the Fifth Amendment protects your right to refuse to answer 
4 questions if the truth would, in fact, be incriminating. 
5 In other words, invoking the Fifth Amendment means that you have a good-faith 
6 belief that if you were forced to tell the truth, you would be testifying in a manner that 
7 you believe could be used against you in criminal prosecution. 
8 
9 Do you understand that? 
Mr. Pattis. Well, I'm going to object to that characterization of the Fifth. The 
10 law is that it tends to incriminate, whether --and so I'll object to that characterization of 
11 it for the sake of the record. Whether it's truthful or not in his mind is not the question. 
12 It's whether it would tend to incriminate in the eyes of a prosecuting authority. 
13 Having said that, Mr. Jones? 
14 The Witness. On advice of my counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right 
15 to remain silent. 
16 BY 
17 Q Well, I think that the larger point is that we want to ensure that you 
18 understand that, from having reviewed these materials, we are of the understanding that 
19 it is your view that the information does not incriminate you. Is that right? 
20 A On advice of my counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
21 silent. 
22 Q And you also, because you mentioned the term "perjury" in that clip, I want 
23 to make sure that you understand that the crime of perjury necessarily requires the 
24 witness to tell a lie. Do you understand that? 
25 A On advice of my counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain  10 
1 silent. 
2 Q Well, Mr. Jones, I just want to make sure you understand that all we want is 
3 the truth, which by our understanding of the statements you have made is not, in fact, 
4 incriminating against you in your own view. And so --
5 A We've offered you all the emails and all the text messages. You didn't want 
6 it. 
7 Mr. Pattis. Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones. 
8 BY 
9 Q Mr. Jones, I just want to make sure that, for purposes of the record today, 
10 that --whether your view is that the information in your possession is exculpatory. Do 
11 you think that the information is exculpatory? 
12 A On advice of my counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
13 silent. 
14 Q Well, we'll note your position for the record. 
15 For purposes of making sure that the subpoena is part of the record, I'll pull 
16 up --I'd ask Jacob to pull up exhibit 1. 
17 Mr. Jones, I'll represent to you that this is the subpoena issued by the select 
18 committee on November 22nd, 2021, that compelled the production of documents and 
19 your appearance for this deposition. 
20 On page 7 of this exhibit, there is a schedule that notes documents and 
21 communications that should have been produced, including documents related to topics 
22 within the scope of the select committee's investigation, including regarding several 
23 rallies held in Washington, D.C., on January 5th and 6th, 2021, their funding, security, and 
24 organizing. 
25 Mr. Jones, do you understand that the subpoena required the production of  11 
1 documents? 
2 A On advice of my counsel, I am asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
3 silent. 
4 Q And for the record, through your counsel, you've indicated that you will not 
5 provide any documents to the select committee based on an assertion of your right 
6 against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment. Is that correct? 
7 A On advice of my counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment rights to remain 
8 silent. 
9 Mr. Pattis. I have so made that representation, -in a communication 
10 wit~ 
11 
12 
13 - Thankyou. 
BY 
Q In the clip that we just watched from exhibit 2, Mr. Jones, you indicated that 
14 you reviewed documents in response to the subpoena. Is that correct? 
15 A On advice of my counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
16 silent. 
17 Q Is it your position that even just telling us whether you have text messages, 
18 emails, or other kinds of communications implicates your Fifth Amendment right against 
19 self-incrimination? 
20 A On advice of my counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
21 silent. 
22 Q I'll move on to asking about some events following the 2020 Presidential 
23 election. 
24 Mr. Jones, you appeared at rallies in Washington, D.C., on November 14, 2020, 
25 and December 12, 2020. Do you recall that?  12 
1 
2 
3 
4 
5 A On advice of my counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
silent. 
Q In your view, what was the purpose of those events? 
A On advice of my counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
silent. 
Q One of the organizers who was involved in those events, as we understand 
7 it, is an individual who goes by the name Ali Alexander, who is a national organizer for the 
8 Stop the Steal organization. How long have you known Mr. Alexander? 
9 A On advice of my counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
10 silent. 
11 Q It has also been reported that you appeared at what was called a Jericho 
12 March on December 12th. Could you please tell us how you got involved in that event? 
13 A On advice of my counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
14 silent. 
15 Q Well, Mr. Jones, the select committee has reason to think that you have 
16 personal knowledge and experience with events that happened in Washington, D.C., in 
17 November 14th and December 12th, 2020, including interactions with organizers and 
18 groups for those events, including Women for America First, Ali Alexander, and members 
19 of the Jericho March. 
20 The select committee would like to ask you questions about those topics, 
21 including whether you witnessed any violence or physical conflicts between organizers, 
22 attendees, and law enforcement, and whether you --or you knew if any organizers 
23 anticipated violence at those events. 
24 Is it my understanding that you intend to invoke the Fifth Amendment to refuse to 
25 answer questions on those topics?  1 A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
2 silent. 
Q Let's pull up exhibit 3, if we could. 3 
4 Mr. Jones, this is a photograph that was reportedly taken on November 18th, 
5 2020. It shows a group of individuals inside the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta. 
6 Among the people pictured in the photograph are you, on the right is Ali Alexander, and 
7 over your right shoulder is Nick Fuentes. 
8 Whose idea was it to go inside the Georgia State Capitol on November 18th? 
9 A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
10 silent. 
11 Q Did you coordinate that entry with any law enforcement or security in 
12 advance? 13 
13 A On advice of my counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
14 silent. 
15 Q It's been reported that members of a group called the Oath Keepers and 
16 members of a group called the Proud Boys participated in Stop the Steal protests in the 
17 Georgia State Capitol during this period. 
18 To your knowledge, did you speak with any members of those groups about those 
19 events in Georgia in November 2020? 
20 
21 silent. 
22 
23 A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
Q I'd like to show you exhibit 4. 
Mr. Jones, these are excerpts from text messages produced to the select 
24 committee by Ali Alexander, and they show communications with you. You can see on 
25 the left where it says your name, is identifying you as the individual with whom  14 
1 Mr. Alexander was communicating, and there are date and time stamps. 
2 The indication of "outgoing" means it's a message from Mr. Alexander to you, and 
3 "incoming" refers to a message coming from you to Mr. Alexander. 
4 On December 20th, there's an outgoing message from Mr. Alexander to you that 
5 says, quote, "POTUS is deciding in the next 24 to 48 hours if he wants to go," in all caps, 
6 "ALL THE WAY," close quote. 
7 Did you understand what Mr. Alexander meant by that message? 
8 
9 
10 
11 this? A Just a point of technology --
Mr. Pattis. Objection. Objection. Mr. Jones. 
The Witness. I don't --I can't read this. It's too small. Is there a way to widen  1

5 Q 
A 
Q BY 
Absolutely. We can zoom in on it. 
All right. Thank you. Okay. That's too big now. Thank you. 
Our understanding is the message, "POTUS is deciding in the next 24 to 
6 48 hours if he wants to go ALL THE WAY," was a message sent from Ali Alexander to you 
7 on December 20th of 2020? 
8 Did you understand what Mr. Alexander meant by that message? 15 
9 A On advice of my counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
10 silent. 
11 Q If we go to the next page, down to December 30th, there are --the first four 
12 lines there --actually, starting on December 29th is when Mr. Alexander texts you, "Got 
13 time to chat soon?" In response you wrote, "Yes. Off in a few hours. Been off." 
14 Do you recall what your conversation with Mr. Alexander was about on 
15 December 30th of 2020? 
16 A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
17 silent. 
18 Q Well, Mr. Jones, as you can see, the select committee has reason to think 
19 that you have personal knowledge of protest events that took place inside State Capitol 
20 buildings in coordination with Ali Alexander, who was a coordinator for events that 
21 happened on January 6th, 2020. 
22 Is it your intention to assert the Fifth Amendment to all questions that we would 
23 ask about your knowledge of planning and organizing of these events? 
24 
25 A 
Q Yes. 
I'll stop at this point to see if any members have questions.  16 
1 [Pause.] 
2 Hearing none, we'll move on to the next topic. 
3 Mr. Jones, when did you first learn that supporters of President Trump would be 
4 organizing rallies in Washington, D.C., on and around January 6th, 2021? 
5 A On advice of my counsel, I am invoking my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
6 silent. 
7 Q If we could pull up exhibit 5, please. 
8 Mr. Jones, this is an image of a tweet from @realDonaldTrump, which is former 
9 President Trump's Twitter account, and this tweet was posted on December 19th, 2020. 
10 And he writes, "Peter Navarro releases 36-page report alleging election fraud, quote, 
11 'more than sufficient,' close quote, to swing victory to Trump." And then there is a 
12 hyperlink. 
13 "A great report by Peter. Statistically impossible to have lost the 2020 election. 
14 Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!" 
15 We note that after this tweet was posted it seems that you started talking about 
16 an event in Washington, D.C., on January 6th on your radio show. Was this tweet the 
17 first time that you learned about an event in Washington, D.C., in support of the 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 President? 
A 
silent. 
Q 
A 
silent. 
Q On advice of my counsel, I'm invoking my fifth amendment right to remain 
Do you know someone by the name of Cindy Chafian? 
On advice of my counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
Well, Mr. Jones, Ms. Chafian has told us that sometime around 
25 December 19th or 20th she was contacted by Tim Enlow, E-n-1-o-w, whom we understand  17 
1 to be an associate of yours. And according to Ms. Chafian, Mr. Enlow asked her how 
2 you might ensure that you could be on stage for a rally on January 6th. 
3 Do you know about that conversation? 
4 A On advice of counsel, I am asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
5 silent. 
6 Q Now, our understanding is that following that conversation Ms. Chafian 
7 entered into a written agreement with you or your company to organize an event for 
8 which you would provide the funding, which would be held on Freedom Plaza on January 
9 6th, 2021. 
10 I'm asking because we are seeking your view on whether our understanding is 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 accurate. Did you enter into any such agreement with Ms. Chafian? 
A On advice of counsel, I am asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
silent. 
Q Do you know someone by the name of Caroline Wren? 
A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
silent. 
Q If we could pull up exhibit 6, please. 
Mr. Jones, exhibit 6 is an iPhone text message thread produced by Ms. Wren that 
19 we understand to be a conversation with you. The text in blue is Ms. Wren writing, and 
20 the text in gray she understood to be coming from you. And it begins on 
21 December 27th, 2020. 
22 You can see that she sends her contact information to you, and in response you 
23 send her the contact information for Cindy Chafian. 
24 And below that, if we can scroll down a little bit, you wrote, "I told Cindy to call 
25 you when she gets home."  18 
1 Was the purpose of this text to connect Caroline Wren with Cindy Chafian to 
2 coordinate an event on January 6th? 
3 A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
4 silent. 
5 Q And you can see at the bottom of the screen here, it appears to be an audio 
6 message sent from you to Ms. Wren. 
7 Do you recall what you said in these audio messages that were sent to Ms. Wren? 
8 A On advice of my counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
9 silent. 
10 Q Do you still have possession of any audio messages that you sent to 
11 Ms. Wren? 
12 A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
13 silent. 
Q If we can pull up exhibit 7, please. 14 
15 Mr. Jones, this is an email thread between Tim Enlow, whose email address is at 
16 the domain freespeechsystems.com. That's your company, correct? 
17 A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
18 silent. 
19 Q Mr. Enlow is corresponding with Caroline Wren via email, and the subject 
20 line of this thread is "Wiring info." And if we scroll down, we can see that there are 
21 wiring instructions attached to an email from Mr. Enlow to Ms. Wren. 
22 Further down, Ms. Wren sends those wiring instructions to an individual named 
23 Marianne Parsons, whom we know to be a financial manager for a woman named Julie 
24 Fancelli. 
25 Do you know Ms. Fancelli?  19 
1 A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
2 silent. 
3 Q And then further down this email thread you can see that Mr. Enlow is trying 
4 to confirm whether there were any issues with a wire transfer. 
5 And further down, at the bottom on --sorry, there we go --on December 30th at 
6 about 1:19 p.m., Ms. Parsons writes to confirm to Ms. Wren that a wire went out that 
7 morning. 
8 Mr. Jones, to the best of your knowledge, was the purpose of this communication 
9 by Mr. Enlow with Ms. Wren to secure funding for a rally on January 6th, 2021?

Q On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
Was that wire for approximately $200,000? 
On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
Were you aware that ultimately Ms. Fancelli provided much more than 
16 $200,000 in funding for events on January 5th and 6th, 2021? 
17 
18 silent.

20 A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
Q If we can pull up exhibit 8. 
Mr. Jones, these are text messages between Tim Enlow and Caroline Wren. Mr. 
21 Enlow is writing in the gray text, and Ms. Wren is in blue. The text thread starts 
22 December 28th, and it appears to cover the same context of information we looked at in 
23 this email thread about bank wiring information. 
24 If we can go down to December 31st. Here, at 1:20 p.m., Mr. Enlow writes, 
25 "Caroline, we need that contract sent over for Alex and Roger Stone to speak" at the  1 event --"at event on 5th and at event on 6th. Thanks, Tim." 
2 
3 
4 silent. Do you know what contract Mr. Enlow is referring to? 
A On advice of counsel, I am asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 20 
5 Q And it mentions here speaking for Alex, which we understand to be you, and 
6 Roger Stone, on both the 5th and the 6th. 
7 Do you know which events in particular on those dates that Mr. Enlow is referring 
8 to? 
9 A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
10 silent. 
11 Q And if we just pull back to exhibit 6 again. This is, as a reminder, the text 
12 thread between you, Mr. Jones, and Caroline Wren. 
13 On page three of this exhibit, January 1st, at 4:15 p.m., you wrote to Ms. Wren, 
14 "Had a long talk with Roger Stone. Need to talk to you. Thanks." 
15 
16 
17 silent. 
18 What was that long talk with Mr. Stone about, Mr. Jones? 
A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
Q In the clip we looked at with exhibit 2, your conversation with Mr. Stone, you 
19 mentioned to him in your conversation following his deposition that you had to convince 
20 him or beg him --I don't want to mischaracterize the exact words you said, but the 
21 insinuation was that Mr. Stone --you had to have a conversation with him before he 
22 would agree to come and participate in events. 
23 Is that what this conversation is referring to in this text message, Mr. Jones? 
24 A On advice of counsel, I am asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
25 silent.  21 
1 Q Well, Mr. Jones, as you can see from the series of exhibits that we've just 
2 looked at, we have reason to think that you have personal knowledge about planning and 
3 funding for events that were going to take place on January 5th and 6th, including who 
4 was involved in organizing it, where the ultimate funding source was coming from. 
5 And we'd like to ask you about that, in particular understand what the terms of 
6 the contract and agreement were, what your expectations were for the event based on 
7 those conversations. And with respect to Mr. Stone, understanding why it was that he 
8 was hesitant, and in particular whether that hesitance had anything to do with security 
9 concerns for January 5th or 6th. 
10 Is it my understanding that you intend to assert the Fifth Amendment and refuse 
11 to answer any of our questions on those topics? 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 A Because Adam Schiff forges documents. 
Mr. Pattis. Objection. Objection. Mr. Jones. 
The Witness. I don't trust Congressman Schiff. He'll forge stuff. 
Mr. Pattis. Mr. Jones. 
The Witness. Go ahead. Sorry. It's just --
1 appreciate that, Mr. Jones, that this is a stressful situation, and I'm 
18 just trying to be as straight with you as I can be. I want to make sure I understand that 
19 to all those questions about organizing and planning and what you expected ahead of 
20 time with respect to the business arrangements for January 5th and 6th that you intend 
21 to assert the Fifth Amendment to those questions. Is that right? 
22 The Witness. Yes. Yes. I want to tell you guys everything, but I don't trust 
23 Congressman Schiff. So, I mean, I --
24 Mr. Pattis. Alex, may we have a moment, please? 
25 The Witness. Yeah. I don't even know how to control this stuff, Norm. It's a  1 different system than I have. 
2 - Let's go off the record. And then what we can do is --
3 
4 The Witness. I don't want to go off the record. 
I will suggest, Norm, that what we do is we mute, you stop your 22 
5 video. And if you want to have a conversation with Mr. Jones just give him a call. And 
6 then when you pop back on your video we can unmute and go back on the record. 
7 Mr. Pattis. Alex, step out of the room and let's talk on the cell phone for a 
8 minute. 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 The Witness. Okay. I'll be back in a minute. Thanks. 
Mr. Pattis. Thank you. Thank you, sir. 
[Discussion off the record.] 
Let's go back on the record. 
Mr. Pattis. - briefly, thank you for the opportunity to speak to 
14 Mr. Jones. I think it's apparent that he doesn't have a lot of confidence in the partisan 
15 nature of this examination. And as you are probably aware from our informal 
16 discussions, he has a desire to speak but can --and may or may not have information of 
17 relevance or assistance to the committee, but has no confidence in the process. 
18 And so I've instructed Mr. Jones that, in my view, you're simply laying a 
19 foundation to make an application for immunity at some other time to a neutral 
20 magistrate, and we are prepared to proceed. All right? 
21 Thanks for that, Norm. And I won't make any statement regarding 
22 any position other than the fact that, as I've tried to state here, that we have reason to 
23 think he has personal knowledge of information that's within the scope of the select 
24 committee. 
25 Understand his position. But as we've talked about before, our goal is to show  23 
1 that we have a good-faith basis to ask the questions that we're asking and to, if nothing 
2 else, allow him the opportunity to assert his objections on a question-by-question basis. 
3 Mr. Pattis. Understood. And I understand my role is limited here. I just gave 
4 you that as a courtesy to explain the need for the break. Thank you, sir. 
5 
6 
7 
8 Appreciate it. 
BY 
Q Let's go ahead and take a look at exhibit 9. 
Mr. Jones, exhibit 9 is another text message produced by Caroline Wren. This, as 
9 we understand it, is a thread with you. Based on my understanding of how iPhone 
10 Messages works, I believe that the reason there are two AJs listed at the top is because 
11 Ms. Wren may have had two separate contact numbers for you and so --but we 
12 understand it was a message that was sent to you. 
13 And you can see here on December 31st, 2000 --this is 2020 at 11:35 in the 
14 morning, there's a text message from Ms. Wren on the right side of the thread with a PDF 
15 called "Speakers Lineup." 
16 If we scroll down to the second page, we can zoom in. This is a PDF produced by 
17 Ms. Wren that appears to match the attachment that was sent in that text message. 
18 And I'll note that it shows listed speakers and time --essentially a timetable for events 
19 that were going to happen on January 5th and January 6th. 
20 And you can see that on January 5th, at between 5 and 6:30 p.m., under speakers, 
21 you are listed alongside Roger Stone and others to be determined. 
22 And on January 6th you are listed in a block at 8:30 a.m. to 9 a.m. with a point of 
23 contact being Kristen Davis, who we understand to be an associate of Roger Stone. 
24 Are these two events the ones that you understood you would be speaking at on 
25 January 6th?  24 
1 A On advice of counsel, I am asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
2 silent. 
3 Q And if you look down further in what is on my screen a peach tone, maybe a 
4 tan tone, on the January 6th timetable, you can see at 11:08 and 11:15 Congressman X 
5 and Senator X, which we believe are placeholders for slots for Members of Congress to 
6 speak. 
7 Mr. Jones, did you speak with --participate in any discussions about which 
8 Members of Congress should participate in a January 6th event? 
9 A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
10 silent. 
11 Q And if we go to the bottom row of this chart, you can see at 12 p.m. on 
12 January 6th it lists POTUS. 
13 When did you become aware, Mr. Jones, that the President was going to speak at 
14 the Ellipse event? 
15 A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
16 silent. 
17 Q Well, I should note that having reviewed statements that you made around 
18 this time period, on December 29th, 2020, on your show, "The Alex Jones Show," you 
19 said, quote: 
20 "Now I know some incredible information that I'm not at liberty to tell you, but I 
21 am at liberty to just give you a hint, which I don't think is too hard. 
22 "You notice Trump said January 6th will be wild in D.C. Well, it will be wild, and I 
23 can tell you the 'Twilight Zone' nature of all this went up to a whole new level yesterday. 
24 And I'll just leave it at that." 
25 Then you went on to say, "Well, let's just say you're going to want to be in D.C. on  25 
1 the 6th." 
2 The next day, on December 30th, 2020, on that same show, you told listeners you 
3 were, quote, "authorized," quote, to tell your viewers that President Trump would be 
4 speaking on January 6th. 
5 So my question on this is, I think, fairly straightforward. Who was telling you this 
6 information about the President's plans to speak on January 6th? 
7 A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
8 silent. 
9 Q If we can pull up exhibit 8, which we've looked at previously. This is the 
10 text thread between Caroline Wren and Tim Enlow. 
11 On page two, right there in the middle, on Saturday, January 2nd, at 11:14 a.m., 
12 Mr. Enlow sends to Ms. Wren a text message asking for information that could be pushed 
13 out onto social media. He also writes, "Alex is inquiring if anything has changed in 
14 regards to him speaking on the 6th." 
15 Now, ultimately --and then, I think if we scroll down, that same message appears 
16 to have been sent again at 6:03 p.m. inquiring about whether anything has changed 
17 about you speaking on the 6th. And in response Caroline writes back, "No changes. All 
18 good." 
19 Now, obviously, we know that you did not end up speaking at the Ellipse on 
20 January 6th. When did you learn that you would not be speaking at the Ellipse? 
21 A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
22 silent. 
23 Q Mr. Jones, we have learned that certain organizers of the Ellipse rally raised 
24 concerns about certain speakers that had been proposed to speak at that event, including 
25 you and Ali Alexander. And words that witnesses have used --their words, not ours --in  26 
1 describing you and Mr. Alexander, among others, were, quote, "fringe," quote, and one 
2 person even referred to speakers such as yourself and Mr. Alexander as, quote, "crazies," 
3 close quote. 
4 Those concerns, we understand, were raised to the point that ultimately there 
5 was a meeting held with President Trump to determine which speakers would be allowed 
6 on the Ellipse stage. And I'm telling you that to ask you whether you were ever told by 
7 event organizers that they did not want to put you on the same page as --same stage as 
8 President Trump. 
9 A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
10 silent. 
11 Q The questions I've been asking you here relate to speaker lineups essentially. 
12 And as you can see, the select committee has reason to think that you have personal 
13 knowledge of who was being proposed to speak and may also have knowledge or 
14 understanding of why the ultimate speaker lineup became what it did on January 5th and 
15 6th. 
16 Is it your intention to assert the Fifth Amendment to all questions we would ask 
17 about your knowledge of coordination and selection of speakers on January 5th and 6th? 
18 
19 A 
Q 
20 6th events? 
21 A 
22 silent. 
23 Q Yes. 
Mr. Jones, when did you arrive in Washington, D.C., for the January 5th and 
On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
Let's look at exhibit 10. 
24 Mr. Jones, exhibit 10 are two folios from the Willard Intercontinental Hotel in 
25 Washington, D.C., for stays in two rooms between January 4th and 7th, 2021. The first  27 
1 page of this shows a folio under the name Rob Dew with an address in Austin, Texas, for 
2 room 1130? 
3 And if we can go down to the second page. 
4 This is a folio from the Willard also under the name Rob Dew, D-e-w, with the 
5 room number 1124. We understand that room 1124 is the Willard's Federal Suite, and 
6 that room 1130 is the adjoining king bedroom. We also understand that Rob Dew is an 
7 employee of yours. 
8 Did you stay in one of these rooms, Mr. Jones? 
9 
10 silent. 
11 
12 
13 
14 silent. 
15 A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
Q I will note for the record that we've been joined by Ms. Lofgren. 
Mr. Jones, who paid for your hotel room in Washington, D.C.? 
A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
Q We know from the public record, Mr. Jones, that you spoke on the evening 
16 of January 5th at Freedom Plaza. Can you tell us what kinds of security precautions you 
17 took while attending this event? 
18 A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
19 silent. 
20 Q Did you observe any violence or disruptive behavior at that event at 
21 Freedom Plaza that caused you concern? 
22 A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
23 silent. 
24 Q Mr. Jones, we also understand that you attended the Ellipse rally in front of 
25 the White House on January 6th, 2021. Can you share with us your impressions of that  28 
1 event? 
2 A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
3 silent. 
4 Q In particular, I'm curious whether you saw civilians, by which I mean 
5 individuals who are not obviously law enforcement or members of the military, dressed in 
6 body armor near the Ellipse that morning. 
7 Do you remember seeing anyone dressed like that? 
8 A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
9 silent. 
10 Q It's been publicly reported that various speakers at these events used 
11 members of groups like the Oath Keepers or the Proud Boys for security details on 
12 January 5th and 6th. And there's also some video that we'll review in a moment that 
13 appear to show you accompanied by a security detail. 
14 Did you use anyone from the Proud Boys or the Oath Keepers as a member of 
15 your security detail on January 5th or 6th? 
16 A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
17 silent. 
18 Q Is it your intention, Mr. Jones, to invoke the Fifth Amendment to any 
19 questions we might ask you about your personal experience as a speaker on January 5th 
20 or as an attendee of the January 6th Ellipse rally? 
21 
22 A 
Q Yes, it is. 
I'll stop for a moment to see if any members have questions about the topics 
23 we have covered thus far. 
24 
25 [Pause.] 
All right. Let's go ahead back to exhibit 8. These are the texts between  1 Caroline Wren and Mr. Enlow. And we'll go to the page --page five of this exhibit. 
Mr. Pattis. Which exhibit was this again? I'm sorry, -
- This is exhibit 8. 
Mr. Pattis. Thank you, sir.

6 Q Near the bottom of the page, on the fifth page, it's January 5th at 8:07 p.m. 
7 Here Mr. Enlow is writing Ms. Wren to ask for any last-minute updates, including 
8 whether there would be speakers other than POTUS, and asking for how 
9 to --recommendations about what to do in terms of VIPs at the rally. 
10 The following text message is what I want to look at. What's written here is, 
11 "Caroline, Joe Flynn contacted me. The General and his group need six VIP passes. He 
12 also wants to join Roger, Alex, et cetera, in leading the march to the Capitol. How can 
13 we get them VIP passes? He called me about an hour ago." 
14 
15 
16 silent. 
17 Mr. Jones, if you know, is the general referred to here General Michael Flynn? 
A On advice of counsel, I am asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
Q Do you know what march to the Capitol Mr. Enlow is referring to here on the 
18 evening of January 5th? 
19 A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
20 silent. 
21 Q Let's go back to exhibit 6. These are the text messages between you and 
22 Ms. Wren. And we'll go to page eight. 
23 January 6th, at about 12:26 p.m. --or 12:27, I guess --you text Caroline, "What's 
24 the latest on when I go to set up?" Her response is, "Soon." Then, if we go down a 
25 little further, Ms. Wren writes, "He's about halfway, so 15 to 20 more minutes, then I'll  30 
1 grab you." And you respond, "Coming soon." 
2 Mr. Jones, other witnesses who attended the Ellipse rally have told us that they 
3 saw Ms. Wren retrieve you and Ali Alexander from the VIP area of the Ellipse rally before 
4 President Trump finished his speech. Is that accurate? 
5 A On advice of counsel, I am asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
6 silent. 
7 Q Did General Michael Flynn meet up with you after you were taken out of the 
8 Ellipse? 
9 A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
10 silent. 
11 Q It's also been reported and stated publicly by Roger Stone that he did not 
12 participate in any march to the Capitol. Do you know why not? 
13 A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
14 silent. 
15 Q And it seems to us that there at least was some conversation between you 
16 and Ms. Wren and perhaps others, or at least between Mr. Enlow and Ms. Wren and 
17 perhaps others, about a plan to lead a march to the Capitol. 
18 Do you know who devised that plan? 
19 A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
20 silent. 
21 Q We've reviewed videos that have been collected across social media. I'd 
22 like to show you just a couple of those. And I think that you have even discussed what 
23 these videos show on your own radio program. 
24 Let's start with exhibit 11. This is a video that was posted to the social media 
25 website Parler, which is P-a-r-1-e-r, on January 6th at approximately 1:36 p.m. And  31 
1 we're just going to play the first 50 seconds of this. 
2 [Video shown.] 
3 BY 
4 Q Mr. Jones, that may have been a little bit difficult to hear. I'll tell you that 
5 that video appears to show you walking down Pennsylvania Avenue towards the Capitol, 
6 and with you, walking behind you, was Ali Alexander. In the video it sounded that you 
7 were telling those who were with you to go, quote, "to the other side," quote, of the 
8 Capitol and saying that President Trump was going to be coming. 
9 The area that you're referring to on the other side of the Capitol, Mr. Jones, 
10 corresponds with an area that we understand to have been secured by Ali Alexander for a 
11 permitted event. 
12 Is that what you were trying to direct people towards? 
13 A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
14 silent. 
15 Q Mr. Jones, why did you believe that President --or did you, in fact, believe 
16 President Trump was going to be coming to the Capitol Grounds that day? 
17 
18 silent. 
19 
20 
21 A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
Q Let's take a look at exhibit 12. 
And I'd note for the record that Mr. Aguilar has joined us. 
Exhibit 12 is another --yeah, let me just explain some context. This is another 
22 video that was posted to Parler on January 6th. The time stamp on this, we understand, 
23 is approximately 1:51 p.m., so it's about 15 minutes after the video that we just saw in 
24 exhibit 11. 
25 We're going to watch the whole clip, which is about a minute and 18 seconds long.  1 
2 
3 [Video shown.] 
BY 
Q Mr. Jones, in this video, which I know you've discussed on your own radio 32 
4 program, you're telling the crowd gathered to remain peaceful and to go to the other side 
5 of the Capitol. You again are telling them that the President is going to come around to 
6 that side of the Capitol and speak. 
7 My question for you is, where did you get the information that the President was 
8 going to come to the Capitol? 
9 A On advice of counsel, I am asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
10 silent. 
11 Q And you also, as I said, are imploring the crowd to remain peaceful. Is that 
12 because you thought it was possible that individuals who were otherwise there as 
13 supporters of President Trump might get riled up into some physical confrontations with 
14 law enforcement? 
15 A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
16 silent. 
17 Q Let's watch exhibit 13. For context, Mr. Jones, this is a clip from your 
18 program, "The Alex Jones Show," on January 7th, 2021, the day after the attack on the 
19 Capitol. And we're going to play the first 46 seconds of this clip until you say, "I'm going 
20 to meet you at the Capitol." 
21 [Video shown.] 
22 BY 
23 Q Mr. Jones, in that clip you say, quote, "The White House told me 3 days 
24 before we're going to have you lead the march. The Secret Service, before Trump 
25 finished, 30 minutes before or so, will lead you to a point, take you out of the front row,  33 
1 and lead you to the place where they want you to start the march. And Trump will tell 
2 people, 'Go, and I'm going to meet you at the Capitol."' 
3 Mr. Jones, when you say that the White House told you, who are you referring to? 
4 A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
5 silent. 
6 Q Is it possible that you're referring to Caroline Wren as opposed to someone 
7 who is an employee of the White House? 
8 A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
9 silent. 
10 Q And I ask you that because we have heard from other witnesses who have 
11 told us that they got contacts from the White House, and it turned out the person they 
12 were speaking to is Caroline Wren. And we just want to clarify whether there's 
13 messaging coming directly from the White House or messaging that people thought was 
14 coming from the White House through Caroline Wren. 
15 So is it Caroline Wren who's telling you this or someone else? 
16 A On advice of my counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
17 silent. 
18 Q Now, we also understand from our conversations that the United States 
19 Secret Service did not have anything to do with leading you out of the Ellipse to a point to 
20 begin a march to the Capitol. Is that accurate? 
21 A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
22 silent. 
23 Q Were there any White House employees at all who communicated anything 
24 of the sort about leading you out of the Ellipse and helping you lead a march to the 
25 Capitol?  34 
1 A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
2 silent. 
3 Q Mr. Jones, as you can see, we have reason to think that you have personal 
4 knowledge about this idea of a march to the Capitol, and in particular, whether the 
5 President would go and meet people and speak on the Capitol Grounds. 
6 And I just want to clarify that it's your intention to assert the Fifth Amendment to 
7 any questions that we would ask you about your personal knowledge of plans to march 
8 from the Ellipse to the Capitol on January 6th? 
9 
10 A 
Q Yes. 
Now, do you think that the statements that you made to the crowds that are 
11 captured on the videos that we watched are incriminating against you? 
12 A On advice of my counsel, I am asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
13 silent. 
14 Q I'm going to ask the same thing about the statements that you made on "The 
15 Alex Jones Show" on January 7th. 
16 When you explain that you understood ahead of time that you were to help lead a 
17 march and the President would come to the Capitol, when you were making those 
18 statements, at that time, did you think that those statements opened you to the 
19 possibility of prosecution? 
20 A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
21 silent. 
22 Q Let me pause and see if any of the members who are with us have questions 
23 about the topics that we've covered. 
24 [Pause.] 
25 Hearing none, let's watch exhibit 14. And, Mr. Jones, this is the last exhibit.  35 
1 This is a clip from "The Alex Jones Show" from December 31st, 2020. So New 
2 Year's Eve before January 6th. 
3 As I understand it, the individual who we can see here on the screen is named

5 that day.

7 larger chunk of the show that day and the last section is Mr. Bracken.

4 Q Mr. Jones, I know you are not in this clip and that you were not hosting the 
5 show during the portion that Mr. Bracken made these statements. But what he said 
6 was he's suggesting Americans are only going to be saved by going to Washington D.C. 
7 And the specific statement he said, quote, was, "Occupying the entire area, if 
8 necessary, storming right into the Capitol. We know the rules of engagement. If you 
9 have enough people, you can push down any kind of fence or a wall," close quote. 
10 Mr. Jones, I know that you maintain frequent communication with your viewers 
11 and your followers. Did you hear anything from your viewers or followers about their 
12 reactions to Mr. Bracken's statement to the best of your recollection? 
13 A I'd like to answer that question. But on advice of my counsel, I am 
14 asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. 
15 Q And when you were making plans to go to Washington, D.C., for January 5th 
16 and 6th, were you aware that others on your radio show had suggested Americans might 
17 need to storm into the Capitol? 
18 A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
19 silent. 
20 Q Mr. Jones, we're aware that Stewart Rhodes, who is the national leader and 
21 founder of the Oath Keepers organization, has appeared on your radio show on various 
22 occasions throughout the years, including after the November 2020 Presidential election. 
23 And he told you at one point between the period of --between the election and 
24 January 6th that the Oath Keepers had men stationed outside of Washington, D.C., in 
25 case what he referred to as a, quote, "nuclear option," close quote, to respond to any  37 
1 calls from President Trump or attempts to remove the President, quote, "illegally," close 
2 quote? 
3 Now, did Mr. Rhodes or anyone else that you know to be associated with the Oath 
4 Keepers tell you about any specific plans they had to enter the United States Capitol on 
5 January 6th? 
6 A On advice of my counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment rights to remain 
7 silent. 
8 Q According to The New York Times in an article published on October 7th, 
9 2021, one of the first individuals who broke through the barriers on the Capitol Grounds 
10 on the morning --on the afternoon of January 6th told law enforcement that a man 
11 named Joseph Biggs, B-i-g-g-s, who has been identified as a leader of the Proud Boys, this 
12 is the quote that The New York Times had describing what this individual said. That 
13 Mr. Biggs, quote, "encouraged him to push at the barricades and that when he hesitated, 
14 the Proud Boys leader flashed a gun, questioned his manhood, and repeated his demand 
15 to move up front and challenge the police," close quote. 
16 This article also notes that at some point in the past Mr. Biggs was a 
17 correspondent for lnfowars. 
18 Mr. Jones, did Joseph Biggs or anyone else who you know to be associated with 
19 the Proud Boys ever tell you about any specific plans to challenge police or enter the 
20 U.S. Capitol on January 6th, 2021? 
21 A On advice of counsel, I am asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
22 silent. 
23 Q Did anyone, regardless of their membership in an organization or group, tell 
24 you that they were making plans to enter the United States Capitol to disrupt Congress on 
25 January 6th?  38 
1 A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment rights to remain 
2 silent. 
3 Q Mr. Jones, did you see or hear anything ahead of January 6th that gave you 
4 personal concern or pause that the events would be anything other than a peaceful 
5 political protest? 
6 A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
7 silent. 
8 Q Is it your intention, Mr. Jones, to assert the Fifth Amendment to all questions 
9 that we would ask you regarding what you may know, have seen, or heard regarding any 
10 specific plans to enter the Capitol on January 6th? 
11 
12 
13 
14 A It is. 
- Let me stop and see if any members have questions on that topic. 
BY 
Q Mr. Jones, have you been interviewed by law enforcement regarding your 
15 knowledge of events in Washington, D.C., on January 6th, 2021? 
16 A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
17 silent. 
18 Q Have you been contacted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding 
19 January 6th, 2021? 
20 A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
21 silent. 
22 Q Following January 6th, 2021, have you been contacted by people you who 
23 know to be attorneys representing individuals charged with criminal conduct from that 
24 day about January 6th? 
25 A On advice of counsel, I'm asserting my Fifth Amendment right to remain  39 
1 silent. 
2 Q Mr. Jones, is it your intention to assert the Fifth Amendment against all 
3 questions we would ask you about contacts from law enforcement or attorneys 
4 representing defendants charged with criminal conduct from that day? 
A Yes. 5 
6 At this point, Mr. Jones has asserted the Fifth Amendment as a basis 
7 to refuse to answer all of the select committee's questions today. Under these 
8 circumstances, we will not close the record on the deposition because the select 
9 committee has to determine the appropriate course of action moving forward on those 
10 objections. 
11 Before we go off the record, however, I want to pause and make sure that I give 
12 time to any members and then staff who may have follow-up questions. 
13 
14 [Pause.] 
Okay. Hearing none, Mr. Pattis, Mr. Jones --Mr. Aguilar, you don't have a 
15 question, do you? Okay. Thank you. 
16 Mr. Jones, Mr. Pattis, thank you for your time today. 
17 The deposition will stand in recess subject to the call of the chair.
