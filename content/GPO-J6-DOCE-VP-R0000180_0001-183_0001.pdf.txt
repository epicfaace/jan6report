Lengthy, but discusses the various arguments fairly comprehensively. 
I think it fair to say that there are very credible arguments on both sides.

IS THE ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL? 
V ASAN KESA VAN• 
This Article takes on one of the most unasked questions of Bush v. 
Gore-whether the Electoral Count Act, the federal statutory 
scheme at. issue in that case, is constitutional. Enacted in 1887 and 
hardly discussed for the past 114 years, the Electoral Count Act 
sets forth complicated regulations for counting ( and not counting) 
electoral votes. This Article argues that Section 15 of Title 3 of the 
United States Code, the heart of the Electoral Count Act, is 
unconstitutional. 
Since 1800, Congress has attempted to enact legislation regulating 
the electoral count, finally succeeding in 1887. This Article traces 
these principal congressional efforts to regulate the electoral count 
and the surrounding constitutional text and structure to show why 
the Electoral Count Act is unconstitutional. The Electoral Count 
Act may seem like a good statutory scheme to deal with the 
problems of the electoral count, but not every good statutory 
scheme is a constitutional one. Some problems may only be 
remedied by constitutional amendment, not by statute. Anyone 
who wishes to argue that the Electoral Count Act is constitutional 
bears a very high burden of proof

1656 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 80 
The first three of these questions might seem downright 
outlandish, and prior to the presidential election of 2000, the fourth 
was too. Now is a good time to remember that these four questions 
were not at all outlandish in the spring of 1800 when America faced 
her first electoral crisis of "Jefferson v. Adams."3 These four 
3. The presidential election of 1800 and the electoral count of 1801 were truly a 
constitutional crisis of the first magnitude, leading to the adoption of the Twelfth 
Amendment in 1804. The electoral count on February 11, 1801 was inconclusive because 
there were two persons who had the requisite majority of the whole number of electors 
appointed. (The original Constitution did not require or even permit electors to cast 
separate votes for President and Vice President). Democrat-Republican and then-Vice 
President Thomas Jefferson and Democrat-Republican Aaron Burr each received 
seventy-three votes; Federalist and then-President John Adams and Federalist Charles C. 
Pinckney received sixty-five and sixty-four votes, respectively; Federalist John Jay 
received one vote. 
The choice of President thus devolved on the House of Representatives. U.S. 
CONST. art. II, § 1, cl. 3 provides: 
The Person having the greatest Number of Votes shall be the President, if such 
Number be a Majority of the whole Number of Electors appointed; and if there 
be more than one who have such Majority, and have an equal Number of Votes, 
then the House of Representatives shall immediately chuse by Ballot one of 
them for President .... But in chusing the President, the Votes shall be taken by 
States, the Representation from each State having one Vote .... 
The House, controlled by Federalists, was forced to choose between Democrat­
Republicans Jefferson and Burr. On February 11, the House balloted nineteen times with 
no success: each time eight states voted for Jefferson, six for Burr, and two were divided. 
On February 12, the House balloted nine times with no success; on February 13, once; 
February 14, four times; and February 16, once. On February 17, after another such 
round, the House chose a President-elect on the thirty-sixth round of balloting: ten states 
voted for Jefferson, four for Burr and two did not vote. For the basic facts of the election 
of 1800 and the electoral count of 1801, see BERNARD A. WEISBERGER, AMERICA 
AFIRE: JEFFERSON, ADAMS, AND THE REVOLUTIONARY ELECTION OF 1800, at 227-77 
(2000). 
To complicate this saga further, Democrat-Republicans Jefferson and Burr only 
had a majority of the whole number of electors appointed because Vice President 
Jefferson, presiding over the electoral count, decided to count four "improper" votes from 
the State of Georgia in favor of Jefferson-Burr. See infra note 230 and accompanying text. 
Without these votes, Jefferson and Burr would have had sixty-nine votes each, exactly one 
half and not a majority of the whole number of electors appointed, and the choice of 
President would have devolved on the House of Representatives. But importantly, the 
original Constitution provided that "if no Person have a Majority, then from the five 
highest on the List the said House in like Manner chuse the President." U.S. CONST. art. 
II, § 1, cl. 3 (emphasis added). There is little doubt that the Federalist-controlled House 
would have elected Federalists John Adams and Charles C. Pinckney as President and 
Vice President, respectively. 
Perhaps most intriguingly, the Federalist-controlled Legislature of Maryland, 
aware of the popular support for Democrat-Republicans Jefferson-Burr, 
seriously contemplated that the legislature should repeal the law under which the 
electors were chosen by the people, and should choose them by the legislature; 
and this on the avowed ground that it was necessary to defeat the candidate 
whom it was supposed that the majority of the people preferred.

INTRODUCTION 
Bush v. Gore1 is history. We all have plenty to think about. So 
here are four questions that are well worth considering before 
Election Day 2004, or at least January 6, 2005, the date specified by 
federal law for counting electoral votes.2 What if an elector votes for 
a presidential or vice presidential candidate who is not a natural born 
citizen, at least thirty-five years of age, and who has not been a 
resident of the United States long enough? What if an elector who is 
constitutionally ineligible to be an elector votes? What if an elector 
votes for inhabitants of her state for both President and Vice 
President? What if two sets of electors from the same state both 
claim that they are the lawfully appointed electors of the state? 
1. 531 U.S. 98 (2000) (per curiam). 
2. See 3 U.S.C. § 15 (2000) ("Congress shall be in session on the sixth day of January 
succeeding every meeting of the electors.").  VP-R0000181_0006

2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 1657 
questions were the paradigm problems of the electoral count debated 
in the Sixth Congress.4 Federalist Senator Ross of Pennsylvania 
firmly stated that "such cases might happen and were very likely to 
happen."5 Democrat-Republican Senator Pinckney of South 
Carolina, more sanguine, stated that these cases "may not happen 
once in a century."6 In addition to these four problems of the 
electoral count, a fifth problem has proved much more likely 
throughout history: What if an elector is "faithless" and votes for a 
President or Vice President in contravention of the popular vote?7 
13, at 443 (1877) [hereinafter COUNUNG ELECTORAL VOTES] (remarks of Sen. 
Anthony). This should sound familiar. This action was not carried out, but had it been, 
Maryland's ten electoral votes would have been given solely to Federalists Adams and 
Pinckney, instead of having been given equally to Jefferson and Adams. Adams would 
have received 70 votes; Pinckney 69 votes; Jefferson 68 votes; Burr 68 votes; and Jay 1 
vote. Adams and Pinckney would have become President and Vice President respectively. 
According to Senator Anthony, "[T]he election would have been strictly and 
unquestionably legal and constitutional." Id. This point is subject to serious debate today. 
There may be a constitutional right to vote for presidential and vice presidential electors, 
at least in some cases. See U.S. CONST. amend. XIV, § 2; U.S. CONST. amend. XXIV; 
Michael C Dorf, We Need A Constitutional Right To Vote in Presidential Elections (Dec. 
13, 2000), at http:/lwrit.findlaw.com/dorf/20001213.html (on file with the North Carolina 
Law Review). But see Bush, 531 U.S. at 104 ("The State, of course, after granting the 
franchise in the special context of Article II, can take back the power to appoint 
electors.") ( citation omitted). 
The presidential election of 1800 and the electoral count of 1801 is currently the 
subject of a fascinating, timely, and forthcoming book by Professor Bruce Ackerman. 
BRUCE ACKERMAN, AMERICA ON THE BRINK: THE CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS OF THE 
EARLY REPUBLIC (forthcoming 2002) ( on file with the North Carolina Law Review). For 
two rich discussions of the election of 1800, see generally Joanne B. Freeman, The Election 
of 1800: A Study in the Logic of Political Change, 108 YALE LJ. 1959 (1999); John J. 
Janssen, Dualist Constitutional Theory and the Republican Revolution of 1800, 12 CONST. 
COMMENT. 381 (1995). For a recent book-length treatment, see WEISBERGER, supra. 
4. For specific reference to these four questions, see, for example, 10 ANNALS OF 
CONG. 29 (1800) (remarks of Sen. Ross); id. at 131 (remarks of Sen. Pinckney); id. at 133 
(remarks of Sen. Pinckney). 
5. Id. at 29. 
6. Id. at 132. 
7. Thankfully, the problem has been a very small one, with approximately a dozen 
electors of over 25,000 casting votes in opposition to the wishes of the voters in the course 
of 213 years. See Beverly J. Ross & William Josephson, The Electoral College and the 
Popular Vote, 12 J.L. & POL. 665, 667 (1996). There is no consensus on the exact number 
of faithless electors since the Founding. The paradigm case is that of Samuel Miles, a 
Federalist elector from Pennsylvania, who in 1796, just eight years after the adoption of 
the Constitution and in the third presidential election, voted for Democrat-Republican 
Jefferson instead of Federalist Adams. This action prompted a Federalist voter to 
exclaim: "Do I chuse Samuel Miles to determine for me whether John Adams or Thomas 
Jefferson shall be President? No! I chuse him to act, not to think." E. STANWOOD, A 
HISTORY OF THE PRESIDENCY 51 (August M. Kelley Publishers 1975) (1928). 
The faithless elector problem was of particular concern in the presidential election 
of 2000: Any two faithless votes by Bush electors would have thrown the election into the 
House of Representatives, and any three faithless votes would have thrown the election to  VP-R0000181_0007

1658 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 80 
What does the Constitution say about these potential problems? 
The relevant text of the Constitution simply provides that "[t]he 
President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House 
of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall then 
be counted."8 It ought to be obvious that the Constitution does not 
provide any answers to these tricky problems of the electoral count.9 
The Framers and Ratifiers simply did not contemplate the 
possibilities of unconstitutional or faithless electoral votes. 
The critical question is whether we can fix the casus omissus of 
the Constitution short of constitutional amendment. The counting of 
the electoral votes is no trivial matter. It is the critical step in the 
election of the President and Vice President. As one leading scholar 
has stated, it seems to be "the magic, formal moment of vesting in 
which the winning candidate is elected as 'President.' mo Some might 
quibble with this formalist point, but at the founding, when there 
were no telegraphs, telephones, or television, and when electoral 
former Vice President Gore. Going into December 18, 2000 (the date specified by federal 
law for the giving of electoral votes by the electors), the expected electoral count was 271 
votes for Bush and 267 votes for Gore. The final electoral count for President was 271 
votes for Bush and 266 votes for Gore. See 147 CONG. REC. H44 (2001). One Gore­
Lieberman elector from the District of Columbia, protesting the District's lack of 
statehood, refused to cast her votes for President and Vice President. See Charles 
Babington, Electors Reassert Their Role; Bush Wins Vote; Protest Costs Gore, WASH. 
POST., Dec.19, 2000, at Al. For additional discussion of the faithless elector problem, see 
infra notes 176-191, 590-592 and accompanying text. 
8. U.S. CONST. amend. XII. The only differences between this text of the Twelfth 
Amendment and the text of the original Constitution are in punctuation and 
capitalization. See U.S. CONST. art. II, § 1, cl. 3 ("The President of the Senate shall, in the 
Presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the Certificates, and the 
Votes shall then be counted."). The Twelfth Amendment overwrote U.S. CONST. art. II, 
§ 1, cl. 3, but not two other clauses that relate to the Electoral College mode of 
presidential election, U.S. CONST. art. II, § 1, els. 2, 4. For ease of exposition, I will 
variously refer to these clauses as the "Electoral College Clauses." 
9. As Justice Joseph Story described: 
In the original plan, as well as in the amendment, no provision is made for the 
discussion or decision of any questions, which may arise, as to the regularity and 
authenticity of the returns of the electoral votes, or the right of the persons, who 
gave the votes, or the manner, or circumstances, in which they ought to be 
counted. It seems to have been taken for granted, that no question could ever 
arise on the subject; and that nothing more was necessary, than to open the 
certificates, which were produced, in the presence of both houses, and to count 
the names and numbers, as returned.

votes were more secret, there was no way of knowing the identity of 
the winning candidates until the electoral votes were formally 
counted. Recent history should be a powerful reminder of the 
significance of the electoral count. One key lesson of the presidential 
election of 2000 is that the President-elect is not elected by "We the 
People" on election day, or even by the electors on the day they cast 
their votes, but by the joint convention of the Senate and House of 
Representatives on the day the electoral votes are formally counted. 
The counting function appears to be a ministerial duty of 
tabulation imposed by the Constitution because each of the electoral 
colleges meet in their respective states instead of at some central 
location. Conventional wisdom holds that the joint convention of the 
Senate and House of Representatives does the counting, and not the 
President of the Senate, but this is not at all clear from the text of the 
Electoral College Clauses. But does the counting function subsume 
the power not to count? What about unconstitutional votes? What 
about faithless votes? 
As is now somewhat well known, Congress has answered the 
question whether the counting function subsumes the power not to 
count affirmatively. The relevant statute is the Electoral Count Act 
of 1887,11 presently codified at 3 U.S.C. §§ 5-6, 15-18. The heart of 
the Electoral Count Act is undisputedly 3 U.S.C. § 15, a complicated 
provision that sets forth rules for counting ( and not counting) 
electoral votes. In a nutshell, this section provides that in a case of 
single returns, the joint convention may only reject electoral votes 
that are not "regularly given" if both Houses of Congress concur.12 In 
a case of multiple returns from the same state, this section provides 
that the joint convention may only accept electoral votes as "regularly 
given" if both Houses of Congress concur (with a few important 
wrinkles to be discussed later).13 The meaning of the phrase 
"regularly given"14 in § 15 is far from clear. The precedents of the 
electoral count, however, strongly suggest that the joint convention 
will not count unconstitutional votes, and possibly not faithless votes 
either. 
While 3 U.S.C. § 15 sets forth the rules for counting (and not 
counting) electoral votes, 3 U.S.C. § 5, the specific federal statutory 
provision at issue in Bush v. Gore, sets forth the so-called "safe 
11. Act of Feb. 3, 1887, ch. 90, 24 Stat. 373 (codified as amended at 3 U.S.C. §§ 5-
6, 15-18 (2000)).

1660 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 80 
harbor" provision for counting electoral votes with respect to a state's 
determination of any controversy or contest concerning the 
appointment of its electors.15 Bush v. Gore indicates that there must 
be nine votes on the Supreme Court for the proposition that 3 U.S.C. 
§ 5 is constitutional. Although neither party briefed or argued the 
constitutionality of this provision of the Electoral Count Act, each of 
the Justices must have reached an independent, antecedent 
determination that 3 U.S.C. § 5 passes constitutional muster.16 
Curiously, Bush v. Gore, for all that it did address regarding 
presidential election, did not address the heart of the Electoral Count 
Act-3 U.S.C. § 15. Only Justice Breyer, with Justices Stevens and 
Ginsburg concurring, even mentioned this key section, and he did so 
approvingly.17 The prevailing wisdom, in the Supreme Court and 
elsewhere, is that the Electoral Count Act is constitutional.18 
15. Id.§ 5. 
16. Needless to say, this assumes that each of the Justices was doing his or her job, 
and not violating his or her oath to support the Constitution, see U.S. CONST. art. VI, cl. 3, 
which is an assumption that may beget controversy, depending on one's jurisprudential 
(political?) preferences. 
17. See 531 U.S. 98, 153-54 (2000) (Breyer, J., dissenting) ("[T]he Twelfth 
Amendment commits to Congress the authority and responsibility to count electoral votes. 
A federal statute, the Electoral Count Act, enacted after the close 1876 Hayes-Tilden 
presidential election, specifies that, after States have tried to resolve disputes (through 
'judicial' or other means), Congress is the body primarily authorized to resolve remaining 
disputes."); id. at 155 (Breyer, J., dissenting) ("Given this detailed, comprehensive scheme 
for counting electoral votes [3 U.S.C. § 15], there is no reason to believe that federal law 
either foresees or requires resolution of such a political issue by this Court."). Others 
have similarly argued that the "political question doctrine," see, e.g., Baker v. Carr, 369 
U.S. 186, 217 (1962), counsels (if not requires) that the Supreme Court should not have 
entered the fray in the presidential election of 2000. See, e.g., Laurence H. Tribe, Erog v. 
Hsub and Its Disguises: Freeing Bush v. Gore from Its Hall of Mirrors, 115 HARV. L. REV. 
170, 276-87 (2001 ); id. at 277 n.433 ( citing argument made by Professors Charles Fried and 
Einer Elhauge in Brief of the Florida Senate and House of Representatives as Amici 
Curiae in Support of Neither Party at 7, Bush v. Palm Beach County Canvassing Bd., 531 
U.S. 70 (2000) (No. 00-836)); Rachel E. Barkow, More Supreme than Court? The Fall of 
the Political Question Doctrine and the Rise of Judicial Supremacy, 102 COLUM. L. REV. 
237, 273-300 (2002). Whether Bush v. Gore presented a non-justiciable political question 
is beyond the scope of this Article. 
18. Only a handful of scholars have addressed the constitutionality of the Electoral 
Count Act since its initial adoption more than one hundred and twenty years ago. 
Professor Spear, writing in 1877, concluded that the Electoral Count Act of 1877 was 
unconstitutional. See Samuel T. Spear, D.D., Counting the Electoral Votes, 15 ALB. L.J. 
156, 156--61 (1877). Professor Burgess, writing in 1888, concluded that the Electoral Count 
Act of 1887 was constitutional. See John W. Burgess, The Law of the Electoral Count, 3 
POL. SCI. Q. 633, 653 (1888). More recently, Professor Ross and Mr. Josephson have 
apparently concluded that the Electoral Count Act is constitutional. See Ross & 
Josephson, supra note 7, at 704-40. 
Two other scholars have obliquely addressed the constitutionality of the Electoral 
Count Act in recent years. Professor Glennon, in his primer on the Electoral College,  VP-R0000181_0010 
(2021-079) 
2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 1661 
Yet there has been virtually no scrutiny of this conventional 
wisdom in the wake of Bush v. Gore. One of the most unasked 
questions regarding the presidential election of 2000 is whether the 
federal statutory scheme at issue in that case is constitutional. 
This Article argues that the Electoral Count Act, specifically 3 
U.S.C. § 15, is unconstitutional. The Electoral Count Act violates the 
text and structure of the Constitution in multiple ways. For example, 
where is the font of express or implied power to pass the Electoral 
Count Act? Where does Congress have the power to regulate the 
manner of presidential election? Where do the Electoral College 
Clauses provide for bicameralism in counting electoral votes? What 
gives the 49th Congress the authority to bind future Congresses and 
joint conventions in counting electoral votes? 
More generally: What gives the joint convention the power to 
judge the validity of electoral votes? The counting function seems to 
be arithmetic and ministerial. If the joint convention could judge 
electoral votes, it could reject enough votes to thwart the electors' will 
or trigger a contingency election for President in the House of 
Representatives and for Vice President in the Senate, thereby 
arrogating to the two Houses of Congress the power to appoint the 
Nation's two highest executive officers.19 The tight margin of the 
somewhat casually concludes that the Electoral Count Act is constitutional. See MICHAEL 
J. GLENNON, WHEN NO MAJORITY RULES: THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE AND 
PRESIDENTIAL SUCCESSION 35-43 (1992). Professor Amar, in an article on presidential 
succession, assumes that the Electoral Count Act is constitutional in the course of 
proposing an improvement to the process of presidential election. He suggests that 
"Congress should provide by statute that an electoral vote for any person who is dead at 
the time of the congressional counting is a valid vote, and will be counted, so long as the 
death occurred on or after Election Day." Amar, supra note 10, at 222. 
Most recently, after Bush v. Gore, several commentators have assessed the 
constitutionality of the Electoral Count Act, but only in passing. See, e.g., SAMUEL 
ISSACHAROFF ET AL., WHEN ELECTIONS GO BAD: THE LAW OF DEMOCRACY AND THE 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 2000, at 98 {2001) ("Questions about the constitutionality of 
the Electoral Count Act have been raised but never fully addressed."); Dan T. Coenen &

Past and Reforms for the Future, 43 WM. & MARYL. REV. 851, 860-71, 909-16 (2002)

enact such legislation should support national-ballot and voting equipment legislation);

presidential election of 2000-in both the popular vote and electoral 
vote-demonstrates that these possibilities are not necessarily 
remote. In a close presidential election, every electoral vote counts. 
As Chancellor Kent put the point in his treatise on the Constitution 
first published over 175 years ago, "In the case of questionable votes, 
and a closely contested election, this [ counting] power may be all­
important. "20 As bizarre as it may seem, the joint convention must 
count the electoral votes-including unconstitutional or faithless 
votes. As unfortunate as it may be, a solution to the problem of 
unconstitutional or faithless electoral votes requires constitutional 
amendment. The constitutional infirmities of the electoral count are 
yet additional reasons to scrap the Electoral College mode of 
presidential election altogether. 
This Article proceeds in three parts. Part I presents the history 
of the electoral count, addressing the principal congressional efforts 
to regulate presidential election and the electoral count, and the 
actual problems of the electoral counts from the Founding to today. 
Part II contains the constitutional argument against the 
constitutionality of Electoral Count Act and sets forth "interpretivist" 
arguments from constitutional text and structure.21 Part III considers 
electors appointed by the several States, and thereby creating by themselves and 
for themselves the contingency which alone gives them the right and power to 
elect a President and Vice-President? 
See also 18 CONG. REC. 74 (1886) (remarks of Rep. Baker) (similar). 
Early commentators on the Constitution, writing in the wake of the electoral crisis 
of 1800-01, were quick to point out the evils of presidential election by the House of 
Representatives. See, e.g., 1 ST. GEORGE TuCKER, BLACKSTONE'S COMMENTARIES 
WITH NOTES OF REFERENCE TO 1HE CONSTITUTION AND LAWS OF THE FEDERAL 
GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA, 
app. at 327 (1803) [hereinafter TuCKER'S COMMENTARIES]. St. George Tucker stated: 
Then, indeed, intrigue and cabal may have their full scope: then, may the 
existence of the union be put in extreme hazard: then might a bold and 
desperate party, having the command of an armed force, and of all the resources 
of government, attempt to establish themselves permanently in power, without 
the future aid of forms, or the control of elections.

what should happen if the Electoral Count Act is unconstitutional, 
and electors go bananas and cast unconstitutional or faithless votes. 
This Part suggests answers to the paradigm problems of the electoral 
count and considers where we should go from here. 
I. 1iIB HISTORY OF Tiffi ELECTORAL COUNT 
The history of the electoral count is woefully understudied.22 
This is especially problematic because "[d]isputes concerning 
presidential electors and their votes are more common than one may 
think."23 Although the electoral count's history does not directly ( or 
necessarily) bear on the constitutionality of the Electoral Count Act, 
it is worth studying for at least a few reasons. First, there is much we 
can learn about our electoral past. Given the risk that history might 
repeat itself, the history of the electoral count furnishes important 
precedent for future electoral disputes, in much the same way as cases 
furnish precedent for future cases.24 Second, participants in the 
Electoral Count Act debates referred to the history of the electoral 
subject matter. The arguments run as follows: the electoral college mode of presidential 
election has worked in ways never contemplated by the Framers and Ratifiers-with the 
advent of political parties, not to mention the perfunctory role of electors themselves in 
presidential election. Indeed, one might say that the electoral college mode of presidential 
election has (ironically or not) worked in a way positively antithetical to the original 
expectations of the Framers and Ratifiers. Moreover, as we shall see, the constitutional 
lacunae seem to be especially large when it comes to the thorny issues of the electoral 
count-these issues were under-specified from the start. And so the argument concludes 
that constitutional meaning should be determined by subsequent practice-what works, or 
has been accepted as if valid-more than by constitutional text and structure. 
Nevertheless, this Article's methodological approach does yield (I submit) a definitive 
result as to the constitutionality of the Electoral Count Act. It is rather difficult to see why 
non-constitutional developments in electoral politics relating to presidential election­
however stark when compared to the Founding-create congressional power to regulate 
the electoral count when none existed. In any case, this Article's methodological 
approach is far from useless even for those who choose to ignore its results. See Akhil 
Reed Amar, A Neo-Federalist View of Article III: Separating the Two Tiers of Federal 
Jurisdiction, 65 B.U. L. REV. 205, 207-08 n.7 (1985) (discussing the value of 
"interpretivist" methodology whether or not one subscribes to its results). 
22. The vade mecum in the study of the history of the electoral count is a House 
Special Committee report issued after the Hayes-Tilden presidential election of 1872. See 
COUNTING ELECTORAL VOTES, supra note 3; see also 3 RIND'S PRECEDENTS OF THE 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES 209-67 (Alfred C. Hinds ed., 
1907) (discussing the electoral counts of 1789 to 1905). Two scholars have also nicely 
summarized the relevant history. See generally C.C. Tansill, Congressional Control of the 
Electoral System, 34 YALE L.J. 511 (1924-25); L. Kinvin Wroth, Election Contests and the 
Electoral Vote, 65 DICK. L. REV. 321 (1961).

count in debating the constitutionality of the Electoral Count Act. A 
familiarity with the history of the electoral count better informs these 
legislative debates. Third, participants in the Electoral Count Act 
debates referred to the history of the electoral count-and specifically 
the actual problems of the electoral count-in debating the necessity 
and expediency of the Electoral Count Act. A critical examination of 
this history better affords a basis to assess whether the Electoral 
Count Act is necessary and expedient to address these historical 
problems and whether there may be other non-statutory solutions. 
This Part seeks to fill this void in scholarship and proceeds in two 
sections. The first section summarizes four principal congressional 
efforts-three successful, one not-to regulate presidential election 
and the electoral count, including the Act of 1792, the Grand 
Committee Bill, the Twenty-second Joint Rule, and finally the 
Electoral Count Act. The second section summarizes the actual 
problems of the electoral count. In the course of fifty-four electoral 
counts in the history of the Republic, there have been only a dozen or 
so problems of the electoral count, most of which occurred in the 
nineteenth-century.25 
A. Congressional Efforts to Regulate Presidential Election and the 
Electoral Count 
1. Act of March 1, 1792 
On March 1, 1792, the Second Congress passed "An Act relative 
to the election of a President and Vice-President of the United States 
and declaring the officer who shall act as President in case of 
vacancies in the offices both of President and Vice-President."26 The 
Act thus regulated presidential election and presidential succession, 
the latter pursuant to Article II, Section 1, Clause 6.27 
25. As of 1886, Senator Sherman observed that "[s]ince [the Founding] there have 
been eleven cases of disputes as to electoral votes, and twenty-one objections have been 
made to the electoral votes of different States, presenting a great variety of questions," 
though he did not elaborate. 17 CONG. REC. 815 (1886).

presidential election, see COUNTING ELECTORAL VOTES, supra note 3, at 9. 
27. U.S. CONST. art. II,§ 1, cl. 6 provides: 
In Case of the Removal of the President from Office, or of his Death, 
Resignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said Office, 
the Same shall devolve on the Vice President, and the Congress may by Law 
provide for the Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the 
President and Vice President, declaring what Officer shall then act as President, 
and such Officer shall act accordingly, until the Disability be removed, or a 
President shall be elected.  VP-R0000181_0014 
(2021-079) 
2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 1665 
The Act did a number of things with respect to presidential 
election. Sections 1 and 2 of the Act, pursuant to Article II, Section 1, 
Clause 4,28 established the time of choosing the electors by the States 
as thirty-four days before their meeting, and the day on which the 
electors were to give their votes as the first Wednesday in December 
of each presidential election year.29 Section 1 also clarified Article II, 
Section 1, Clause 230 by providing that each state shall appoint a 
number of electors equal to the number of Senators and 
Representatives to which the state is entitled at the time when the 
President and Vice President to be chosen would come into office.31 
Section 2 also clarified Article II, Section 2, Clause 332 by 
specifying the manner of certifying and transmitting the electoral 
certificates to the President of the Senate. It provided that the 
electors in each state shall make and sign three electoral certificates­
one to be sent by messenger appointed by a majority of the electors, a 
second by post to the President of the Senate, and the third to be 
delivered to the judge of the district in which the electors in each state 
With respect to presidential succession, the Act provided that, after the Vice President, 
the President pro tempore and the Speaker of the House of Representatives would next be 
in line to act as President. For a strong and persuasive claim that this mode of presidential 
succession is unconstitutional because Members of Congress are not "Officer[s]" within 
the meaning of the Presidential Succession Clause, see Akhil Reed Amar & Vikram David 
Amar, Is the Presidential Succession Law Constitutional?, 48 STAN. L. REV.113 (1995). 
28. See U.S. CONST. art. II, § 1, cl. 4 ("The Congress may determine the Time of 
chusing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be 
the same throughout the United States."). 
29. For the modem codification, see 3 U.S.C. § 1 (2000) ("The electors of President 
and Vice President shall be appointed, in each State, on the Tuesday next after the first 
Monday in November, in every fourth year succeeding every election of a President and 
Vice President"); id. § 7 ("The electors of President and Vice President of each State shall 
meet and give their votes on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December 
next following their appointment at such place in each State as the legislature of such State 
shall direct."). 
30. U.S. CONST. art. II,§ 1, cl. 2 provides: 
Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a 
Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and 
Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no 
Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under 
the United States, shall be appointed an Elector. 
31. A proviso to section 1 provided: "That where no apportionment of 
Representatives shall have been made after any enumeration, at the time of choosing 
electors, then the number of electors shall be according to the existing apportionment of 
Senators and Representatives." For the modem codification, see 3 U.S.C. § 3. 
32. See U.S. CONST. art. II, § 2, cl. 3 ("And they shall make a List of all the Persons 
voted for, and of the Number of Votes for each; which List they shall sign and certify, and 
transmit sealed to the Seat of the Government of the United States, directed to the 
President of the Senate.").  VP-R0000181_0015

shall assemble.33 Section 3 further specified the manner of certifying 
and transmitting the electoral certificates, but well beyond the text of 
Article II, Section 2, Clause 3. It provided that 
the executive authority of each State shall cause three lists of 
the names of the electors of such State to be made and 
certified and to be delivered to the electors on or before the 
said first Wednesday in December; and the said electors 
shall annex one of the said lists to each of the lists of their 
votes.34 
These provisions of sections 2 and 3 are noteworthy because the 
Electoral College Clauses do not expressly grant Congress the power 
to specify the manner of certifying or transmitting the electoral 
certificates. Interestingly, a draft of Article II, Section 1, Clause 4 at 
the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 provided that "[t]he Legislature 
may determine the time of choosing the Electors, and of their giving 
their votes; and the manner of certifying and transmitting their votes­
But the election shall be on the same day throughout the 
U-States. "35 The italicized language was inexplicably dropped by 
the time the Framers referred the draft Constitution to the 
Committee of Style and Arrangement.36 It is a slippery exercise to 
infer the meaning of this clause from language rejected in predecessor 
drafts. Perhaps the Framers intended to deny Congress the power to 
legislate on the manner of certification and transmission of electoral 
votes. Or perhaps the Framers intended that Congress could enact 
33. For the modern codification, see 3 U.S.C. § 11 and 3 U.S.C. § 9, which provides: 
The electors shall make and sign six certificates of all the votes given by them, 
each of which certificates shall contain two distinct lists, one of the votes for 
President and the other of the votes for Vice President, and shall annex to each 
of the certificates one of the lists of the electors which shall have been furnished 
to them by direction of the executive of the State. 
34. For the modem codification, see 3 U.S.C. § 6. 
35. See 2 THE RECORDS OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION OF 1787, at 529 (Max 
Farrand ed., 1911) [hereinafter FARRAND] (emphasis added); see also David P. Currie, 
The Constitution in Congress: The Second Congress, 1791-1793, 90 Nw. U. L. REV. 606, 
617-18 {1996) (noting this point). Alexander Hamilton's draft of the Constitution 
contained a broader grant of law-making power. See 3 FARRAND, supra, at 624 ("The 
Legislature shall by permanent laws provide such further regulations as may be necessary 
for the more orderly election of the President, not contravening the provisions herein 
contained."). 
36. Contrary to Professor Currie's view, see Currie, supra note 35, at 617-18, this 
language was not dropped by the Committee of Style, but was dropped by the Framers 
themselves. See 2 FARRAND, supra note 35, at 573 ( draft Constitution referred to 
Committee of Style and Arrangement) ("The Legislature may determine the time of 
chusing the Electors and of their giving their votes-But the election shall be on the same

these sections either pursuant to Article II, Section 1, Clause 4 itself 
or pursuant to the Necessary and Proper Clause.37 
In any case, it is difficult to see how section 3 and its modern 
codification at 3 U.S.C. § 6 are constitutional, strictly speaking. When 
section 3 of the Act of 1792 was read in the House of Representatives, 
Representative Niles, joined by Representative Hillhouse, objected to 
it on constitutional grounds, questioning Congress's ability to impose 
duties on the executive authority of each state and calling the section 
"degrading to the Executives of the several States."38 Speaker 
Sedgwick responded that "if Congress were not authorized to call on 
the Executives of the several States, he could not conceive what 
description of persons they were empowered to call upon,"39 and 
Representative Niles's motion to strike the clause was negatived. 
Democrat-Republican Senator Charles Pinckney, a Framer and 
leading delegate to the South Carolina ratifying convention, probably 
would have agreed with Representative Niles's constitutional 
objection. In a speech before the Senate in March of 1800, Senator 
Pinckney observed that the Act of 1792 may "in one or two 
particulars of no importance" go "farther than the Constitution 
warrants," though he did not identify any particular sections.40 In 
modem constitutional parlance, the duties imposed on State 
Executives by section 3 of the Act of 1792 and 3 U.S.C. § 6, do not 
seem quite like "purely ministerial reporting requirements,"41 but 
those who have a broader view of "executive commandeering" are 
unlikely to question seriously the constitutionality of section 3 of the 
Act of 1792 and 3 U.S.C. § 6.42 
Other provisions of the Act of 1792 are much less questionable. 
Section 4 provided that if the electoral certificate of a state shall not 
have been received at the Seat of Government by the first Wednesday 
in January, then the Secretary of State shall send a special messenger 
to the district judge of the State who held one of the three electoral 
37. These two possible fonts of power for the Electoral Count Act are discussed in

the second Wednesday in February for the purpose of opening the 
electoral certificates and counting the electoral votes.44 Section 6 
provided that if the President of the Senate were absent when the 
electoral certificates arrived, they would be given to the Secretary of 
State for safekeeping, to be delivered as soon as practicable to the 
President of the Senate. Section 7 provided for the compensation of 
messengers who would carry one of the three electoral certificates 
from each of the states to the Seat of Government at the rate of 
twenty-five cents a mile. Section 8 prescribed a $1,000 penalty (no 
small sum in those days) for messengers who failed to perform the 
service.45 
Whatever we think about the constitutionality of section 3 of the 
Act of 1792, the Act did not in any way assert any congressional 
control over the electoral count itself. As one early scholar of the 
Electoral Count Act noted, "There is no attempt here, legislatively, to 
interpret the Constitution, or devise any counting machinery other 
than that which appears on its face, or establish any rule for its action. 
43. The modem codification provides: 
When no certificate of vote and list mentioned in sections 9 and 11 of this title 
from any State shall have been received by the President of the Senate or by the 
Archivist of the United States by the fourth Wednesday in December, after the 
meeting of the electors shall have been held, the President of the Senate or, if he 
be absent from the seat of government, the Archivist of the United States shall 
request, by the most expeditious method available, the secretary of state of the 
State to send up the certificate and list lodged with him by the electors of such 
State; and it shall be his duty upon receipt of such request immediately to 
transmit same by registered mail to the President of the Senate at the seat of 
government.

It was assumed that the Constitution interprets itself, and executes 
itself by its own provisions."46 
2. The Grand Committee Bill of 1800 
In early 1800, the Federalist-controlled Sixth Congress attempted 
to regulate the electoral count.47 The impetus for the regulation was 
plainly corrupt: The upcoming presidential election between 
President and Federalist John Adams and Vice President and 
Democrat-Republican Thomas Jefferson commanded the nation's 
attention, and the Federalist-controlled Congress desired to deal Vice 
President Jefferson's electoral chances a "crippling blow."48 Historian 
John Bach McMaster explained that 
[t]he leaders of the [Federalist] party were determined that, 
if the presidential election could not be carried by fair 
means, it should by foul. Adams's electors might be 
defeated in the Legislatures and at the poles [sic], but the 
votes of the Jefferson electors should, if possible, be thrown 
out by Congress. With this for its purpose, an electoral­
count bill appeared in the Senate.49 
On January 23, 1800, Federalist Senator James Ross moved 
"[t]hat a committee be appointed to consider whether any, and what, 
provisions ought to be made by law for deciding disputed elections of 
President and Vice President of the United States, and for 
determining the legality or illegality of the votes given for those 
officers in the different States" and that the committee be authorized 
to report a bill.50 This motion was the subject of significant debate, 
much of which we shall uncover in Part II. On February 14, 1800, 
Senator Ross reported "A bill prescribing the mode of deciding 
disputed elections of President and Vice-President of the United

As its shorthand name suggests, this bill featured the 
appointment of a "Grand Committee" on the day before the second

Senators chosen by ballot in the Senate, and the Chief Justice of the

absent then the next most senior Justice would attend).53 This 
committee was to have power to examine, and finally to decide, all 
disputes relating to the election of President and Vice President 
including the:

and exceptions against corrupt, illegal conduct of the 
electors, or force, menaces, or improper means used to 
influence their votes; or against the truth of their returns, or 
the time, place or manner of giving their votes.54

52. Historian Albert Beveridge writes that the bill was "aimed particularly at the 
anticipated Republican presidential majority in Pennsylvania which had just elected a 
Republican Governor over the Federalist candidate." 2 BEVERIDGE, supra note 49, at 
463. It should come as no surprise that the losing Federalist candidate was Senator Ross 
of Pennsylvania, the principal proponent of the Grand Committee Bill. 
53. The idea for a committee of thirteen may have its roots in a proposal by Elbridge 
Gerry at the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 who proposed that, in case of electoral 
deadlock, "the eventual election should be made by six Senators and seven 
Representatives chosen by joint ballot of both Houses." 2 FARRAND, supra note 35, at 
514. This proposal failed by a vote of two to eight. Id. Note that Gerry's proposal 
decidedly favors the House of Representatives-the People's branch of the national 
legislature-both in committee representation and committee election given the joint 
ballot procedure. Under a joint ballot, the Members of the House of Representatives, at 
the founding, would be entitled to sixty-five of ninety-one votes. For a mathematical 
depiction of Gerry's thinking, see id. at 99 (proposing the selection of President by a 
randomly chosen subset of members of Congress taken together).

no petition, or exception, shall be granted, allowed, or considered by the sitting

number of votes given for an elector in any of the States, or the fact whether an 
elector was chosen by a majority of votes in his State or district."

electors.  VP-R0000181_0020

The committee was "to sit with closed doors." It was to have the 
"power to send for persons, papers, and records to compel the 
attendance of witnesses,"55 and its report was to be made "on the first 
day of March next after their appointment." This report was to be "a 
final and conclusive determination of the admissibility or 
inadmissibility of the votes given by the electors for President and 
Vice-President of the United States."56 
Republican Senator Charles Pinckney delivered a "closely 
reasoned attack"57 on the Grand Committee Bill, which occupies 
some twenty-one pages in the Annals of Congress.58 It is not 
surprising that Senator Pinckney led the effort in the Senate against 
the Grand Committee Bill. Some historians place him as the 
campaign manager in South Carolina for Democrat-Republican and 
Vice President Thomas Jefferson, who had everything to lose with the 
passage of the Grand Committee Bill. 
In his introductory remarks, Senator Pinckney described the 
Grand Committee Bill as more dangerous than the Alien and 
Sedition Acts of 1798 because, unlike the latter, the former was 
perpetual.59 Relying on his experience as a Framer and a leading 
delegate at the South Carolina ratifying convention, Senator Pinckney 
forcefully articulated his principal objection to the bill: 
Knowing that it was the intention of the Constitution to 
make the President completely independent of the Federal

Committee Bill, Senator Pinckney described it thus: 
[W]hat is the mode [of electing President] proposed by this bill? That the Senate 
and House of Representatives of the United States shall each of them elect six 
members, who with a chairman, to be appointed by the latter from a nomination 
of the former, would form a grand committee who should, sitting with closed 
doors, have a right to examine all the votes given by the Electors in the several 
States for President and Vice President, and all the memorials and petitions 
respecting them; and have power finally to decide respecting them, and to 
declare what votes of different States shall be rejected, and what admitted; and, 
in short, that this committee, thus chosen, and sitting with closed doors, shall 
possess complete, uncontrollable, and irrevocable power to decree, without 
appeal from their decision, who has been returned, and who shall be proclaimed 
President of the United States.

Pinckney's speech, it was not extemporaneous. See Ross & Josephson, supra note 7, at

Legislatures, I well remember it was the object, as it is at 
present not only the spirit but the letter of that instrument, 
to give to Congress no interference in, or control over the 
election of a President. It is made their duty to count over 
the votes in a convention of both Houses, and for the 
President of the Senate to declare who has the majority of 
the votes of the Electors so transmitted. It never was 
intended, nor could it have been safe, in the Constitution, to 
have given to Congress thus assembled in convention, the 
right to object to any vote, or even to question whether they 
were constitutionally or properly given. . . . To give to 
Congress, even when assembled in convention, a right to 
reject or admit the votes of States, would have been so gross 
and dangerous an absurdity, as the [F]ramers of the 
Constitution never could have been guilty of. How could 
they expect, that in deciding on the election of a President, 
particularly where such election was strongly contested, that 
party spirit would not prevail, and govern every decision?60 
According to Senator Pinckney, the animating principle of the 
Electoral College Clauses was to remove Congress from the business 
of electing the President as much as possible. Despite Senator 
Pinckney's strong and well reasoned objections, many of which we 
shall uncover in Part II, in the course of the argument against the 
constitutionality of the Electoral Count Act, the Senate passed the 
Grand Committee Bill by a "strict party vote"61 of sixteen to twelve 
on March 28, 1800.62 
Three days later the bill reached the House. In the House, 
Federalist Representative John Marshall-soon to be Chief Justice 
Marshall-broke with his party, and much to the Federalists' dismay, 
lobbied very hard against the Grand Committee Bill.63 He was 
60. 10 ANNALS OF CONG. 130. Senator Pinckney also observed that the Framers 
"well knew, that to give to the members of Congress a right to give votes in this election, 
or to decide upon them when given, was to destroy the independence of the Executive and 
make him the creature of the Legislature." Id. at 131. The potential for party spirit in 
Congress to dominate the choice of President was well recognized. In the Second 
Congress, Speaker of the House Sedgwick "descanted on the pernicious consequences 
which might result from the collision of parties, and the working of passions in the breasts 
of men whose ardor would probably be excited to the greatest degree" if the House of 
Representatives were to choose the President. 3 ANNALS OF CONG. 278 (1791). During 
the Wisconsin Incident of 1857, Senator Collamer made similar remarks. See COUNTING

appointed chairman of a select committee to redraft the bill. 
Marshall reported the Senate bill in the House of Representatives on 
April 25, 1800 with significant amendments.64 Under the amended 
bill, the committee's report was not to be the final and conclusive 
determination on the electoral votes. Instead, this determination 
would devolve upon the two Houses after receiving the committee's 
report. The House bill provided that, upon objection to any elector's 
vote in a joint meeting of the two Houses, the vote was to be counted 
unless the two Houses, meeting separately, concurred in rejecting it. 
Indeed, as we shall see, the Electoral Count Act bears significant 
resemblance to this amended bill.65 
These amendments "gutted" the Grand Committee Bill.66 The 
Senate considered this amended bill on May 8, 1800, and rejected the 
House amendments by a "strict party vote."67 The Senate then passed 
an amendment striking out the word "rejecting" and inserting the 
word "admitting." The effect of this change was to create a "one­
House veto" over electoral votes. When the two Houses could not 
agree on the amended bills, the bill died. 68 According to John 
Marshall scholar Albert J. Beveridge, if Marshall had not waged his 
campaign against the Grand Committee Bill, the election of Thomas 
Jefferson would have been impossible.69 
It is extremely difficult to see how the original Grand Committee 
Bill was constitutional.70 In addition to the constitutional argument 
that will be explored in detail in Part II, there are at least four 
additional attacks on this bill. First, what gives Congress the 
("Marshall worked the cloakrooms and corridors assiduously, voicing his objections and 
lining up the opposition vote.").

Senate, refused to accept a measure which would permit rejection by vote of the Senate 
alone."). 
69. 2 BEVERIDGE, supra note 49, at 456. Thomas Jefferson, for his part, was less than 
fully appreciative of John Marshall's efforts, suggesting that the Marshall amendments did 
not make the Grand Committee Bill constitutional. In a private letter, he wrote: 
Marshall made a dexterous manoeuver; he declares against the constitutionality 
of the Senate's bill, and proposes that the right of decision of their grand 
committee should be controllable by the concurrent vote of the two [H]ouses of 
[C]ongress; but to stand good if not rejected by a concurrent vote. You will 
readily estimate the amount of this sort of controul. 
Id. (quoting Letter from Thomas Jefferson, to Robert Livingston (Apr. 30, 1800)). 
70. The amended Grand Committee Bill largely parallels the Electoral Count Act.

authority to delegate the counting function to a committee, if 
Congress has counting authority at all?71 Second, what gives 
Congress the authority to take the Chief Justice (or other Justices) 
away from her judicial duties?72 Third, what gives Congress the 
authority to delay the counting of the electoral votes in violation of 
the immediacy principle of the Electoral College Clauses?73 Fourth, 
what gives Congress the authority to secretly count electoral votes in 
violation of the publicity principle of the Electoral College Clauses?74 
In sum, one should seriously doubt the constitutionality of the 
Grand Committee Bill. It is far from clear that Representative John 
Marshall's amendments removed the multiple constitutional 
infirmities. Arguably, the failure of the Second Congress to address 
congressional regulation of the electoral count after significant 
constitutional debate suggests the unconstitutionality of the Grand 
Committee Bill; Senator Pinckney certainly thought so.75 
71. Apparently, John Marshall also questioned Congress's ability to delegate 
authority to the Grand Committee. 2 BEVERIDGE, supra note 49, at 457 (citing Letter 
from Speaker Sedgwick, to Sen. Rufus King (May 11, 1800) ). 
72. The Constitution carefully circumscribes the Chief Justice's judicial duties under 
Article III, with one exception. See U.S. CONST. art. I, § 3, cl. 6 ("The Senate shall have 
the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on 
Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice 
shall preside .... "). 
It might be argued that the Chief Justice's role in the Grand Committee is quasi­
judicial and that the foregoing clause invites the Chief Justice to play a special role with 
respect to the Presidency. For an expression of this claim, see Amar, supra note 10, at 223 
n.16. Notably, however, the Framers rejected other non-judicial roles for the Chief Justice 
and other Justices of the Supreme Court. See, e.g., 2 FARRAND, supra note 35, at 75,298 
(rejecting participation in "[r]evisionary power" or veto power); id. at 342 (rejecting 
participation in "Council of State" or Privy Council).

74. See text accompanying infra notes 276-86. 
75. Senator Pinckney remarked: 
Were not the then Executive, and a number of the members of both Houses, 
members of the Convention which framed the Constitution; and if it intended to 
give to Congress, or to authorize them to delegate to a committee of their body, 
powers contemplated by this bill, could the Congress or the President of 1792, 
have been so extremely uninformed, and indeed ignorant of its meaning and of 
their duty, as not to have known it? 
10 ANNALS OF CONG. 136 (1800). However, it must be noted that, during the debate over 
the Act of 1792, Speaker of the House Sedgwick did mention the possibility of a 
"contested election" and "left it to the consideration of the Committee" to address the 
solution. See 3 ANNAI.S OF CONG. 279 (1791).  VP-R0000181_0024

2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 
3. The Twenty-second Joint Rule of 1865 1675 
The third principal congressional effort to regulate the electoral 
count came sixty-five years later in 1865.76 On January 30, 1865, the 
House of Representatives passed a resolution now commonly 
referred to as the "Twenty-second Joint Rule." A few days later, on 
February 6, 1865, after minor amendment, the Senate passed the 
House resolution. Sparsely attended Houses of Congress passed the 
Twenty-Second Joint Rule with no debate.77 As Dean Wroth has 
observed, it was "a political measure, passed and used by Republican 
majorities of both Houses to assure control over the votes of the 
recently rebellious southern states."78 The purpose of the Twenty­
Second Joint Rule was thus to exclude the electoral votes of putative 
states as needed, not to exclude the electoral votes of electors. It 
provided in relevant part: 
If, upon the reading of any such certificate by the tellers, any 
question shall arise in regard to counting the votes therein 
certified, the same, having been stated by the Presiding 
Officer, shall be submitted, first by the President of the 
Senate to that body, and then by the Speaker to the House 
of Representatives, and no question shall be decided 
affirmatively, and no vote objected to shall be counted, 
except by the concurrent votes of the two houses, said votes 
of the two houses to be reported to and declared by the 
Presiding Officer, and upon any such question there shall be 
no debate; and any other question pertinent to the object for 
which the two houses are assembled may be submitted and 
determined in like manner.79 
76. Three other interim and unsuccessful congressional efforts to regulate the 
electoral count deserve brief mention. First, on December 12, 1820, Senator Wilson 
submitted a resolution entitled Attempt to Remedy the Uncertainty as to Counting the 
Electoral Vote by Legislation. See COUNTING ELECTORAL VOTES, supra note 3, at 48. 
Second, on March 4, 1824, Senator Van Buren--soon to be President Van Buren in 
1837-reported a bill similar to Representative John Marshall's Grand Committee Bill. 
This bill passed the Senate on April 19, 1824, but died without having been considered by 
the House of Representatives. See id. at 57-60; see also Spear, supra note 18, at 158 
(describing the historical background); Wroth, supra note 22, at 327 (same). Third, on 
May 10, 1828, Representative Wilde moved a resolution entitled "A Proposition to Inquire 
into the Legality of the Certificates of the Votes of the Previous Presidential Election."

1676 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 80 
As the text of the Joint Rule indicates, "no vote objected to shall 
be counted, except by the concurrent votes of the two houses." Any 
Member of Congress could object to an electoral vote for any reason, 
and each House was to have a "one-House veto" as to which votes 
were to be counted.80 Thus, each House could, by rejecting enough 
votes, trigger a contingency election in the House of Representatives 
for the President and in the Senate for the Vice-President.81 As we 
shall see shortly, even the Electoral Count Act does not go this far. 
A report by the House Committee on Privileges and Elections in 
1874 called the Twenty-Second Joint Rule "the most dangerous 
contrivance to the peace of the nation that has ever been invented by 
Congress."82 Indeed, the consensus view during the Electoral Count 
Act debates was that the Twenty-Second Joint Rule was 
unconstitutional.83 Unsurprisingly, scholars who have studied the 
80. Sen. Morton offered an analysis: 
Under the rule as it now exists, when the votes for President and Vice-President 
are counted, any formal objection, no matter how trifling or insufficient or even 
contemptible in its character, has the effect to separate the two houses, and they 
are to vote upon this objection, and unless both houses concur in voting it down 
the electoral vote of that State is lost. In that way, by the dissent of either house, 
any State may be disfranchised; the vote of the State of New York or of Indiana 
may be rejected by the most foolish and trivial objection unless both houses shall 
concur in voting down that objection. The vote of every State may be rejected in 
this way. 
COUNTING ELECTORAL VOTES, supra note 3, at 444. 
81. A report by the Committee on Privileges and Elections in 1874 stated: "Here is a 
powerful temptation to the House of Representatives by non-concurrence to throw the 
election into its own body, and thus, perhaps, secure the election of a candidate who may 
have been overwhelmingly beaten at the polls." COUNTING ELECTORAL VOTES, supra

rule."); id. (remarks of Sen. Bayard) ("I have for a long time been of opinion that the 
constitutionality of this rule altogether may well be doubted."); id. at 472 (remarks of Sen. 
Bayard) ("That such a rule was without constitutional warrant, I cannot doubt; and I do

dangerously unconstitutional."); id. at 540 (remarks of Sen. Maxey) ("It is a blot upon the 
mode and manner of counting the votes of the electoral college. It gives to either [H]ouse 
of Congress the right to stab to the death a sovereign State of this Union."). Sen. Bayard 
remarked: 
Then, under the maleficent working of a rule adopted without regard to the 
Constitution, under the assumption of powers utterly unwarranted by the two 
[H]ouses of Congress, there came the assumption of a veto power by either 
branch of Congress, in silence, without debate, without reason, to throw out the 
electoral vote and disfranchise one or more communities at will.

Rule have identified it as the apex of congressional control over the 
electoral count.84 Simply put, the Twenty-second Joint Rule was 
unconstitutional.85 
4. The Electoral Count Act of 1887 
The legislative history of the Electoral Count Act of 1887 is 
complex, and much of this history has been well catalogued 
elsewhere.86 The heart of the Electoral Count Act is currently 
codified at 3 U.S.C. § 15, titled "Counting electoral votes in 
Congress."87 This section sets forth a complicated set of provisions 
for counting electoral votes. 
Two noticeable differences exist between the Electoral Count 
Act and the Twenty-second Joint Rule. First, the Electoral Count 
Act is a law and not a joint rule. Second, the Electoral Count Act 
does not have the "one-House veto" provision of the Twenty-second 
Joint Rule. It is not clear that these two significant changes cure the 
constitutional infirmities of the Twenty-second Joint Rule. 
Charting the basic workings of the Electoral Count Act is a good 
place to begin. The Act provides for the reading of the electoral 
votes by state and the objection to an electoral vote. Unlike its 
predecessors, the Electoral Count Act requires an objection to an 
electoral vote to have the signature of at least one Senator and at 
least one Representative.88 After all the objections to the electoral 
votes from a state have been received and read, the Senate and the 
House of Representatives withdraw for separate deliberations. 
84. See Tansill, supra note 22, at 522 ("In 1865, the climax of congressional control 
[over the electoral vote] was reached, .... "); Wroth, supra note 22, at 328 ("Congress 
asserted total power over the electoral vote with the adoption of the Twenty-second Joint 
Rule in 1865. "). 
85. The "one-House veto" of the Twenty-second Joint Rule bears a remarkable 
resemblance to the scheme held unconstitutional in INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 959 
(1983) (holding a "one-House veto" provision unconstitutional). 
86. In a nutshell, the precursor bill to the Electoral Count Act was introduced in the 
Republican Senate in May 1878. "Spurred by two close presidential elections, the Senate 
repassed the bill three times in the next decade, but each time could not win the 
agreement of the House." Wroth, supra note 22, at 334 (footnotes omitted). The two 
Houses of Congress finally agreed in 1887, after "the passions of Reconstruction had 
cooled." Id. For a comprehensive summary of the legislative history of the Electoral 
Count Act, see Ross & Josephson, supra note 7, at 722-30, and Wroth, supra note 22, at

1678 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 80 
Unless there is a case of "double returns," the applicable provision is 
as follows: 
[N]o electoral vote or votes from any State which shall have 
been regularly given by electors whose appointment has 
been lawfully certified to according to section 6 of this title 
from which but one return has been received shall be 
rejected, but the two Houses concurrently may reject the 
vote or votes when they agree that such vote or votes have 
not been so regularly given by electors whose appointment 
has been so certified.89 
In the case of "double returns" with "more than one return or 
paper purporting to be a return from a State,"90 the applicable 
statutory provision is considerably more complex. The joint 
convention first looks to see if the state has determined the 
controversy, and if it has, that determination is binding.91 If, however, 
there should be multiple state authorities which claim to have decided 
the controversy, then the two Houses of Congress, acting separately, 
must decide concurrently which set to count. If the two Houses 
disagree, then the Electoral Count Act provides that "the votes of the 
electors whose appointment shall have been certified by the executive 
of the state, under the seal thereof, shall be counted."92 The Electoral 
Count Act does not address what happens if the same executive 
authority certifies different electors or if multiple executive 
authorities certify different electors.

contest concerning the appointment of all or any of the electors of such State, by 
judicial or other methods or procedures, and such determination shall have been 
made at least six days before the time fixed for the meeting of the electors, such 
determination made pursuant to such law so existing on said day, and made at 
least six days prior to said time of meeting of the electors, shall be conclusive, 
and shall govern in the counting of the electoral votes as provided in the 
Constitution, and as hereinafter regulated, so far as the ascertainment of the 
electors appointed by such State is concerned.

the course of two hundred and thirteen years of the Republic. There 
have been a dozen or so problems of the electoral count and 
consequent challenges to electoral votes, almost all of which occurred 
in the nineteenth-century. This section summarizes the historical 
problems of the electoral count. 
1. The Massachusetts Incident of 1809 
The first congressional objection to the votes of electors occurred 
in the electoral count of 1809.94 On December 26, 1808, 
Representative Barker introduced a memorial from some disgruntled 
inhabitants of Hanover, Massachusetts that the appointment of 
Massachusetts electors was "irregular and unconstitutional"95 relative 
to the Massachusetts Constitution, and praying that Congress look 
into the matter during the electoral count. When a resolution was 
called to appoint a committee of the House to investigate, 
Representative Randolph spoke in very strong terms against it: 
He said it appeared to him that, under color of redress of 
grievances, the resolution might go in a very alarming and 
dangerous manner to enlarge the sphere of action of the 
General Government at the expense of the dearest rights of 
the States. In what manner, asked he, is the General 
Government constituted? We, as one of the branches of the 
Legislature, are unquestionably the judges of our own 
qualifications and returns. The Senate, the other branch of 
the Legislature, is in like manner the judge without appeal of 
the qualifications of its own members. But with respect to 
the appointment of President on whom is that authority 
devolved in the first instance? On the electors, who are to 
all intents and purposes, according to my apprehension, as 
much the judges of their own qualifications as we are of 
ours .... 96 
Representative Rowan also spoke strongly against the resolution. 
He thought that "Congress did not possess a superintending power 
over the acts of the States in general cases" and doubted that 
Congress had any power in this case; he recommended that the 
petitions of the Massachusetts citizens not be placed on the files of 
the House "because they related to a subject on which the House had 
no power to legislate."97 The resolution passed nevertheless, but

there is no record that anything further was done. No one objected 
during the electoral count, and all Massachusetts electoral votes were 
counted. 
2. The Indiana Incident of 1817 
The second congressional objection to the votes of electors 
occurred in the electoral count of 1817.98 On February 11, 1817, the 
two Houses gathered in the House of Representatives. During the 
electoral count, Representative Taylor, "compelled" to speak "by his 
sense of duty,"99 objected to the counting of the electoral votes from 
Indiana because the Indiana electors were elected before Indiana 
joined the Union. The Speaker of the House interrupted him and 
stated that, when assembled in joint convention, the two Houses 
"could consider no proposition, nor perform any business not 
prescribed by the Constitution."100 Accordingly, the Senate withdrew 
to its chamber by their unanimous consent. Representative Taylor 
then repeated his argument that, because the Indiana electors were 
chosen before Indiana was admitted into the Union, "the votes of that 
State were no more entitled to be counted than if they had been 
received from Missouri or any other Territory of the United 
States."101 In his view, the votes of the Indiana electors were 
"illegal."102 
Although Representative Taylor did not refer to it, the improper 
appointment of the Indiana electors was in violation of section 1 of 
the Act of 1792. However, the votes of Indiana's electors were cast 
after Indiana was admitted into the Union. Indiana was admitted into 
the Union as the nineteenth State effective December 11, 1816. This 
date was after the date set by Congress for the meeting of the 
electoral colleges but before the date set by Congress for the electoral 
count. 
Representative Cady countered. He 
thought that the matter had been settled by the admission of 
Senators and Representatives from Indiana to their seats, 
and that it was too late on that account to question her right 
to participate in the election of President; and that from the 
moment the constitution of the State was assented to, she

was entitled to all the privileges of an independent member 
of the Union.103 1681 
A joint resolution to settle the question was indefinitely 
postponed by the House of Representatives.104 The Senate re-entered 
the House Chamber and the electoral count resumed. According to 
the record of congressional debate, "[n]o one appeared to question 
the power of Congress to reject the vote of Indiana if that State was 
not a State in the Union at the time the electoral votes were cast."105 
In the end, the votes of Indiana's three electors were counted. 
3. The Missouri Incident of 1821 
The third congressional objection to the votes of electors 
occurred in the electoral count of 1821.106 In early February of 1821, 
Congress passed a resolution appointing a joint committee "to 
ascertain and report a mode of examining the votes for President and 
Vice-President of the United States, and of notifying the persons 
elected of their election."107 On February 13, 1821, the Senate 
resolved that if any objection was made to the electoral votes of 
Missouri and if the result of the electoral count did not turn on 
counting or omitting the Missouri votes, then the President of the 
Senate would announce the winners of the presidential and vice 
presidential electoral vote, plus a conditional tally-that is to say, if 
Missouri's votes were counted, the tally would be x; if Missouri's 
votes were not counted, the tally would bey. In the Senate, a "long 
debate" took place on this resolution and four Senators strongly 
opposed it "principally for the reason that it was not competent in the 
Senate to decide such a question in anticipation."108 
When the resolution was read in the House of Representatives, 
Representative Randolph stated he would rather have seen no votes 
counted at all than a "special verdict" announced: 
103. Id. 
104. Id. When Representative Sharp offered the joint resolution, Representative 
Bassett objected, stating that the resolution should not be joint because a joint resolution 
might establish a precedent which would "deprive [the] House of one of its powers, by 
permitting the Senate to participate in this question." Id. at 47. There is no record of any 
Representative supporting this erroneous view. There is no textual reason to conclude 
that the House has judicial power during the electoral count but that the Senate does not, 
or vice versa.

He could not recognize in this house or the other house, 
singly or conjointly, the power to decide on the votes of any 
State. . . . He maintained that the electoral college was as 
independent of Congress as Congress of them; and we have 
no right, said he, to judge of their proceedings. . . . Suppose 
a case, in which some gentlemen of one house or the other 
should choose to turn up his nose at the vote of some State, 
and say that if it be so and so, such a person is elected; and if 
so and so, what-you-call-'im is elected-did not everybody 
see the absurdity of such a proposition ?109 
Representative Floyd also objected to the special verdict. He stated, 
If they had any power over the votes of Missouri at all, it 
was when her votes were first received; but no such power 
existed. He protested against this assumption of authority 
on the part of Congress, and wished to show his 
disapprobation of the resolution in the strongest manner.11° 
Representative Rhea agreed, finding that the Constitution was 
not designed to be expedient and that "it was not in the power of this 
House, or of both Houses, by resolution, to remedy a defect in the 
Constitution. "111 
Soon afterwards, during the electoral count, Senator Livermore 
objected to the electoral votes from Missouri because Missouri was 
not a State of the Union. He was right. Missouri was admitted into 
the Union as the twenty-fourth State effective August 10, 1821. In 
the House, Representative Floyd submitted a resolution "[t]hat 
Missouri is one of the States of this Union, and her votes for 
President and Vice-President of the United States ought to be 
received and counted."112 
After extended comments by Representatives Randolph and 
Archer against the resolution on the ground that it was not within the 
power of the House, a motion to table the resolution passed, and the 
Senate reassembled in the House Chamber for the electoral count.113 
The President of the Senate proceeded to announce the result of the 
vote conditionally, as provided in the Senate resolution: 
The whole number of electors appointed by the several 
States was 235. One elector in each of the States of 
Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Mississippi having died before 
the meeting of the electoral college of which he was a

member, made the whole number of votes actually cast 232, 
including the vote of Missouri, of which 117 make a 
majority; or, excluding the vote of Missouri, 229, of which 
115 make a majority; but in either event James Monroe is 
elected President, and Daniel D. Tompkins, Vice­
President.114 1683 
When Representative Floyd asked the President of the Senate if 
Missouri's votes were in fact counted, the joint convention broke into 
disorder. Representative Randolph tri.ed to speak but was 
pronounced out of order by the Speaker of the House. The President 
of the Senate concluded and the Senate withdrew to its Chamber.U5 
Thereafter, Representative Randolph introduced two resolutions 
in the House declaring that the electoral count was illegal. The first 
resolution provided that the electoral votes of Missouri were counted. 
The second resolution provided 
[ t ]hat the whole number of electors appointed, and of votes 
given for President and Vice-President, has not been 
agreeably announced by the presiding officer of the Senate 
and House of Representatives, agreeably to the provision of 
the Constitution of the United States, and that therefore the 
proceeding has been irregular and illegal.116 
As he was putting his resolutions into writing, the House voted to 
adjourn and did not act upon either resolution.117 
4. The Postmaster and Michigan Incidents of 1837 
The fourth congressional objection to the votes of electors 
occurred during the electoral count of 1837.118 The electoral count of 
1837 actually involved two separate incidents: the Postmaster 
Incident and the Michigan Incident. In late January of 1837, the 
Senate and the House of Representatives resolved to appoint a joint 
committee "to ascertain and report a mode of examining the votes of 
President and Vice President of the United States, and of notifying 
114. Id. at 50. As this pronouncement makes clear, the electoral count of 1821 is 
unique for another reason: this was the first (and only) time when electors who were 
appointed died before the meeting of the electoral colleges. It appears that the President 
of the Senate miscalculated the number necessary for a majority of the votes. The 
Electoral College Clauses provide that the needed majority be "a majority of the whole 
number of Electors appointed." U.S. CONST. amend. XII (emphasis added); see U.S. 
CONST. art. II, § 1, cl. 3. Thus, the correct majority was either 116 or 118 votes, depending 
on the exclusion or inclusion of Missouri.

the persons of their election."119 Senator Grundy, who was one of 
three Senators on the joint committee, reported to the Senate on 
February 4, 1837 that some electors may have been constitutionally 
ineligible to be electors because "no Senator or Representative, or 
Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, 
shall be appointed an elector."120 He reported that Isaac Waldron, an 
elector from New Hampshire, was the "president of a deposit-bank at 
Portsmouth, and was appointed and acting as pension-agent, without 
compensation, under the authority of the United States" and the two 
North Carolina electors held the "offices of deputy postmasters under 
the General Government."121 In addition, the appointment of three 
other electors (from New Hampshire, Connecticut, and North 
Carolina, respectively) was in question.122 The Committee concluded 
that the Electoral Incompatibility Clause "excludes and disqualifies 
deputy postmasters from the appointment of electors; and the 
disqualification relates to the time of the appointments, and that a 
resignation of the office of deputy postmaster after his appointment 
as elector would not entitle him to vote as elector under the 
Constitution. "123 
The Senate took no further action on the issue. Debate in the 
House of Representatives was minimal. One Representative pointed 
out that all of these electors probably resigned from their offices 
before the day on which they cast their votes,124 but was quickly 
corrected by another who noted that the ineligibility under the 
Electoral Incompatibility Clause extended to the time of the 
appointment.125 These issues were not raised during the electoral 
count, and all of these electoral votes were counted. 
The Michigan Incident was similar to the Indiana and Missouri 
Incidents. Michigan was admitted into the Union as the twenty-sixth 
State effective January 26, 1837. This date was after the date 
Congress set for the meeting of the Electoral Colleges, but before the 
date Congress set for the counting of electoral votes. On February 4, 
1837, the Senate proposed a resolution to count Michigan's electoral 
votes in the same manner as Missouri's. Senator Norvell objected to

this resolution, arguing that the Michigan question was exactly the 
same as that of the Indiana Incident.126 
Senator Calhoun also opposed the resolution, stating that 
"Michigan was a State de facto at the time she formed her 
constitution; and if her electors were not legally appointed, neither 
were her Senators, who were admitted upon this floor."127 The Senate 
adopted this resolution by a vote of thirty-four to nine.128 The House 
adopted the same resolution on February 6, 1837, although 
Representative Crary of Michigan also "thought the position of his 
State was analogous to that of Indiana, and that her vote should be 
received and counted."129 
On February 8, 1837, the President of the Senate announced the 
result of the electoral count in the same way as in the Missouri 
Incident. Martin Van Buren of New York was declared the 
President-elect.130 If Michigan's votes were counted, he had 170; if 
not, he had 167 votes. In either event, Martin Van Buren had a 
majority of the whole number of electors appointed. However, a 
different situation presented itself in the case of the Vice President­
elect. Richard M. Johnson of Kentucky had the most electoral votes. 
If Michigan's votes were counted, he had 147 votes; if not, he had 144 
votes. In either event, he did not have the requisite majority to be the 
Vice President-elect, and thus, the choice devolved upon the 
Senate.131 The Senate elected Johnson as Vice President. 
5. The Wisconsin Incident of 1857 
The fifth congressional objection to the votes of electors 
occurred during the electoral count of 1857.132 In the election of 1856, 
the five electors of the State of Wisconsin did not cast their votes on 
the day prescribed by federal law because of a snowstorm.133 The 
President of the Senate counted Wisconsin's electoral votes over the 
objections of both Representatives and Senators assembled in 
126. Id. at 72 (remarks of Sen. Norvell). Senator Lyon agreed and "contended that 
Michigan was as much entitled to count her vote as was the State of Indiana." Id. Senator

convention.134 When Representative Lechter objected to Wisconsin's 
electoral votes and moved to exclude them, the presiding officer ( the 
President of the Senate) simply stated that no debate was in order 
when the votes were being read by the tellers or even after they were 
finished.135 When Senator Crittenden then asked the presiding 
officer, "Do I understand the Chair to decide that Congress, in no 
form, has power to decide upon the validity or invalidity of a 
vote?,"136 the presiding officer replied that it was his constitutional 
duty to announce the result of the electoral count and that "[w]hat 
further action may be taken, if any further action should be taken, 
will devolve upon the properly-constituted authorities of the country­
the Senate or House of Representatives, as the case may be."137 
While the final result did not turn on the decision to count 
Wisconsin's electoral votes, several Members of Congress were 
concerned that the decision to count Wisconsin's electoral votes 
would set a dangerous precedent.138 According to Senator Pugh, 
unlike the Missouri Incident which was "never likely to happen 
again," the Wisconsin Incident "may occur one hundred times again, 
if the Government should stand that many years."139 Senator 
Crittenden made the point that the electoral votes of Wisconsin were 
not really "votes" at all, by stating: "Here is a vote tendered us from 
a State given on another day. We call it a vote in common parlance; 
but in the constitutional sense is it a vote at all? Is it not merely null? 
Unquestionably, it seems to me, it is null and void."140 This statement 
attracted considerable support. Almost every Member of Congress 
who spoke on the subject agreed that the votes of Wisconsin should 
not have been counted.141

urged that Wisconsin's votes should be counted because the people of Wisconsin ought 
not to be disenfranchised because of an "accident" of their agents. His cry was very much 
one of substance over form. See id. at 119. Senator Houston argued that any resolution 
that Wisconsin's votes should not have been counted was unconstitutional. In his view, 
the electoral count of 1857 was "good, constitutional, and lawful." Id. at 122-23.  VP-R0000181_0036

Ultimately, resolutions were introduced in each House of 
Congress that Wisconsin's electoral votes were null and void and 
ought not to have been included in the electoral count, but these 
resolutions failed.142 
6. The Greeley Incident and the Other Incidents of 1873 
The sixth congressional objection to the votes of electors 
occurred during the electoral count of 1873.143 In the election of 1872, 
three Georgia electors cast votes for Horace Greeley of New York. 
Greeley had died after the November popular election but before the 
electors met in the electoral colleges. These three electors voted for 
Greeley anyway, feeling bound by the wishes of their constituents. 
Senator Hoar objected to these three votes and stated that they could 
not be counted because Greeley was not a "person" within the 
meaning of the Constitution when the electors voted.144 
Representative Banks objected on the basis that "we have no power 
to decide on the eligibility of any man voted for for President."145 The 
question of whether to count these votes was a very close one. The 
House voted 101 to 99 (with forty not voting) not to count the 
Greeley votes.146 The Senate voted forty-four to nineteen to count 
them.147 Because the two Houses did not concur, the Greeley votes 
were not counted pursuant to the Twenty-second Joint Rule.148 
The electoral count of 1873 presented at least three other 
important challenges to electoral votes. First, two objections were 
made to Mississippi's electoral votes. The Mississippi electors did not 
certify that they voted by ballot.149 One of the electors from that 
state, A.T. Morgan, was absent and the electors appointed an 
alternate, J.J. Spellman. Spellman's appointment was not signed by 
the Governor of Mississippi as required by the laws of that state.150 
The House and the Senate voted to count all Mississippi electoral 
votes, including Spellman's.151

meeting of the electoral colleges, and the pledged electors voted for someone else. See 
115 CONG. REC. 148 (1969) (remarks of Rep. McCulloch).

1688 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 80 
Second, Senator Morton objected to Georgia's votes for a 
different reason. Apparently two votes were cast for Charles J. 
Jenkins of Georgia for President, and five votes for Alfred H. 
Colquitt of Georgia for Vice President.152 This vote distribution 
revealed a mathematical certainty: at least one of the electors from 
that State had violated the constitutional requirement that he vote for 
at least one person who is not an inhabitant of his State.153 Because 
the objection was made after the electoral votes from Georgia were 
read, the Chair decided that it came too late and no decision was 
made on this objection.154 
Third, two objections were made to Texas's electoral votes. The 
executive authority of Texas had failed to certify that its electors were 
properly appointed. Moreover, four of the electors (less than a 
majority of those elected) themselves appointed four persons to take 
the place of four elected, but absent, electors.155 Nonetheless, both 
the House and the Senate voted to count all of Texas's electoral 
votes.156 
7. The Hayes-Tilden Incident of 1877 
The seventh and most important objection to the votes of 
electors occurred during the electoral count of 1877-the "never 
again" incident that directly led to the passage of the Electoral Count 
Act roughly a decade later. Undoubtedly, the electoral count of 1877 
is the most objectionable electoral count in history, having been 
described by one of our leading scholars as "the most violent, 
fraudridden, and tumultuous in history."157 
In 1876, Democrat Samuel J. Tilden squeaked out a majority of 
the total number of popular votes for President, defeating Republican 
Rutherford B. Hayes by just 250,000 votes.158 Hayes, however,

claimed a one-vote majority of the electoral votes with 185 votes to 
Tilden's 184. The problem was that rival Republican and Democratic 
state governments in three states-Florida, Louisiana, and South 
Carolina-each had sent rival electoral certificates to Congress, 
presenting the standard case of "double returns" from these states.159 
After mediation failed, Congress created an "Electoral 
Commission" to resolve the disputed double returns from these 
states.160 This Commission was to consist of fifteen persons: five 
Senators, five Representatives, and five Justices of the Supreme 
Court. As ought to be apparent, the Commission has some very eerie 
similarities to the Grand Committee of 1800. The plan was to appoint 
seven Republicans and seven Democrats; the fifteenth person would 
be a Justice of the Supreme Court picked by the other four "partisan" 
Justices. Justice David Davis, an Independent, initially received the 
nod to be this fifteenth person, but he declined the offer after the 
Illinois Legislature appointed him to fill a vacancy in the Senate. 
Justice Joseph P. Bradley, a Republican, then received the thankless 
job.

n.46 ( collecting other sources). 
159. There was a problem with one electoral vote from Oregon as well: one of the 
Oregon electors for Hayes was a postmaster, and was therefore ineligible to the office of 
elector, see U.S. CONST. art. II, § 1, cl. 2. Oregon's Democratic Governor, refusing to 
certify the electoral certificate, struck the name of the postmaster-elector for Hayes and 
substituted that of an elector for Tilden, who received the next most votes. This account is 
briefly recollected in Harrison, supra note 23, at 700 n.2 ( citing ARI HOOGENBO0M, THE 
PRESIDENCY OF RUTHERFORD B. HA YES 30-31 (1988)). 
160. During the Electoral Count Act debates, at least one Senator noted that the 
Electoral Commission of 1877 was constitutionally suspect, though he noted that it was "a 
wise solution to a great difficulty." See 17 CONG. REC. 817 (1886) (remarks of Sen. 
Sherman). In his book on Reconstruction, Professor Bruce Ackerman calls this Electoral 
Commission "extraconstitutional." 2 BRUCE ACKERMAN, WE THE PEOPLE: 
TRANSFORMATIONS 247 (1998). Perhaps this is a clever attempt to avoid calling it 
"unconstitutional." Other scholars have firmly taken the position that the Electoral 
Commission was unconstitutional. I agree. See, e.g., Harrison, supra note 23, at 700 n.3 
("Under now-current separation of powers doctrine the commission was almost certainly 
unconstitutional. Its members exercised significant government power but were not 
appointed consistently with the Appointments Clause, as Buckley v. Valeo says they 
should have been.") (citation omitted); Tribe, supra note 17, at 278 & n.438. Professor 
Tribe states: 
Today, of course, the service on such a body by members of Congress would be 
understood to violate the separation of powers as construed by Buckley v. Valeo, 
and the reservation of a veto power in Congress acting by anything less than full 
legislation presented to the President for signature or veto would be understood 
to violate the nonparliamentary structure of our government.

any, now possessed ... by the two Houses."161 The Commission was 
only to have jurisdiction over the cases of double returns; objections 
to electoral votes in cases of single returns would be handled as later 
provided by the Electoral Count Act ( the two Houses, meeting 
separately, would need to concur to reject a vote). The decisions of 
the Commission, like that of the Grand Committee, were to be final, 
but with one exception: the two Houses could overturn the decision 
of the Commission if they so concurred.162 
Given the political composition of the Commission, it is not 
surprising that the Commission secured a victory for Hayes. In each 
case of double returns, the Commission voted eight to seven to count 
the votes of the Republican electors by a strict party vote, with Justice 
Bradley casting the decisive vote in each case. This perceived 
partisanship had huge political costs. The Democrats controlled the 
House of Representatives and threatened a filibuster to delay the 
counting of electoral votes. A constitutional crisis loomed: if no 
President was elected by March 4, 1877, then the Presidential 
Succession Clause might kick in.163 
The famous "Compromise of 1877," announced on March 1, 
1877, served to avert this crisis. Southern Democrats would proceed 
with the formal counting of the electoral votes, allowing Republican 
Hayes to be elected President, but would extract several substantial 
concessions from him. Among other things, congressional 
Republicans, speaking for Hayes, agreed to cease federal military 
support for the Reconstruction governments of the South, sealing the 
end of Reconstruction. The upshot of the Hayes-Tilden Incident is 
that Hayes became President although he was the clear loser in the 
popular vote and the likely loser of the electoral vote.164

2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 1691 
8. The Hawaii Incident of 1961 
The eighth congressional objection to the votes of electors 
occurred during the electoral count of 1961.165 This incident, 
involving the validity of the electoral certificate(s) of Hawaii, was the 
most significant problem of the electoral count of the twentieth 
century, and the one most relevant given recent history. 
The initial election results in Hawaii showed Republicans 
Richard M. Nixon and Henry Cabot Lodge as the ,vinners of the 
popular vote for President and Vice President. A slate of Nixon­
Lodge electors was appointed on November 16, 1960, certified by the 
acting Governor of Hawaii on November 28, 1960. A recount was 
ordered to begin on December 13, 1960. On December 19, 1960, a 
slate of Nixon-Lodge electors cast their votes for President and Vice 
President.166 This electoral certificate was previously certified by the 
Acting Governor of Hawaii.167 However, on December 19, 1960, a 
slate of Kennedy-Johnson electors also cast their votes for President 
and Vice President, without any previous certification from the 
executive authority of Hawaii.168 On December 30, 1960, the Circuit 
Court of the First Judicial Circuit of the State of Hawaii determined 
that the Kennedy-Johnson electors won the popular vote in Hawaii.169 
A few days later, on January 4, 1961, the newly-elected Governor of 
Hawaii certified the electoral certificate of the Kennedy-Johnson 
electors.170 The Administrator of General Services received this 
certification on January 6, 1961-the day of the electoral count. 
During the electoral count, President of the Senate Richard 
Nixon stated that "[t]he Chair has received three certificates from 
persons claiming to be the duly appointed electors from the State of 
Hawaii."171 These three certificates were (1) the Nixon-Lodge 
electoral certificate of December 19, 1960, certified by the executive 
authority of Hawaii as of November 28, 1960; (2) the Kennedy­
Johnson electoral certificate of December 19, 1960; and (3) the 
Kennedy-Johnson electoral certificate of December 19, 1960, certified 
by the newly-elected executive authority of Hawaii as of January 4, 
1961.172 After these three electoral certificates were opened and read,

Nixon stated that "[t]he Chair has knowledge, and is convinced that 
he is supported by the facts" that the third electoral certificate 
"properly and legally portrays the facts" with respect to the popular 
election in Hawaii.173 Accordingly, he stated that 
[i]n order not to delay the further count of the electoral vote 
here, the Chair, without the intent of establishing a precedent, 
suggests that the electors named in the certificate of the 
Governor of Hawaii dated January 4, 1961, be considered as 
the lawful electors from the State of Hawaii.174 
No one objected and all three of Hawaii's electoral votes were 
counted.175 
9. The Bailey Incident of 1969 
The ninth and most recent congressional objection to the votes of 
electors occurred during the electoral count of 1969.176 It was well 
known before the joint convention convened for the purposes of the 
electoral count that Dr. Lloyd W. Bailey, a Republican elector from 
North Carolina, had been "faithless" in giving his two electoral 
votes--instead of following the popular vote for Richard M. Nixon 
for President and Spiro Agnew as Vice President, Dr. Bailey voted 
for George C. Wallace for President and Curtis Lemay as Vice 
President. The Governor of North Carolina certified the state's 
electoral certificate with knowledge of Dr. Bailey's faithlessness. 
A few days before the electoral count, some Senators, led by 
Senator Muskie (who was then running for Vice President), 
introduced a memorandum in the Senate recommending that Dr. 
Bailey's vote be rejected, and that it be recast in accordance with the 
popular vote in North Carolina.177 This memorandum announced the 
authors' intention to object to the vote of North Carolina on January 
6, 1969.178 During the electoral count on January 6, 1969, 
Representative O'Hara objected to the electoral votes of North 
173. Id. at 290. 
174. Id. (emphasis added). 
175. The result of the electoral count did not even come close to turning on the legal 
status of Hawaii's three electoral votes. Democrats Kennedy and Johnson prevailed in the 
electoral count by a margin of eighty-four votes. See id. at 291.

Carolina and presented a written objection signed by him and Senator 
Muskie in which thirty-seven Representatives and six Senators 
joined.179 The objection proposed simply that Dr. Bailey's vote be 
rejected (and not recast in accordance with the popular vote in North 
Carolina).180 
The debate in each House of Congress was extensive, with over 
forty Representatives and over twenty-five Senators speaking on the 
objection. The House of Representatives debated the objection for a 
full two hours-the maximum time allowed by the Electoral Count 
Act. The rationale in the House for sustaining the objection and 
rejecting Dr. Bailey's vote was mixed. Some Representatives argued 
that only Congress could check faithless electors.181 Representative 
Edmondson stated that the "power of Congress to count the electoral 
vote" is "the only constitutional power specifically granted to 
anybody [sic] or agent to protect the electoral system against arbitrary 
or unlawful action to thwart the popular will of the people of the 
States in electing the President of the United States."182 Other 
Representatives argued that Dr. Bailey's faithless vote was not 
"regularly given" within the meaning of the Electoral Count Act.183 
Yet others rested their justification to sustain the objection on more 
lofty constitutional arguments of "one man, one vote"184 and 
"justice. "185 
The Representatives who spoke against the objection were more 
unified. They argued that Congress had no power not to count Dr. 
Bailey's faithless vote because that power was not within the meaning 
of the Electoral Count Act,186 or because Congress had no such power 
under the Constitution.187 Representative Rarick put the latter point 
best: 
179. See id. at 146. 
180. See id. 
181. See, e.g., id. at 147 (remarks of Rep. Wright) (stating that Congress has "the legal 
and constitutional power, and indeed the duty, to prevent faithless electors from 
corrupting the election of a President"); id. at 158 (remarks of Rep. Corman) (stating that 
"Congress sits as a court of last resort"); id. at 170 (remarks of Rep. O'Hara) ("Only the 
Congress can see to it that the elector respects his obligations .... ").

186. See, e.g., id. at 151 (remarks of Rep. Anderson) (arguing that Electoral Count Act

Fish).

1694 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 80 
Under the Constitution and our oath of office we, as 
Congressmen, are not election supervisors nor given 
discretion to recompute the vote received from a sovereign 
state. The Constitution clearly proscribes our duty as "to 
count the electoral votes," the ministerial function of a 
central collecting agency and a tabulating point.188 
Ultimately, the House of Representatives voted to reject the 
objection, but not by an overwhelming margin. The vote was 170 to 
228, with thirty-two not voting and four not yet sworn.189 Among the 
Representatives voting for the objection were future Presidents 
George H.W. Bush and Gerald R. Ford.190 The Senate debate was 
similar but briefer. Ultimately, the Senate also voted to reject the 
objection not by an overwhelming margin. The vote was thirty-three 
to fifty-eight, with seven not voting and two live pair.191 Because both 
Houses of Congress did not vote to sustain the objection and reject 
Dr. Bailey's vote, the vote was counted. 
II. THE ARGUMENT AGAINST THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE 
ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 
In Part I, we examined the principal congressional efforts to 
regulate the electoral count. The fact that Congress did not pass the 
Electoral Count Act until 1887, and only after several failed attempts 
to enact legislation regulating the counting of electoral votes is 
(perhaps surprisingly) of minimal consequence in assessing the 
constitutionality of the Electoral Count Act.192 The better clue relates 
independent under the Electoral College Clauses and concluding that Congress could not 
"tamper" with Dr. Bailey's vote). Representative Poff argued that 
[i]f the Congress can look behind the solemn certificate of the Chief Executive of 
a State, reject that certificate and by a simple majority vote decide what electoral 
votes were "regularly given" and which were given irregularly, then the Congress 
can expropriate from the people their power to elect their President. 
Id. at 157; see also id. at 162 (remarks of Rep. Henderson) (arguing that Congress's role is 
like a local board of elections whose "function is solely to receive the votes, count them, 
and certify the result ... not to determine whether votes were properly cast"); id. at 164 
(remarks of Rep. Eckhardt) (stating that it was "beyond question in the Constitution ... 
that the joint session of the House and the Senate has no power whatsoever other than to 
hear the returns of the electors read"); id. at 166-67 (remarks of Rep. Fountain) (calling 
Congress "powerless").

190. For Representative Gerald Ford's statement in support of the objection, see id. at 
163-64. 
191. Id. at 246. 
192. The converse is not true. See, e.g., Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U.S. 957, 980 (1991) 
(opinion of Scalia, J.) (stating that "[t]he actions of the First Congress ... are of course 
persuasive evidence of what the Constitution means") ( citations omitted); Powell v.  VP-R0000181_0044 
(2021-079) 
2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 1695 
not to timing, but to tone. As we saw somewhat in Part I and as we 
shall see in more detail in this Part, the constitutionality of legislation 
regulating the counting of electoral votes was controversial from the 
start. In particular, the constitutionality of the Electoral Count Act 
was considered and debated by several Congresses that considered 
such legislation in the Reconstruction Era. This level of extended 
debate should raise a red flag as to the possible unconstitutionality of 
the Electoral Count Act. 
An "interpretivist" resolution of the constitutionality of the 
Electoral Count Act must, however, be based on arguments from 
constitutional text and structure. This Part sets forth these two 
arguments. The textual argument carefully parses the words of the 
Electoral College Clauses, and shows how the Electoral Count Act 
clashes with the Constitution. In addition, the textual argument, 
unlike conventional "clause-bound" textual arguments, examines the 
text of the Constitution as a coherent whole, invoking a host of other 
clauses, in order to squeeze yet additional meaning from the Electoral 
College Clauses, and shed additional light on the unconstitutionality 
of the Electoral Count Act. The structural argument identifies a 
number of structural principles of the Constitution that relate to 
presidential election and to legislation, and shows how the Electoral 
Count Act violates these principles. 
Anyone who wishes to argue that the Electoral Count Act is 
constitutional bears a high burden of proof, in light of the arguments 
presented, and in light of the asymmetry of constitutional proofs. In 
order to prove that a statute is unconstitutional, one need only find 
one reason why a statute is unconstitutional, whereas in order to 
prove that a statute is constitutional, one must defend a statute 
against all possible constitutional attacks and find that there is no 
possible reason why a statute is unconstitutional.193 There is more 
than one reason why the Electoral Count Act is unconstitutional. 
McCormack, 395 U.S. 486, 547 (1969) ("[T]he precedential value of these cases tends to 
increase in proportion to their proximity to the Convention in 1787."); Wisconsin v. 
Pelican Ins. Co., 127 U.S. 265,297 (1888) (stating that an act "passed by the first Congress 
assembled under the Constitution, many of whose members had taken part in framing that 
instrument, ... is contemporaneous and weighty evidence of its true meaning"). Even 
then. however, a statute is only presumed to be constitutional. 
193. This part presents, in my view, many if not most of the arguments against the 
constitutionality of the Electoral Count Act. There may be others.  VP-R0000181_0045

1696 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW 
A. The Textual Argument 
1. Some Basics: Who, What, When, and Where? [Vol. 80 
The relevant clause of the Twelfth Amendment provides that 
"[t]he President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and 
House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall 
then be counted. "194 Careful parsing of these twenty-seven words 
yields surprisingly rich clues into the mode and manner of the 
electoral count. These words and the rest of the Twelfth Amendment 
(and their counterparts in the original Constitution) are, not 
surprisingly, woefully understudied.195 As Professors Levinson and 
Young recently put it, "[t]he Twelfth Amendment is a Rodney 
Dangerfield of the Constitution: it gets no respect."196 At the same 
time, these words of the Twelfth Amendment are incredibly 
important in assessing the constitutionality of the Electoral Count 
Act: the Constitution is supreme to conflicting federal statutory 
law.197 In order to determine whether the Electoral Count Act is 
constitutionally permissible, we must examine the Constitution itself. 
This sub-section addresses the following five basic questions 
relating to counting electoral votes: (1) Who is the presiding officer 
of the electoral count? (2) Who opens the electoral certificates and 
counts the electoral votes? (3) What is counting and what is to be 
counted? (4) When is the counting done? (5) Where is the counting 
done? 
a. Who Is the Presiding Officer of the Electoral Count? 
The relevant clause of the Twelfth Amendment provides that 
"[t]he President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and 
194. U.S. CONST. amend. XII. The only differences between the text of the Twelfth 
Amendment and the text of the original Constitution are in punctuation and 
capitalization. See U.S. CONST. art. II, § 1, cl. 3. 
195. No full-scale law review article dissects the text of the Twelfth Amendment. Two 
recent articles explore the so-called "Habitation Clause" of the Twelfth Amendment 
which provides that Electors must not vote for a President and Vice President of the same 
state as themselves. U.S. CONST. amend. XII ("The Electors shall meet in their respective 
states and vote by ballot for President and Vice-President, one of whom, at least, shall not 
be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves; .... "); see James C. Ho, Much Ado 
About Nothing: Dick Cheney and the Twelfth Amendment, 5 TEX. REV. L. & POL. 227 
passim (2000); Sanford Levinson & Ernest A. Young, Who's Afraid of the Twelfth 
Amendment?, 29 FLA. ST. U. L. REV. 925, 932-54 (2001).

House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall 
then be counted."198 This clause does not explicitly answer the 
question of who is the presiding officer during the electoral count.199 
Because the President of the Senate is the only named individual in 
the clause, it may be tempting to conclude that the President of the 
Senate is the presiding officer of the electoral count, but this is far 
from clear. There are three possibilities with respect to the President 
of the Senate: (1) the President of the Senate shall be the presiding 
officer of the electoral count; (2) the President of the Senate may be 
the presiding officer of the electoral count; and (3) the President of 
the Senate shall not be the presiding officer of the electoral count. 
As a textual matter, nothing in the clause suggests that the 
President of the Senate shall be the presiding officer of the electoral 
count.200 As a structural matter, the President of the Senate is the 
presiding officer of the Senate, not the presiding officer of the joint 
convention of Senators and Representatives ( or the joint assemblage 
of the Senate and House of Representatives), which needless to say is 
not the Senate. It seems only logical that there must be a presiding 
officer of the electoral count. Every parliamentary body needs a 
presiding officer in order to function smoothly.201 What then is the 
answer to the constitutional question? 
If historical practice is any guide, the President of the Senate or 
the President pro temp ore shall be ( or at least may be) the presiding 
officer of the electoral count. One of these two officers has been the 
presiding officer of every electoral count since the beginning of the 
Republic-before and after the adoption of the Electoral Count Act. 
Not surprisingly, 3 U.S.C. § 15 provides that 
Congress shall be in session on the sixth day of January 
succeeding every meeting of the electors. The Senate and 
House of Representatives shall meet in the Hall of the 
House of Representatives at the hour of 1 o'clock in the 
198. U.S. CONST. amend. XII. 
199. This simple point was not lost during the Electoral Count Act debates. See, e.g., 
17 CONG. REC. 865 {1886) (remarks of Sen. Morgan) ("We frequently hear it stated that 
the President of the Senate is the president of the joint meeting. If he is, it is only by 
reason of some rule or agreement between the two Houses. The Constitution is silent 
upon that point. The Constitution speaks of no officer who is to preside over the joint 
meeting."). 
200. But see COUNTING ELECTORAL VOTES, supra note 3, at 541 (remarks of Sen. 
Maxey) ("By the Constitution [the President of the Senate] is the presiding officer over 
the joint assemblage of the Senate and the House."). 
201. Cf. 17 CONG. REC. 865 (remarks of Sen. Morgan) {discussing presiding officer of

afternoon on that day, and the President of the Senate shall 
be their presiding officer.2m 
This unbroken historical practice is entitled to great weight in 
constitutional interpretation.203 
This is not to say, however, that historical practice necessarily 
settles the meaning of the Electoral College Clauses. The text of the 
Constitution is the first-best and hence authoritative source of 
constitutional meaning, not extra-textual sources of constitutional 
meaning. To the extent that the text of the Constitution is clear, it 
may not be trumped by extra-textual history. The Electoral College 
Clauses are not quite as ambiguous as they may appear when we read 
the Constitution as a coherent whole. Although it may seem bizarre, 
it may be downright unconstitutional for the President of the Senate 
to be the presiding officer of the electoral count upon a closer reading 
of the text of the Constitution.204 
No less than the Office of President of the United States is at 
stake during the electoral count. Likewise, no less than the Office of 
President of the United States is at stake during presidential 
impeachment. Yet, with respect to the latter, the Senate 
Impeachment Clause carefully provides that "[w]hen the President of 
the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside," not the 
President of the Senate.205 Should the electoral count be any different 
when no less may be at stake? 
The Senate Impeachment Clause demonstrates that the Framers 
were quite sensitive to the obvious conflict of interest problem when 
they focused on it.206 To be sure, the Framers did not focus on the 
202. 3 U.S.C. § 15 (2000) (emphasis added). 
203. See, e.g., Walz v. Tax Comm'n, 397 U.S. 664, 678 (1970) (stating that "an unbroken 
practice ... is not something to be lightly cast aside" in constitutional interpretation); The 
Pocket Veto Case, 279 U.S. 655, 689 (1929) (stating that a "[!Jong-settled and established 
practice is a consideration of great weight in a proper interpretation" of the Constitution); 
cf. Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U.S. 783 (1983) (holding that legislative prayer, which began in 
the First Congress, is constitutional). 
204. This statement may be surprising, but I ask the reader to suspend his or her 
skepticism. 
205. U.S. CONST. art. I, § 3, cl. 6. But this clause is not nearly as careful as it should 
be-the Framers forgot to specify that the Vice President cannot preside at her own 
impeachment trial, leaving the matter to necessary implication. For thoughtful 
commentaries, see Joel K. Goldstein, Can the Vice President Preside at His Own 
Impeachment Trial?: A Critique of Bare Textualism, 44 ST. LOUIS U. L.J. 849 (2000);

similar but less obvious conflict of interest problem when drafting the 
Electoral College Clauses. But the Framers did seem to understand 
and appreciate the general conflict-of-interest problem. When the 
Framers discussed direct presidential election by Congress, they 
considered and agreed to a joint ballot procedure that would require 
a majority of Senators and Representatives who are present 
considered together, in lieu of one that would require the concurrence 
of the two Houses of Congress voting separately.207 James Wilson, 
supporting the joint ballot procedure, suggested that the Senate might 
have a conflict of interest problem, remarking that "as the President 
of the Senate was to be the President of the U-S. that Body in cases 
of vacancy might have an interest in throwing dilatory obstacles in the 
way, if its separate concurrence should be required."208 If this interest 
were true of the Senate, it would be particularly true of the Vice 
President. 
More generally, the founders likely understood that the Vice 
President would oftentimes be a candidate for President or Vice 
President in the next election. During the Electoral Count Act 
debates, Senator Hoar, discussing the mood at the founding, stated: 
The President of the Senate would almost always be and 
would be expected to be one of the chief candidates for the 
presidential office. He would have been one of the two 
principal candidates four years before, and it was the fashion 
of those days very much more than of these to continue the 
same person in public trusts and in political candidacy, and 
several times in our history the Vice-President of the United 
States has succeeded to the Presidency, Adams to 
Washington, Jefferson to Adams, Van Buren to Jackson.209 
Even if the Framers and Ratifiers of the original Constitution did 
not understand that the Vice President would be a candidate for 
President or Vice President in the next election, the Framers and 
Ratifiers of the Twelfth Amendment-which overwrote the relevant 
WILLIAM RAWLE, A VIEW OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF 
AMERICA 206 (1825) ("As the vice president succeeds to the functions and emoluments of 
the president of the United States whenever a vacancy happens in the latter office, it 
would be inconsistent with the implied purity of a judge that a person under a probable 
bias of such a nature, should participate in the trial, and it would follow that he

1700 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 80 
provision of the original Constitution-understood the conflict-of­
interest problem well, especially given the imbroglio of the electoral 
count of 1801 where Vice President and presidential candidate 
Thomas Jefferson not only presided over the electoral count but also 
assumed the counting function.210 It is thus possible to say that the 
conflict-of-interest principle applies to the Twelfth Amendment if not 
to the original Constitution. 
There is no evidence from the Electoral College Clauses that the 
President of the Senate shall be the presiding officer of the electoral 
count. In the absence of such evidence, the Senate Impeachment 
Clause supplies a strong argument that the President of the Senate 
shall not be the presiding officer of the electoral count. The 
difference-and perhaps the constitutionally significant difference­
between presidential impeachment and counting electoral votes may 
be that the Vice President necessarily has a conflict of interest in the 
former because the Vice President is to act as President,211 whereas 
the Vice President does not necessarily have a conflict of interest in 
the latter because the Vice President may or may not be a candidate 
in the next presidential or vice presidential election. Nevertheless, 
the better reading of the Electoral College Clauses, when read in light 
of the Senate Impeachment Clause and of conflict-of-interest 
principles generally, is that the Vice President, the President of the 
Senate, shall not be the presiding officer of the electoral count.212 The 
Electoral Count Act may be unconstitutional for this reason alone.213 
210. See supra note 3 and text accompanying infra note 230. 
211. See U.S. CONST. art. II, § 1, cl. 6; U.S. CONST. amend. XXV, § 1. 
212. An interesting question arises whether a Senator or Representative-who may 
also be a presidential or vice presidential candidate-may be the presiding officer of the 
electoral count, even though the Vice President shall not be. The better answer is "Yes." 
Before opening the electoral certificates and inspecting the electoral votes, the identities 
of the presidential or vice presidential candidates are (at least theoretically) unknown, and 
hence it would be impossible to know which Senators or Representatives to exclude from 
the presiding officer's chair. The argument is that the Constitution implicitly assumes that 
the Vice President-more than any other person present at the electoral count-would be 
a presidential or vice presidential candidate, and hence makes the Vice President uniquely 
ineligible to be the presiding officer. As a prudential matter, of course, the presiding 
officer should be someone who is not known to be a presidential or vice presidential 
candidate. 
213. There is one more reason why the "Presiding Officer Clause" of 3 U.S.C. § 15 may 
be unconstitutional. That clause provides that "the President of the Senate shall be their 
presiding officer." 3 U.S.C. § 15 (2000) (emphasis added). What gives Congress the 
authority to super-add to the Vice President's duties specified by the Constitution? See, 
e.g., U.S. CONST. art. I, § 3, cl. 4 ("The Vice President of the United States shall be 
President of the Senate, but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally divided."); U.S. 
CONST. art. II, § 1, cl. 6 ("In Case of the Removal of the President from Office, or of his 
Death, Resignation or Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said Office, the  VP-R0000181_0050 
(2021-079) 
2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 1701 
If the President of the Senate shall not be the presiding officer of 
the electoral count, who then is the presiding officer? The answer to 
this question is simpler than it appears: One of the Senators and 
Representatives then and there present at the electoral count. Each 
parliamentary body has, almost by definition, the right to choose its 
presiding officer and other officers from one of its own, at least in the 
absence of any explicit declaration to the contrary.214 Whether 
Congress may exercise this choice on behalf of the joint convention of 
Senators and Representatives is an entirely different question, and 
one to be discussed later.215 
b. Who Opens the Electoral Certificates and Counts the 
Electoral Votes? 
With respect to who does the opening of electoral certificates 
and the counting of electoral votes, the relevant clause of the Twelfth 
Amendment provides that "[t]he President of the Senate shall, in the 
presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the 
certificates and the votes shall then be counted."216 The critical 
question to ask is whether the counting function belongs to the 
President of the Senate or to the Senate and House of 
Representatives. The interpretive stakes are high: If the counting 
function belongs to the President of the Senate, the Electoral Count 
Act is unconstitutional because it vests the counting function in the 
two Houses of Congress, and under the Constitution, Congress may 
not strip the President of the Senate of her constitutional duty.217 
Same shall devolve on the Vice President .... "); U.S. CONST. amend. XXV, § 1 (similar); 
U.S. CONST. amend. XII ("The President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate 
and House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall then be 
counted."). If Congress may add to the Vice President's duties, why not the President's 
duties or the Chief Justice's duties? If "shall" means "must," the Presiding Officer Clause 
of the Electoral Count Act would seem to be, strictly speaking, unconstitutional. 
214. Compare U.S. CONST. art. I, § 2, cl. 5 ("The House of Representatives shall chuse 
their Speaker and other Officers."), and U.S. CONST. art. I, § 3, cl. 5 ("The Senate shall 
chuse their other Officers, and also a President pro tempore, in the Absence of the Vice 
President, or when he shall exercise the Office of President of the United States."), with 
U.S. CONST. art. I,§ 3, cl. 4 ("The Vice President of the United States shall be President of 
the Senate, but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally divided."). 
215. See infra notes 498-525 and accompanying text.

217. Others have made this obvious point. See, e.g., 17 CONG. REC. 1059 (1886)

the Senate and that the Necessary and Proper Clause "does not confer on Congress the 
power to assume unto itself the duty which the Constitution imposes on that officer"); 18

1702 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 80 
We begin with the first part of the clause: "The President of the 
Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of 
Representatives, open all the certificates."218 It is clear that the 
opening of the certificates function belongs to the Vice President, 
who is the President of the Senate.219 The Constitution provides no 
wiggle room: the President of the Senate shall open all the 
certificates, not some.220 
or transfer to any other person or officer that power and duty."); Paulsen, supra note 205, 
at 245 (noting that each House of Congress may not use the Rules of Proceedings Clause 
to strip the Vice President of constitutional duties); Spear, supra note 18, at 156 ("The 
Constitution says that 'the votes shall then be counted,' and if this mandate be addressed 
to the President of the Senate, that ends the question so far as the counting is concerned. 
The Constitution has then trusted him with the whole power, and any legislation to direct 
him, would be an impertinent intrusion upon his prerogative."); cf Harrison, supra note 
23, at 703 ("Neither House nor Senate is given any authority over the President of the 
Senate when it comes to opening the certificates, and Congress by statute may no more 
control the exercise of this constitutionally granted authority than it may tell the President 
whom to pardon."). 
218. U.S. CONST. amend. XII. 
219. See U.S. CONST. art. I, § 3, cl. 4 ("The Vice President of the United States shall be 
President of the Senate, but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally divided."). It does 
appear that the President pro tempore acted in place of the Vice President in at least the 
electoral counts of 1809, 1825, 1857, 1877, and most recently 1969 when Vice President 
Hubert H. Humphrey "recused" himself from the electoral count. 
220. There is the rather tricky question whether the President of the Senate must open 
all certificates in a case of multiple returns from the same state, as in the Hayes-Tilden 
incident of 1887, or in a case of a return from a putative state (say for example, a 
certificate from Puerto Rico). The best answer is that the opening-of-the-certificates 
function contains no power of discretion because any discretion in the opening of 
certificates would interfere with the counting-of-electoral-votes function. Translated into 
the recent past: if two certificates had come from Florida during the electoral count of 
2001, the Vice President could not, constitutionally speaking, have refused to open both of 
them. 
In a recent essay, Professor Harrison takes a contrary view on the specific 
question of multiple (putative) electoral certificates. In his view, "[t]he certificates that 
the President of the Senate is to open, however, are those of the electors, not those of non­
electors. Hence in order to know which certificates to open, the President of the Senate 
must know which of competing slates of electors were validly appointed." Harrison, supra 
note 23, at 702-03. This is a clever (and obvious) textual argument. He continues: "If the 
Twelfth Amendment is assumed to be a dispute resolution mechanism, a natural reading 
of it thus indicates that in one especially important context the dispute is to be resolved by 
a single individual." Id. at 703. The vice of this reading, as Professor Harrison 
acknowledges, is that one person has the power to resolve at least one kind of dispute in 
presidential election, a conclusion that is generally to be avoided. Indeed, he 
acknowledges in his very next paragraph that "[i]t would be much easier to believe that 
this important decision was vested in a collective body, were there not serious problems 
with the operation of the collective body, the joint session of Congress {if it is to be called 
that)." Id. Notwithstanding the latter "problems" (which are overstated in my view), 
Professor Harrison ignores the point that in the case of multiple putative electoral 
certificates, the opening of the certificates function interferes with the counting-of­
electoral-votes function. The former enables the latter; the former is more of an  VP-R0000181_0052 
(2021-079) 
2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 1703 
The counting function is, however, noticeably ambiguous: "[t]he 
President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House 
of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall then be 
counted." There are two plausible readings of this oddly phrased text 
employing the passive voice.221 The counting function may be read as 
one vested in the President of the Senate, or jointly in the Senate and 
House of Representatives.222 If the President of the Senate is to count 
the votes, the clause easily could have been written to provide that 
"[t]he President of the Senate shall ... open all the certificates and 
"exercise" whereas the latter is more of a "function." Moreover, the former is simply less 
important than the latter-a President and Vice President elect are determined after the 
electoral votes are actually counted, not when the electoral certificates are opened. The 
better answer, I submit, is that the President of the Senate has discretion in the opening­
of-electoral-certificates function only if she also has the counting-of-electoral-votes 
function, and even then, that discretion would follow as a matter of the latter function, not 
the former. 
This scenario of multiple putative electoral certificates was the subject of 
discussion during the Electoral Count Act debates, given the cases of double returns in the 
electoral counts of 1873 and 1877. For statements that the President of the Senate has no 
discretion in opening the certificates in the case of multiple returns, see, for example, 
COUNTING ELECTORAL VOTES, supra note 3, at 446-47 (remarks of Sen. Bayard); id. at 
449-50 (remarks of Sen. Thurman). But see id. at 454 (remarks of Sen. Morton) (arguing 
that President of the Senate's discretion in opening certificates "shows the necessity for an 
amendment of the Constitution"). 
221. "The famous phrase of the Constitution 'the votes shall then be counted' has been 
like an apple of discord almost since the beginning of Government." J. HAMPDEN 
DOUGHERTY, THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM OF THE UNITED STATES 254 (1906); see also 
Albert J. Rosenthal, The Constitution, Congress, and Presidential Elections, 67 MICH. L. 
REV. 1, 27 (1968) (noting that the passive voice of this phrase breaks one of the "cardinal 
rules of draftsmanship"); Tribe, supra note 17, at 279 ("The Framers should have listened 
to the time-honored injunction to avoid the passive voice. 'Shall be counted'-by 
whom'?"). 
During the Electoral Count Act debates, Representative Herbert carefully 
examined the grammar of this patch of constitutional text: 
Here is a duty imposed upon the President of the Senate. He shall, in the 
presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open the certificates. 
Then the first person is dropped and the third person is taken up; there the 
sentence changes its construction; there the duty imposed upon the President of 
the Senate ceases, and afterwards a new part of speech is used-the third person 
is adopted, and a verb relating to a noun in the third person, "the votes," 
employed, and a new duty imposed by the words, "and the votes shall then be 
counted." 
18 CONG. REC. 75 (1886). 
222. The ambiguity is well-evidenced in the congressional debate over the electoral 
count. See, e.g., COUNTING ELECTORAL VOTES, supra note 3, at 48 (remarks of Sen. 
Wilson) ("It is not said who shall count the votes, nor who shall decide what votes shall be 
counted."); id. at 451 (remarks of Sen. Frelinghuysen) ("So when the Constitution says the 
vote shall be counted, it says that a decision shall be made by some one, and it must be 
made either by the presiding officer of the Senate or by the Senate and House, who are 
required to be present."); see also Spear, supra note 18, at 156 (noting a similar point).  VP-R0000181_0053 
(2021-079) 
1704 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 80 
shall then count the votes."223 If the Senate and House of 
Representatives are to count the votes, the clause easily could have 
been written to provide that "[t]he President of the Senate shall, in 
the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all 
the certificates and the votes shall then be counted by the Senate and 
House of Representatives."224 
The text does not equally support these two plausible readings 
once we escape a narrow "clause-bound" interpretivism. When read 
in light of the conflict-of-interest principle of the Senate 
Impeachment Clause, the better answer ( again, but by no means an 
unassailable one) is that the counting function of the Electoral 
College Clauses is vested in the Senate and House of Representatives, 
not the President of the Senate. To be sure, the Constitution does not 
explicitly address how the Senate and House of Representatives is to 
exercise the counting function-by the two Houses acting separately 
223. This obvious point was made during the Electoral Count Act debates. See, e.g., 18 
CONG. REC. 46 (remarks of Rep. Dibble). 
224. These are the two most obvious readings, but there are at least four other 
readings. A third reading is that the Clause is simply silent as to who shall count the votes 
and that Congress may specify the counting agent. 
A fourth reading, suggested by Representative Dibble during the Electoral Count 
Act debates, is that the counting function is split between the House of Representatives 
and the Senate: the House is to count the presidential votes and the Senate the vice 
presidential votes, because, in case of deadlock, the House chooses the President and the 
Senate the Vice President. See 18 CONG. REC. 46. There is no textual or historical 
support whatsoever for this reading. Moreover, this reading would have been impossible 
before the adoption of the Twelfth Amendment which required Electors to cast separately 
marked votes for President and Vice President, and it is unlikely that the Twelfth 
Amendment added to the evident textual ambiguity. 
A fifth reading, suggested by Senator Thompson during the electoral count of 
1857, makes even less sense. He suggested that the counting function is vested solely in 
the Senate, with the House only present as witnesses. See, e.g., COUNTING ELECTORAL 
VOTES, supra note 3, at 126 ("The Constitution, in my judgment, is that these votes are to 
be returned to us and counted by us, and the House of Representatives are admitted to be 
present at the count to prevent a combination, a clandestine operation, a secret session, a 
coup d'etat."); id. at 130 ("When we are counting the votes, (for the President of the 
Senate only counts them in his official capacity, and in the session of the Senate, because 
he cannot count them as a private individual,) it is improper for the House members to be 
anything but listeners."); id. at 136 ("The members of that House of Representatives are 
to sit by, and whether we put them in the gallery, or the reporters' desks, or in niches­
wherever they are placed they are to look on."). 
Finally, a sixth reading, suggested by Senator Call in 1876, is equally nonsensical. 
He suggested that the counting function is vested solely in the House of Representatives, 
because the Constitution vests in that body the duty to choose the President in case there 
is no winner in the Electoral College mode of presidential election, see U.S. CONST. 
amend. XII, and only that body may determine whether there is such a winner. See 17 
CONG. REC. 1061 (1886); see also id. at 1019 (remarks of Sen. Hoar) (acknowledging and 
dismissing as incorrect this view of the counting function).  VP-R0000181_0054

2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 1705 
in their corporate capacities, or by the two Houses acting conjointly 
as one "House" of Senators and Representatives.225 In addition, 
when we consider early state constitutions,226 we see that early state 
constitutions did not vest the counting of electoral votes in any one 
person.227 
225. The Constitution only requires that the Senate and House of Representatives, as 
separately organized bodies, be present as witnesses for the opening of electoral 
certificates and (probably) the counting of electoral votes (to the extent that the "in 
presence of the Senate and House of Representatives" phrase modifies the counting 
phrase, "the votes shall then be counted," see infra notes 278-86 and accompanying text), 
but does not address whether the counting of electoral votes is to be done by the Senate 
and House of Representatives as such or by Senators and Representatives on a per capita 
vote basis (equivalent to the Senate and House of Representatives voting by joint ballot). 
Other scholars have noted similar points. See, e.g., Tribe, supra note 17, at 279 ("Is any 
such [counting] authority reposed instead in one or another House, or in the two Houses 
acting concurrently, or in the two Houses acting as a single organ even though not 
precisely as the Congress of the United States?"); and Harrison, supra note 23, at 703. 
Professor Harrison states: 
How is the joint session [of the Senate and House of Representatives] to make 
decisions? The Constitution provides no explicit rule, and certainly does not 
indicate that the House and Senate are to be put together into one body that will 
act by majority vote. Rather, the two chambers appear to retain their separate 
identities: the certificates are to be opened in the presence, not of the Senators 
and Representatives, but of the Senate and the House. 
Id. For various textual and largely structural reasons, I conclude that the counting of 
electoral votes is to be done by joint ballot of Senators and Representatives. See infra 
notes 291-313 and accompanying text (discussing unicameralism principle); infra notes 
429-45 and accompanying text ( discussing anti-Senate principle of presidential election); 
infra notes 526-53 and accompanying text ( discussing Chadha principle of law-making).

the Constitution, see THE FEDERALIST No. 47, at 271-76 (James Madison) (Clinton 
Rossiter ed., Mentor 1999) (1961) (surveying the early state constitutions in discussing the

227. During the Electoral Count Act debates, Senator Hoar made this point, though he 
did not cite specific provisions from early state constitutions. See 17 CONG. REC. 1019. 
For specific provisions, see, for example, the constitutions of the following states:

1706 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 80 
The history, however, undercuts these fundamental textual and 
structural considerations. The Framers clearly thought that the 
counting function was vested in the President of the Senate alone. In 
a unanimous resolution attached to the final Constitution, the 
Framers described the procedures for electing the first Chief 
Executive, recommending in relevant part "that the Senators should 
appoint a President of the Senate, for the sole Purpose of receiving, 
opening and counting the Votes for President."228 The records of the 
First Congress confirm this construction. On April 6, 1789, Senator 
John Langdon was elected as President of the Senate "for the sole 
purpose of opening and counting the votes for President of the 
United States."229 This early practice should be of limited 
precedential value, however, because they relate to the creation of 
the Government of the United States before a President and Vice 
President were ever elected. 
The dangers of this initial construction soon appeared when 
Presidents of the Senate were also candidates for President or Vice 
President. In the electoral count of 1797, President of the Senate 
John Adams purportedly counted "improper votes" from Vermont, 
MASS. CONST. OF 1780, pt. 2, ch. 1, § II, art. II. Also Massachusetts: 
Those persons who shall be qualified to vote for Senators and 
Representatives ... shall ... give in their votes for a Governor to the Selectmen, 
who shall preside at such meetings; and the Town Clerk, in the presence and with

votes, and form a list of the persons voted for, with the number of votes for each

for the election of the executive authority by the legislature (for example, Georgia, North

{for example, New York) did not address the counting of such votes. See, e.g., GA.

and in the electoral count of 1801, President of the Senate Thomas 
Jefferson purportedly counted dubious electoral votes from 
Georgia.230 By 1800, some members of the Senate of the Sixth 
Congress interpreted the counting language as vesting the counting 
function in the "members composing" the Senate and the House of 
Representatives,231 and to the extent there is any difference, Senator 
Pinckney interpreted the counting language as vesting the counting 
function in "Congress."232 
The Twelfth Amendment, adopted in 1804, did not resolve the 
textual ambiguity between the first two readings of the counting 
function. In fact, it contains language identical to that found in 
Article II, Section 1, Clause 3. However, as Dean Wroth has 
suggested, it is arguable that, with the later precedents, the Twelfth 
Amendment changed the original understanding of the counting 
function, shifting this function from the President of the Senate to the 
Senate and House of Representatives.233 But early commentators on 
230. See Tansil!, supra note 22, at 516; Wroth, supra note 22, at 326 n.23; see also 
COUNTING ELECTORAL VOTES, supra note 3, at 116 (remarks of Sen. Reid) ("It has often 
happened that the Vice-President is a candidate for re-election; and we can scarcely 
suppose that the Constitution intended to confer on him the power of declaring himself 
elected by the votes he may count, without an appeal from his decision."). For more on 
the history of self-counting, see COUNTING ELECTORAL VOTES, supra note 3, at 533 
(remarks of Sen. Morton) (presenting history of self-counting in 1797, 1801, 1821, 1837, 
1841, and 1861); Harrison, supra note 23, at 703 n.12 (providing more examples). 
231. See 10 ANNALS OF CONG. 120 (1800). The bill stated: 
And the constitution of the United States having directed that "the President of 
the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, 
open all the certificates, and that the votes shall then be counted," from which 
the reasonable inference and practice has been, that they are to be counted by the 
members composing the said Houses, and brought there for that office, no other 
being assigned them; and inferred the more reasonably, as thereby the 
Constitutional weight of each State in the election of those high officers is exactly 
preserved in the tribunal which is to judge of its validity: the number of Senators 
and Representatives from each State, composing the said tribunal, being exactly 
that of the Electors of the same State ....

is made their [Congress's] duty to count over the votes in a convention of both Houses, 
and for the President of the Senate to declare who has the majority of the votes of the 
Electors so transmitted.") (emphasis added). Indeed, there is an important difference 
between the "Congress" and the "Senate and the House of Representatives." The word 
"Congress" necessarily implies the two Houses of Congress acting independently in their 
corporate capacities, whereas the text of the Constitution is more ambivalent-allowing 
for the two Houses of Congress acting independently in their corporate capacities or for

1708 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 80 
the Constitution, such as Chancellor J runes Kent and Professor 
William Duer, writing in the wake of the Twelfth Amendment, 
thought that the counting function still belonged to the President of 
the Senate.234 
The Wisconsin Incident of 185?235 probably stands as a paradigm 
case in support of the proposition that the counting function belongs 
to the Senate and House of Representatives and not to the President 
of the Senate. During the Wisconsin Incident, Senator Pugh noted 
the obvious conflict-of-interest problem if the President of the Senate 
had sole responsibility for counting, calling it a "power higher than 
the veto."236 During the Electoral Count Act debates, Senator 
Bayard keenly observed that the President of the Senate "cannot 
even count" the electoral votes; that "[h]e cannot even inspect them, 
except in the incidental and casual manner that is implied by the fact 
that his hand shall open the sealed envelope which contains the list of 
the electoral vote."237 Representative Caldwell recalled the President 
of the Senate's unsuccessful attempts to assume the counting function 
in the Wisconsin Incident of 1857 and the Hayes-Tilden Incident of 
1877 ,238 and described the primary purpose of the Electoral Count 
Act as "decid[ing], first, that the power to count the vote is not in the 
President of the Senate."239 
234. Chancellor Kent stated: 
I presume, in the absence of all legislative provision on the subject, that the 
President of the Senate counts the votes, and determines the result, and that the 
two houses are present only as spectators, to witness the fairness and accuracy of 
the transaction, and to act only if no choice be made by the electors. 
2 KENT'S COMMENTARIES, supra note 19, at *276-77; see DOER'S COMMENTARIES, supra 
note 19, at 88-89 (similar). Note that Chancellor Kent seems to believe that Congress may 
by law take the counting function away from the President of the Senate; the source of 
Congress's power to do so is unclear. The question of Congress's source of power to enact 
legislation regulating the counting function is discussed in Part II.A.2 infra.

2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 1709 
The best interpretation as a matter of text and the better 
interpretation as a matter of history is that the counting function is 
vested in the Senate and House of Representatives. This does not 
answer, however, whether the counting function is delegable. The 
relevant text of the Constitution is best read to exclude counting by 
unnamed agents, notwithstanding general constitutional limits to the 
delegation of powers. The consensus view of the Members of 
Congress during the Electoral Count Act debates was that the 
counting function is not delegable.240 Moreover, the related textual 
considerations of the "when" and "where" of counting electoral votes 
strongly militate against the delegation of the counting function to 
unnamed agents-including coordinate branches of government such 
as the federal judiciary.241 
A final consideration is whether the President of the Senate has a 
vote in the counting function when questions arise. Although the 
counting of electoral votes takes place in the presence of the 
President of the Senate, the President of the Senate participates no 
more in the counting function than she participates in trial of 
impeachment-in neither case does the Vice President have a vote.242 
The Constitution carefully circumscribes the participation of the Vice 
President in the business of the Senate: "The Vice President of the 
United States shall be President of the Senate, but shall have no Vote, 
240. For the historical view, see, for example, COUNTING ELECTORAL VOTES, supra 
note 3, at 445 (remarks of Sen. Bayard) ("That you could not delegate that power to 
another body I cannot doubt."); id. at 531 (remarks of Sen. Boutwell) ("Congress must 
exercise the power and perform the duty, and it is not possible under the Constitution to 
transfer it to anybody else."); 18 CONG. REC. 51 (remarks of Rep. Adams) ("I can not 
conceive that any statute can take away from either of these two legislative bodies the 
power to come to a yes or no on any question relating to the business they then have in 
hand under the provisions of the Constitution."). 
The scholarly view also supports the non-delegation of the counting function. See, 
e.g., Ross & Josephson, supra note 7, at 715 ("We agree with Pinckney that the Grand 
Committee procedure proposed in 1800 was unconstitutional because we do not believe 
Congress could delegate its joint power to count to a committee of selected members."); 
Spear, supra note 18, at 157 ( observing that if the counting power is lodged in the two 
Houses of Congress, Congress cannot delegate the counting power to a committee "any 
more than it can establish a commission to levy taxes, or declare war"). 
241. See text accompanying infra notes 267-313. 
242. But cf. RAWLE, supra note 206, at 206. Rawle argued that: 
Id. It is not stated in the Constitution whether the president of the senate is on the 
trial of an impeachment restricted, as in legislative cases, to the casting vote. As 
he is constituted one of the judges by being appointed to preside without any 
restriction, the fair inference would be, that he is entitled to vote like the other 
judges, but on the trial last mentioned of a judge of the Supreme Court, the vote 
of the vice president does not appear in the printed journal.  VP-R0000181_0059

1710 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 80 
unless they be equally divided."243 The joint convention of the Senate 
and House of Representatives-assembled for the purpose of the 
electoral count-is most decidedly not the Senate. To be sure, the 
Electoral Count Act provides that, upon any objection to an electoral 
vote, the Senate shall separately withdraw to consider the objection.244 
Notwithstanding constitutional objections to this bicameralism,245 
neither textual nor structural reasons suggest that the President of the 
Senate's tie-breaking vote in the Article I business of the Senate 
applies to any Article II business of the Senate in counting electoral 
votes.246 
243. U.S. CONST. art. I,§ 3, cl. 4. 
244. See 3 U.S.C. § 15 (2000). 
245. See infra notes 287-313, 526-53 and accompanying text. 
246. As a related matter, it is not at all clear that the Vice President may cast a tie­
breaking vote in a contingency election for Vice President in the Senate should there be 
no winner under the electoral college mode of vice presidential election. U.S. CONST. 
amend. XII provides: 
The person having the greatest number of votes as Vice-President, shall be the 
Vice-President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of Electors 
appointed, and if no person have a majority, then from the two highest numbers 
on the list, the Senate shall choose the Vice-President; a quorum for the purpose 
shall consist of two-thirds of the whole number of Senators, and a majority of the 
whole number shall be necessary to a choice. 
Some scholars have suggested that the Vice President could cast such a tie­
breaking vote. See, e.g., Ho, supra note 195, at 239 n.47; Levinson & Young, supra note 
195, at 934 n.37. At least one scholar has raised the possibility that the Vice President 
could not cast such a tie-breaking vote. See Akhil Reed Amar, President Thurmond? 
(Nov. 2, 2000), at http://slate.msn.com/?id=l006401 ( on file with the North Carolina Law 
Review). 
There are some very good reasons to seriously doubt that the Vice President could 
cast such a tie-breaking vote. As a textual matter, the Vice President is not a "Senator" 
and the Twelfth Amendment ostensibly requires a majority of the whole number of 
Senators-today, fifty-one Senators. If there is no majority of Senators in a contingency 
election for Vice President in the Senate, the Senate would have to choose again. Note 
that the same is true in the House of Representatives where there is no arbiter to cast a 
tie-breaking vote. If there is no majority of states in a contingency election for President in 
the House of Representatives, the House would have to choose again. We have seen this 
done before: In the contingency election for President in 1801, the House of 
Representatives completed thirty-five rounds of balloting before choosing a President, see 
supra note 3. 
More generally: The Framers generally understood and appreciated the conflict 
of interest problems of the Vice Presidency, see supra notes 204-13 and accompanying 
text. It is worth hesitating before concluding that one person has the power to determine 
an election, particularly (but not only) when that one person would be likely to benefit 
from the decision. While it is true that other Senators may have conflict of interest 
problems because they too could be candidates for Vice President, it is one thing to say 
that a Senator may vote for himself or herself along with other Senators, and quite another 
to give the decisive vote to one man or woman. The Vice President's tie-breaking vote is 
decisive in a way that the votes of Senators are not. Interestingly, when the Framers 
contemplated direct presidential election by Congress, they rejected without discussion  VP-R0000181_0060 
(2021-079) 
2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 
c. What Is Counting and What Is To Be Counted? 1711 
Two significant and interrelated questions remain. First, what is 
counting? Second, what is to be counted? Again, the relevant 
constitutional text provides that "[t]he President of the Senate shall, 
in the Presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all 
the Certificates, and the Votes shall then be counted. "247 As has been 
documented extensively, the word "shall" is a word of obligation.248 
giving the Vice President a tie-breaking vote. See 2 FARRAND, supra note 35, at 403 
("Mr[.] Read moved 'that in case the numbers for the two highest in votes should be 
equal, then the President of the Senate shall have an additional casting vote,' which was 
disagreed to by a general negative."). 
Finally, if the theory is that the Vice President's power to cast tie-breaking votes 
only applies to Article I business (legislation and the internal matters of the Senate, 
including the election of Senate officers and the appointment of Senate committees) and 
not to Article II or Twelfth Amendment business, then it would also follow that the Vice 
President would not have a tie-breaking vote under the Treaty Clause or the 
Appointments Clause, which both appear in Article II. See U.S. CONST. art. II, § 2, cl. 2. 
This appears to be the case, reinforcing the arguments above. It is not possible for the 
Vice President to cast a tie-breaking vote with respect to treaties which require a two­
thirds majority of Senators, see id., but it is possible for the Vice President to do so with 
respect to presidential nominations under the Appointments Clause, which only require a 
majority of Senators. Notwithstanding, Alexander Hamilton intimated early on that the 
Vice President could not cast a tie-breaking vote on presidential nominations under the 
Appointments Clause. See THE FEDERALIST No. 69, at 389 (Alexander Hamilton) 
(Clinton Rossiter ed., Mentor 1999) (1961) ("In the national government, if the Senate 
should be divided, no appointment could be made; in the government of New York, if the 
council should be divided, the governor can tum the scale and confirm his own 
nomination."). The lack of mention of the Vice President is surprising given that he 
discussed the Vice President (and her tie-breaking vote) in the immediately preceding 
essay, see THE FEDERALIST No. 68, at 47 (Alexander Hamilton) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 
Mentor 1999) (1961), but perhaps he thought that the Vice President would not 
necessarily act in accordance with the President's interests (recall that prior to the 
development of the party system, the Vice President was merely the runner-up in the 
presidential election and oftentimes the chief opponent of the President). Only once in 
our nation's history, to my knowledge, has a Vice President cast a tie-breaking vote on a 
presidential appointment. In 1832, President Andrew Jackson nominated Senator Martin 
Van Buren as ambassador to Great Britain. The Senate split evenly, and Vice President 
Calhoun broke the tie by voting against President Jackson's nomination. See Vice 
Presidents of the United States, Martin Van Buren (1833-1837), at 
http://www.senate.govnearning/stat_vp8.html (last visited Apr. 17, 2002) (on file with the 
North Carolina Law Review). Vice President Calhoun's negative vote was unnecessary of 
course, as a tie vote is widely considered to be defeated, though some accounts treat his 
vote as the "deciding vote." See, e.g., id. 
247. U.S. CONST. amend. XII (emphasis added).

1712 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 80 
The Electoral College Clauses do not say "and the Votes may then be 
counted." 
Ardent textualists will readily notice two points. First, what is 
the significance of the difference between "Certificates" and 
"Votes"? The Constitution says that only the "Votes" are to be 
counted. Second, what is the significance of the word "all" and its 
selective use and seeming disuse? The Constitution says that "all" of 
the certificates are to be opened but does not say that "all" of the 
votes shall then be counted. Are these subtle textual distinctions a 
grant of power to the counting agent not to count all votes? 
The ultimate question is whether counting is, on balance, a 
ministerial or judicial act. If counting is a ministerial act, it is one of 
ascertainment and aggregation-Congress is simply a "central 
collecting agency" and a "tabulating point."249 This view has some 
support in the purpose of the Electoral College Clauses. There would 
be no need for Congress to aggregate electoral votes if the electors 
met at some central location, but it was precisely to avoid the 
potential for cabal and corruption that the Electoral Colleges Clauses 
provide that the electors should meet in their respective states.250 We 
shall call this the "thin" conception of the counting function.251 
word "shall" is used some eighteen times and the word "may" is used once. See U.S. 
CONST. art. II, § 1, cl. 4 ("The Congress may determine the Time of chusing the Electors, 
and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout 
the United States.") ( emphasis added).

CONSTITUTION 122 (Jonathan Elliot ed., 2d ed. 1836) [hereinafter ELLIOT'S DEBATES] 
(remarks of William Davie at North Carolina ratifying convention) ("He is elected on the 
same day in every state, so that there can be no possible combination between the 
electors."). At the North Carolina ratifying convention, James Iredell remarked: 
Had the time of election been different in different states, the electors chosen in 
one state might have gone from state to state, and conferred with the other 
electors, and the election might have been thus carried on under undue 
influence. But by this provision, the electors must meet in the different states on 
the same day, and cannot confer together. They may not even know who are the 
electors in the other states. There can be, therefore, no kind of combination. It 
is probable that the man who is the object of choice of thirteen different states, 
the electors in each voting unconnectedly with the rest, must be a person who 
possesses, in high degree, the confidence and respect of his country.

(2021-079) 
2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 1713 
If counting is a judicial act, then Congress sits as a court of 
sorts-a "court of last resort"252--checking the actions of electors in 
the electoral colleges. We shall call this the "thick" conception of the 
counting function. As Professor Spear nicely summarized, counting, 
"in so far as it is a mere enumeration and aggregation of units, is a 
purely ministerial act; but, in so far as it involves any judgment as to 
what votes shall be counted, it is a judicial, or, at least, quasi judicial 
act."253 Clearly, there is no clean break between the "thin" and 
"thick" conceptions of the counting function. Even the "thin" 
conception requires some ascertainment of what is to be counted.254 
The debates over the drafting of the Electoral College Clauses at 
the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 suggest that the Framers had the 
ascertainment issue in mind. The Framers rejected a proposal by 
James Madison and Hugh Williamson to insert the phrase "who shall 
have balloted" after the word "Electors." The purpose of this 
proposal was "so that the non voting electors not being counted might 
not increase the number necessary as a majority of the whole-to 
decide the choice without the agency of the Senate."255 John 
Dickinson successfully moved to insert after "Electors" the word 
"appointed." Thus, under the Electoral College Clauses, the requisite 
number of electoral votes needed for victory is "a Majority of the 
whole Number of Electors appointed."256 This drafting history 
suggests that the Framers considered the possibility that there might 
not be a "vote"-but only if an elector shall not have balloted. They 
did not consider the possibility that an electoral vote might be 
unconstitutional. While silence is difficult to interpret, the Framers' 
of Government, that intrigue, combination, and corruption, would be effectually 
shut out, and a free and pure election of the President of the United States made 
perpetual.

1714 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 80 
probable conception of the counting function was more "thin" than 
"thick." 
Members of Congress have debated the nature of the counting 
function intensely over the past 210 years. The issue was first debated 
during the Missouri Incident. Representative Clay stated his belief 
that counting necessarily involved judging: 
In a case of votes coming forward which could not be 
counted, the Constitution was silent; but, fortunately, the 
end in that case carried with it the means. The two Houses 
were called on to enumerate the votes for President and 
Vice-President; of course they were called on to decide what 
are votes.257 
This was a fairly "thick" conception of the counting function. 
Representative Randolph disagreed. " 'Your office,' said he, 'in 
regard to the electoral vote is merely ministerial. It is to count the 
votes, and you undertake to reject votes.' "258 Representative Archer, 
responding to Representative Randolph's argument, thought that 
counting could not exist without judging: 
He was a little surprised ... that the House had no power to 
pass any judgment on any return. He always thought that, 
wherever- was lodged the power to receive a return, there 
was also a power to pass judgment on the validity of that 
return. Suppose any Territory not within the limits of the 
United States at the time, Florida, for example, to send votes 
here for electors; was there no authority by which these 
votes could be rejected? Suppose a State entitled to twenty­
seven votes should send thirty-seven votes, would any 
gentlemen contend that there was no power in this House to 
judge of the proper number?259 
This is not necessarily a "thick" conception of counting at all; as 
we shall see, many of Representative Archer's concerns come before 
Congress meets for the purpose of the electoral count. For instance, 
257. COUNTING ELECTORAL VOTES, supra note 3, at 52 (1821). Just two years later, 
Senator Benton observed: 
Two questions of great delicacy now present themselves: 
1. If electors are not appointed according to the Constitution, can their votes be 
counted? 
2. If objected to, who shall judge them? 
It is the duty of the two houses of Congress to count the votes. Can they count 
unconstitutional votes? If they cannot, shall they not judge every vote before it 
is counted?

prior to the electoral count, each House of Congress would have 
resolved whether or not to recognize Florida as a member of the 
Union in considering whether to seat any of Florida's Senators or 
Representatives. 
During the Wisconsin Incident, Representative Marshall also 
advocated a "thick" conception of the counting function. He bluntly 
asked, "What is to count? What faculty does it involve? I say not 
only the faculty of enumerating, but the faculty of judging whether it 
is a vote or not."260 In a speech directed to the President of the 
Senate during the electoral count, Representative Marshall sought to 
justify his conception of the counting function upon the textual 
distinction between the word "Certificates" and the word "Votes": 
Whether that is a vote or not must depend upon the 
determination of this convention, and if you will regard the 
verbiage of the Constitution, you will find that your function 
goes no further than to open the certificates. The language 
of the Constitution is that "the President of the Senate, in 
the presence of the House of Representatives, shall open all 
the certificates," and then the phraseology changes, and 
proceeds, "and the votes shall be counted," not by you, but 
by us; and whenever a vote is challenged, this is the time, 
and this the only place, where a determination can be 
formed whether it is a vote.261 
This argument does not withstand a close examination of the 
Electoral College Clauses. The Constitution employs the word 
"Certificates" instead of "Votes" for a simple reason. Each of the 
Electoral Colleges sends a "List" (now two lists with the adoption of 
the Twelfth Amendment)-which contains the "Votes" of the 
electors-to the President of the Senate. The Constitution requires 
that each "List" be signed and certified by the electors in each State; 
when the "List" is so signed and certified, it becomes a "Certificate." 
Thus, the contradistinction between "Certificates" and "Votes" is of 
little interpretive value. 
Other Members of Congress agreed with Representative 
Marshall. For example, Representative Orr asked, "Does not the 
requisition to be present at the counting necessarily carry the right to 
260. Id. at 142. 
261. Id. at 89. Representative Marshall misquoted the constitutional text. He also did 
not notice the textual significance in the use and seeming disuse of the word "all." In a 
later remark, he came close: "The President of the Senate has to open all the certificates, 
and then his function is performed; and after all the certificates have been opened, the 
counting of the votes is then to commence and be concluded." Id. at 95 (emphasis in 
original).  VP-R0000181_0065

1716 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 80 
determine what votes offered are legal, and what votes may be void, 
as an inseparable incident to the power of counting?"262 He 
concluded that the "Constitution makes us the managers or 
canvassers to count the electoral votes, and in doing so gives us the 
power to say whether a vote presented is or is not legal."263 Those 
who advocated a "thin" conception of the counting function were in 
the minority. Senator Toucey put the point best in his statement that 
"[t]he whole proceeding of counting is based on the idea merely of 
disclosing to the public in a safe, authentic way, the actual state of the 
vote; and when that is ascertained truly, the President who is chosen 
by that vote is President, let Congress do what it may."264 
Finally, the nature of the counting function occupied a prominent 
position in the debates over the Electoral Count Act. The positions 
taken are well summarized by the statements of Senator Edmunds, 
who supported the Electoral Count Act, and Senator Bayard, who 
opposed it. Senator Edmunds was of the view that a vote 
must mean a legal vote, a vote which is in accordance with 
the provisions of the Constitution of the United States and 
in accordance with the laws which have existed for so many 
years respecting the method by which and the time within 
which the vote of each State is to be expressed and 
returned.265 
Senator Bayard pointed out the implications of Senator Edmunds's 
view. He asked: 
Were the two houses of Congress ever intended to become 
the judges of the electoral vote of the people of this country? 
Apparently by the Constitution their duties would seem to 
be of a ministerial character only. They were to stand by 
and witness the counting, and their presence in that way as 
witnesses was supposed to be a security. Now you change 
this from a merely ministerial power into a judicial power of 
the very gravest and most important character. Is there a 
warrant for that in the Constitution of the United States?266

2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 1717 
In sum, there is considerable historical support for both the 
"thin" and "thick" conceptions of the counting function. An answer 
to the scope of Congress's counting power is informed by the "when" 
and "where" of counting, issues which we shall take up next. 
d. When Is the Counting Done? 
The Electoral College Clauses contain an immediacy principle 
and for good reason. The relevant text of the Constitution provides 
that once the President of the Senate has opened all of the 
Certificates, "the votes shall then be counted."267 This is the 
immediacy principle of the Electoral College Clauses. Another part 
of this clause reinforces this immediacy principle. In case of electoral 
deadlock, the House of Representatives is to "immediately" choose 
the next President from those on the list.268 
The word "immediately" has special significance in the Electoral 
College Clauses.269 According to Senator Pinckney, the word 
"immediately" in this Clause means "instantly, and on the spot, 
without leaving the House in which they are then assembled, and 
without adjournment."270 He explained that the word was inserted to 
guard against the possibility of domestic intrigue and foreign 
influence at the Seat of Government of the United States: 
[T]he election by the House of Representatives taking place 
immediately after the votes have been opened and counted, 
that body would go to the election free and uninfluenced [by 
leaders of domestic intrigue and foreign emissaries], as they 
ought. And is not this, sir, safer; is it not better than that the 
smallest delay should take place in determining it? . . . [I]t 
will be less dangerous to the public interest, that even one 
who may not be the most qualified of the five, should be 
elected, than that Congress should adjourn to deliberate on 
it, and thus expose themselves, and the best interests of their 
constituents, to the secret and artful attacks that will be 
made on their integrity.271

269. The word "immediately" is rare in the original Constitution, and is used in only 
one other clause of the original Constitution. See U.S. CONST. art. I, § 3, cl. 2 
("Immediately after they shall be assembled in Consequence of the first Election, they 
shall be divided as equally as may be into three Classes."). 
270. See 10 ANNALS OF CONG. 137 (1800). 
271. See id. at 138 (emphasis added). The Twelfth Amendment, adopted in 1804, also 
contains a requirement that the House of Representatives shall "immediately" choose a 
President. However, the Twelfth Amendment seems to significantly soften-and perhaps 
quash-Senator Pinckney's immediacy principle. The Twelfth Amendment, unlike the  VP-R0000181_0067

1718 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 80 
At the Philadelphia Convention of 1787, James Wilson echoed 
Senator Pinckney's observation and his underlying rationale. He 
noted that "if the election be made as it ought as soon as the votes of 
the electors are opened & it is known that no one has a majority of 
the whole, there can be little danger of corruption."272 In a letter to 
the Washington Federalist, "Horatius" advised that 
[t]he choice is required to be immediately made, in order 
that the result may be declared in the presence of the 
Senate, and to prevent the possibility of intrigue and 
corruption. The choice must be therefore made before the 
house adjourns or disperses, and after the convention of the 
Senate and House of Representatives terminates, the house 
cannot at a future day act upon this subject.273 
original Electoral College Clauses, provides that "if the House of Representatives shall 
not choose a President whenever the right of choice shall devolve upon them, before the 
fourth day of March next following, then the Vice-President shall act as President, as in 
the case of the death or other constitutional disability of the President." U.S. CONST. 
amend. XII, amended by U.S. CONST. amend. XX, § 3. Federal law, at the time of the 
adoption of the Twelfth Amendment, specified that the counting of electoral votes would 
take place on the second Wednesday in February. Thus, the Twelfth Amendment seems 
to countenance up to two weeks of deliberation by the House of Representatives. William 
Alexander Duer made the point that 
[a]lthough the Constitution directs that when no person is found to have a 
majority of the Electoral votes, the choice shall be immediately made by the 
House of Representatives, yet it is not held obligatory upon that House to 
proceed to the election directly upon the separation of the two Houses; but that 
it may proceed either at that time and place, or omit it until afterwards. This 
construction was adopted before the [Twelfth Amendment], and there can now 
be no doubt of its correctness, as the amendment expressly declares the choice of 
the House to be valid, if made before the fourth of March following the day on 
which the Electoral votes are counted. 
DUER'S COMMENTARIES, supra note 19, at 89-90. 
If we read the immediacy principle as loosely as Professor Duer suggests, the 
current Constitution seems to countenance exactly seventeen days of deliberation by the 
House of Representatives. See U.S. CONST. amend. XX, § 1 ("The terms of the President 
and Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of January, and the terms of Senators 
and Representatives at noon on the 3d day of January, ... and the terms of their 
successors shall then begin."). 
It should be noted that the Twelfth Amendment does not specify when the Senate 
shall choose the Vice President should the choice devolve upon it. Could it be that the 
framers of the Twelfth Amendment simply forgot to add comparable language for the 
Senate? See also 1 KENT'S COMMENTARIES, supra note 19, at *278 ("The [C]onstitution 
does not specifically prescribe when or where the [S]enate is to choose [V]ice-[P]resident, 
if no choice be made by the electors; and, I presume, the [S]enate may elect by themselves, 
at any time before the fourth day of March following."). It goes without saying that the 
current Constitution seems to countenance exactly seventeen days of deliberation by the 
Senate. See U.S. CONST. amend. XX, § 1.

2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 1719 
The immediacy principle implies that the counting agent may not 
delay in counting the electoral votes. The "then" requirement 
militates against the deliberative aspects of counting and the judging 
of the electoral votes. After all, judicial determinations take time. 
The Electoral Count Act does not violate the immediacy 
principle. 3 U.S.C. § 17 puts strict time limits on the electoral count: 
when the two Houses separate to debate an objection to an electoral 
vote, each Member of each House may only speak once on the 
objection for a maximum of five minutes, and total debate in each 
House is limited to two hours.274 Although this provision does not 
violate the immediacy principle, it is patently unconstitutional­
Congress may not bind by statute either House in the rules of its 
proceedings.275 As we shall see next, the "then" requirement also has 
Horatius's letter. Professor Ackerman believes that "Horatius" is John Marshall, a 
conclusion which he (tentatively) reaches based on a computer analysis of Marshall's 
writings (performed with his linguist friend, Roger Shuy), and based on other "old­
fashioned circumstantial evidence," including a snippet from Marshall historian Albert J. 
Beveridge. See Email from Bruce Ackerman to Vasan Kesavan (Apr. 17, 2002) (on file 
with author). 
274. 3 U.S.C. § 17 (2000) provides that 
When the two Houses separate to decide upon an objection that may have been 
made to the counting of any electoral vote or votes from any State, or other 
question arising in the matter, each Senator and Representative may speak to 
such objection or question five minutes, and not more than once; but after such 
debate shall have lasted two hours it shall be the duty of the presiding officer of 
each House to put the main question without further debate. 
275. See U.S. CONST. art. I, § 5, cl. 2 (Rules of Proceedings Clause) ("Each House may 
determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behaviour, and, 
with the Concurrence of two[-]thirds, expel a Member."). Anyone who wishes to argue 
that the Electoral Count Act is constitutional faces the most difficult task in justifying the 
constitutionality of3 U.S.C. § 17. 
During the Electoral Count Act debates, Senator Christiancy noted the 
constitutional problem. "I notice," said Christiancy, 
that this bill, which it is proposed to make an act of Congress, provides for the 
length of the time that any Senator or Representative may speak when the 
Senate is acting separately and the House is acting separately. I wish to know if 
that is not trenching upon the constitutional power of each house to make its 
own rules to regulate its own proceedings. 
COUNTING ELECTORAL VOTES, supra note 3, at 688 (1876). Senator Thurman responded 
to the point with an entirely unconvincing answer: 
Toe joint rule heretofore adopted prohibited all .debate, and it seems to have 
been held good. No question was ever made in respect of that rule. If we have 
the right to legislate upon this subject, as I think we have-and this whole bill 
goes upon that foundation-then I think we have a right to regulate the mode of 
procedure so that it shall not be defeated, as it otherwise might be, by the 
consumption of time in speaking."

bills." Id.  VP-R0000181_0069

an implication for where the counting (and any potential judging) of 
electoral votes takes place. 
e. Where Is the Counting Done? 
The Electoral College Clauses provide that the lists of electoral 
votes from the several states are to be "directed to the President of 
the Senate"276 and that "[t]he President of the Senate shall, in the 
Presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the 
Certificates, and the Votes shall then be counted."277 These clauses 
are the font of two mutually reinforcing "where" principles: the 
publicity principle and the unicameralism principle. 
The publicity principle is easy to identify. The President of the 
Senate is not supposed to open all of the certificates behind closed 
doors, but is only to do so "in the presence of the Senate and House of 
Representatives."278 Although this phrase does not necessarily 
modify the subsequent vote counting phrase as a grammatical matter, 
the Constitution almost certainly requires that the counting of the 
votes take place in an equally public manner.279 Moreover, there is an 
276. U.S. CONST. art. II,§ 1, cl. 3. This language is likely a vestige of early drafts of the 
Electoral College Clauses which vested the choice of a President and Vice President in 
case of electoral deadlock in the Senate. See, e.g., 2 FARRAND, supra note 35, at 497-98. 
There is a reasonable functional explanation as to why the Framers kept this requirement. 
The Framers believed that the Senate would be in almost constant session anyway, unlike 
the House of Representatives. See, e.g., id. at 274 (remarks of George Mason) (observing 
that Senators "will probably settle themselves at the seat of Govt." unlike Representatives 
"chosen frequently and obliged to return frequently among the people"); id. at 523 
(remarks of James Wilson) ("The Senate, will moreover in all probability be in constant 
Session."); id. at 537 (remarks of George Mason) (supporting privy council of six members 
to the President on basis that it would "prevent the constant sitting of the Senate which he 
thought dangerous"); id. at 639 (remarks of George Mason) (referring to "long continued 
sessions of the Senate"); GEORGE MASON, OBJECTIONS TO THE CONSTITUTION OF 
GOVERNMENT FORMED BY THE CONVENTION (1787), reprinted in 2 THE C0!\1PLETE 
ANTI-FEDERALIST 11 (Herbert J. Storing ed., 1981) (referring to Senate as "a constant 
existing Body almost continually sitting"); Essay XVI of Brutus (Apr. 10, 1788), reprinted 
in id. at 444 (stating that Senators "will for the most part of the time be absent from the 
state they represent" and that Senators will be inhabitants of the "federal city"). 
277. U.S. CONST. art. II,§ 1, cl. 3. 
278. U.S. CONST. amend. XII (emphasis added). Interestingly, an early draft of the 
Electoral College Clauses at the Philadelphia Convention provided that "[t]he President 
of the Senate shall in that House open all the certificates; and the votes shall be then & 
there counted." 2 FARRAND, supra note 35, at 497-98 ( emphasis added). 
279. Indeed, the secret drafting history of the Constitution shows that when the "in 
presence" phrase was agreed to, it was inserted after the word "counted" in the draft of 
the Electoral College Clauses, thus modifying both the opening of certificates and the 
counting of votes. See 2 FARRAND, supra note 35, at 518, 526. When the report was 
produced, however, the text was re-ordered and read: "The President of the Senate shall 
in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives open all the certificates & the 
votes shall then be counted." Id. at 528; see also COUNTING ELECTORAL VOTES, supra  VP-R0000181_0070 
(2021-079) 
2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 1721 
excellent functional reason why the Senate and the House of 
Representatives are required to be present for the electoral count: if 
there should be no winner under the electoral college mode of 
presidential and vice presidential election, the duty of choosing the 
President devolves upon the House of Representatives, and the duty 
of choosing the Vice President devolves upon the Senate.280 
Under the publicity principle, the secret proceeding 
contemplated by the Grand Committee Bill would have been grossly 
unconstitutional.281 During the Wisconsin Incident of 1857, Senator 
Thompson thought the idea of the publicity principle "was that we 
were not to go into executive session, nor, by some secret cabal or 
clandestine arrangement, get together here and have a coup d'etat, 
and make a President."282 Thus, the elections of 1801 and 1825, in 
which the House of Representatives chose the President in closed­
door proceedings, were also grossly unconstitutional.283

your jealous citizens will remember that secrecy always accompanies corruption, 
and that even if this committee were to act in the most honorable manner, yet 
still that the friends of the candidate whose votes have been refused, if such 
refusal cost him his election, will never cease to suspect that all has not been fair, 
and that some improper reason had influenced the decision.

1722 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 80 
The publicity principle probably extends to the choosing of a 
President and a Vice President in case of electoral deadlock as well. 
Although the Constitution does not explicitly specify, it probably 
requires that the House of Representatives "immediately" choose the 
President in the presence of the Senate,284 and that the Senate 
"immediately" choose the Vice President in the presence of the 
House.285 This mode of presidential and vice presidential selection 
maximizes legitimacy. 
The question is what the publicity principle implies for the 
judging of electoral votes. A narrow view of the publicity principle is 
that the Members of Congress come together to ensure the proper 
aggregation of the electoral votes. During the Wisconsin Incident of 
1857, Representative Orr urged a broader view, arguing that the 
publicity principle is the font of congressional power to reject 
"illegal" electoral votes: 
Suppose the result of the election would depend on the vote 
of [Wisconsin]: how would it be possible to declare who was 
elected until it had been decided whether or not that vote 
was to be received? Who is to decide that? The 
Constitution and the laws require that the two houses shall 
(Opinion Clause); U.S. CONST. art. II, § 2, cl. 3 (Commissions Clause); U.S. CONST. art. 
III, § 3, cl. 1 (Treason Clause); see also Harrison, supra note 23, at 705 (noting that "a 
public occasion for the [electoral] count will inspire public confidence in the probity of the 
process"); cf PA. CONST. OF 1776, § 13 ("The doors of the house in which the 
representatives of the freemen of this state shall sit in the general assembly, shall be and 
remain open for the admission of all persons who behave decently, except only when the 
welfare of this state may require the doors to be shut."). 
284. See, e.g., 10 ANNALS OF CONG. 137 (remarks of Sen. Pinckney) (describing 
immediacy principle as "instantly, and on the spot, without leaving the House in which they 
are then assembled, and without adjournment") (emphasis added); 2 FARRAND, supra 
note 35, at 518-19 (describing motion of James Madison that, in case of electoral 
deadlock, two-thirds of Senators be present in presence of the Senate and the House of 
Representatives to choose the President; motion passed by a vote of six to four and was 
subsequently rendered moot by motion to vest choice of President in case of electoral 
deadlock in House of Representatives); Horatius Letter, supra note 273 ("The choice is 
required to be immediately made, in order that the result may be declared in the presence of 
the Senate, and to prevent the possibility of intrigue and corruption."). 
Although the Twelfth Amendment relaxed the immediacy principle (giving the 
House of Representatives additional time to choose a President in case of electoral 
deadlock, see supra note 271), it is much less clear that it also relaxed the publicity 
principle. It appears that the House of Representatives chose the President in the 
presence of the Senate in 1801 and 1825. See 1 KENT'S COMMENTARIES, supra note 19, at 
,:,277 (noting that the Senate was "admitted to be present as spectators"); DUER'S 
COMMENTARIES, supra note 19, at 90 (similar). 
285. This principle was violated in the electoral count of 1837. The Senate chose the 
Vice President because of electoral deadlock but did so in the Senate Chamber and not in 
the presence of the House of Representatives in joint convention.  VP-R0000181_0072

meet in joint convention, and that the votes of the electors 
of the several States shall be opened and counted before 
them. 
This, in my judgment, confers upon them the power to 
determine whether a vote be valid or invalid. Otherwise it is 
a mere farce if they are called on only to witness the 
counting. The counting might just as well be done by the 
Vice-President or the President of the Senate, without the 
presence of the two houses. But it is to guard against an 
illegal vote being counted that the two houses are required 
to be assembled together.286 1723 
This brings us to the second "where" principle: unicameralism. 
The Constitution requires that the two Houses of Congress come 
together for the purpose of opening all the electoral certificates and 
counting the electoral votes. This practice has been followed for all of 
our electoral count history. In the first and second presidential 
elections, the Senate and the House of Representatives assembled in 
the Senate Chamber for the opening and counting of the electoral 
votes, and in all subsequent elections, the Senate and the House have 
assembled in the House Chamber.287 
The unicameralism principle suggests that any power to judge 
electoral votes is vested in the one body which is present when the 
electoral certificates are opened and when the electoral votes are 
counted288 and is to be resolved on a per capita vote basis.289 The 
286. COUNTING ELECTORAL VOTES, supra note 3, at 90 (emphasis added); see also id. 
at 114 (remarks of Sen. Butler) ("The Senate of the United States is called into the other 
house as a corporate body, an imposing corporate body, to be a witness to the election of 
the Chief Magistrate of this country, and to see that the votes are counted fairly."); id. at 
452 (remarks of Sen. Frelinghuysen) (supporting amendment to Twenty-second Joint 
Rule) ("Why, sir, are the House and the Senate present? It is because they represent the 
sovereignty of the Government at that most critical moment when the executive power is 
to be transmitted, and they are there that the transmission may be under their watchful 
guardianship."). 
287. Under the current Electoral Count Act, the President of the Senate and Members 
of Congress are to meet in the Hall of the House of Representatives. See 3 U.S.C. § 15 
(2000). During the Wisconsin Incident of 1857, Senator Thompson declared his belief that 
the intent of the Framers was to make the House of Representatives present as witnesses 
in the Senate Chamber. See COUNTING ELECTORAL VOTES, supra note 3, at 126. 
288. In congressional debate, this one body has been repeatedly referred to as a 
"convention" or a "joint convention" of the two Houses, although the Constitution does 
not employ this word. There were, of course, those who disagreed with this term. See, 
e.g., COUNTING ELECTORAL VOTES, supra note 3, at 111 (remarks of Sen. Stuart). 
289. The unicameralism principle, without more, does not require that the counting 
function be exercised by the Senators and Representatives in the unicameral body on a 
per capita vote basis. The Senate and House of Representatives could, presumably 
without undue trouble, organize themselves and vote as separate bodies while convened  VP-R0000181_0073 
(2021-079) 
1724 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 80 
Electoral Count Act violates the unicameralism principle because it 
provides that, upon objection to an electoral vote in the joint 
assembly, the two Houses of Congress shall separate and 
independently decide on the legality of that electoral vote,290 thereby 
giving equal weight to the decision of the Senate and House of 
Representatives. One implication of the unicameralism ("where") 
principle and the immediacy ("when") principle is that the resolution 
of any electoral count questions cannot be vested in any judicial 
tribunal. Senator Morton put this point nicely in debates over the 
Electoral Count Act: 
Then and there. You cannot refer to any other tribunal; you 
cannot get the case before the Supreme Court of the United 
States or before any special court to be created for that 
purpose. These votes are then to be opened, and then and 
there they are to be counted.291 
The secret drafting history of the Constitution suggests the 
unicameralism principle. When the Committee of Eleven proposed 
the electoral college mode of presidential election, the draft provided 
that, "The President of the Senate shall in that House open all the 
certificates; and the votes shall be then & there counted" by the 
Senate.292 This clause was later amended to include the phrase "in the 
presence of the Senate and House of Representatives" and the "& 
there" language was dropped.293 However, there is very little reason 
to suppose that the counting was not to occur in that single body of 
Senators and Representatives.294 
together in one room. For present purposes, I define the unicameralism principle as 
counting electoral votes on a per capita vote basis (equivalent to the Senate and House of 
Representatives voting by joint ballot), thereby giving Representatives a decisive 
advantage over Senators in resolving disputes in the counting of electoral votes. As we 
shall see presently, this conception of the counting function makes better sense of 
constitutional structure.

294. As a background principle, it might be said that the Framers shied away from 
separate action by the two Houses in electing the President when both Houses were 
involved. Before the Framers agreed to the electoral college mode of election, the 
President was to be elected by the Legislature-not the two Houses of Congress acting 
separately-but by joint ballot. 2 FARRAND, supra note 35, at 401--03. The rationale was  VP-R0000181_0074

2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 1725 
There is ample historical support for the unicameralism principle. 
In the Sixth Congress, Representative and Framer Albert Gallatin 
moved to amend the Grand Committee Bill to provide that any 
decision on the legality of an electoral vote would be made by a 
majority of the Members of Congress then present at the electoral 
count.295 After a long debate, this motion fell just two votes shy of 
passing.296 Senator Baldwin, in his remarks on January 23, 1800, 
recognized that the Senators and Representatives would "me[ e ]t 
together in one room" to receive the electoral votes and "to judge 
only of its authentication."297 Senator Pinckney, in his remarks on 
March 28, 1800, also recognized the unicameralism principle, but 
nevertheless argued that Congress had no power to reject electoral 
votes.298 Other senators also supported the unicameralism principle. 
The preamble of their proposed alternative to the Grand Committee 
Bill provided that the Senators and Representatives assembled for the 
purpose of the electoral count form a single tribunal, with the number 
of Senators and Representatives from each state equal to the number 
of electors from each state.299 
to avoid the "[g]reat delay and confusion [which] would ensue if the two Houses shd [sic] 
vote separately, each having a negative on the choice of the other." Id. at 402 (remarks of 
Nathaniel Gorham). 
The Framers thought that a joint ballot was particularly important in one other 
area. Both the draft of the Constitution referred to the Committee of Style and its report 
provided for the appointment of the Treasurer of the United States by joint ballot of the 
Congress. See id. at 570 (draft referred to Committee of Style) (stating that Congress shall 
have power "[t]o appoint a Treasurer by joint ballot"); id. at 594 (report of Committee of 
Style) (first provision of precursor to U.S. CONST. art. I,§ 8) ("The Congress may by joint 
ballot appoint a treasurer."). This provision was subsequently deleted on September 14, 
1787, just three days before the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 completed its business. 
See id. at 614. 
295. Specifically,

1726 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 80 
In later years, those who have supported congressional control 
over electoral votes have voiced the unicameralism objection to the 
Electoral Count Act. For example, during the Missouri Incident, 
Representative Archer, emphasizing the "then" immediacy 
requirement of the electoral count, stated: 
He was opposed to this House undertaking to proceed in 
any manner as to the legality of the electoral votes. He 
could recognize no power in the House of Representatives 
on this subject separate from the Senate. . . . Does it not 
follow that the votes must be counted in the presence of the 
two Houses? For what purposes do they assemble together 
unless it be to determine on the legality of the votes. If not 
for this purpose, the joint meeting is for form and show and 
nothing else. We must, in my apprehension, determine the 
question in joint meeting, and in no other way.300 
However, Senator Rufus King disagreed, stating that he was 
"opposed to the settlement of any litigated question in joint meeting, 
where the Senate, as a body, would be lost; and argued that whenever 
any such should arise, it would be always proper that the two Houses 
should separate."301 
During the Wisconsin Incident, Senator Pugh made a strong 
argument in favor of the unicameralism principle. He believed that 
the joint convention was the proper forum to settle the Wisconsin 
problem because: 
The whole number of Senators and Representatives taken 
together is equal to the whole number of electors in all the 
colleges. It is exactly the same body of men in number, 
equal to all of them. All the States, if they had voted there 
yesterday through their Senators and Representatives, 
would have exercised the precise power which they 
exercised in the election of President.302

principle: 
I wish to submit a single remark to the President and to the Senate, for I do not 
consider that this convention can be addressed. We can take no vote. How are 
we to vote? Per capita or by States? Are we to vote as representatives of the 
people or representatives of States? If we cannot vote here, we cannot discuss. 
The only thing which remains for us to do, if there are insuperable difficulties in 
the way, is to adjourn immediately to our respective halls. Then let the Senate or 
the House of Representatives bring up the matter for action. By the present 
proceeding we are overturning the Government-we are making this a national  VP-R0000181_0076

2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 1727 
Even if the joint convention was a single tribunal-a court of last 
resort, according to Senator Pugh-the question remained as to how 
the voting should take place within the joint convention. Senator 
Pugh stated his belief that the voting should be per capita.303 
Representative Orr, speaking before the House of Representatives, 
concurred: "Who was to decide on the validity of the challenged 
vote? The two [H]ouses in joint convention by a per capita vote."304 
However, the textual argument against this position is that the 
Electoral College Clauses provide that the counting take place "in the 
Presence of the Senate and House of Representatives"-not "in the 
Presence of Senators and Representatives," suggesting that the 
counting function is to be exercised by the Senate and the House of 
Representatives acting separately in their corporate capacities, not by 
Senators and Representatives acting together in a single corporate 
capacity. 
Representative Orr, however, offered one additional structural 
argument in support of the per capita vote in the joint convention, an 
argument that answers Senator King's objection during the Missouri 
Incident that the power of the Senate would be "lost" in the joint 
convention. He pointed out that the "[s]enatorial electors" in the 
electoral colleges "possess[ ed] no power or dignity superior to those 
representing the congressional districts."305 Given this observation, 
the per capita vote made perfect sense: the Senate would have the 
same power in the joint convention that the senatorial electors had in 
the electoral colleges. 
During the Electoral Count Act debates, Senator Thurman 
succinctly expressed the unicameralism principle: "The Constitution 
is 'and the votes shall then be counted;' that is, shall be counted right 
there, in the presence of the two [H]ouses. That is what the 
Constitution requires . . . . They are not to be counted elsewhere.

They are to be counted then and there."306 Several years later, 
Senator George made a particularly compelling structural argument 
for unicameral action in judging electoral votes. His argument was 
that the counting function "is not a legislative function which ought to 
be considered separately by the two Houses, but it is rather in the 
nature of a judicial function,"307 and therefore the two Houses of 
Congress "should adopt that form in the performance of that 
uudicial] duty which would enable us to discharge it."308 Invoking the 
image of a court, he stated: 
Why, certainly, sir, it would be an anomaly in jurisprudence, 
it would be an anomaly surely in Anglo-Saxon 
jurisprudence, that for the ascertainment of a single fact, the 
rendering of an operative judgment upon the ascertainment 
of a fact should be committed to two separate tribunals, each 
acting independently of the other, and each having a veto 
upon the other. By that sort of tribunal no judicial function 
has ever been performed. We require unanimity in juries, 
that twelve men shall agree to a verdict, but they are one 
body; they consult and confer with each other, and they 
arrive at a conclusion as the result of that conference; but 
nobody ever proposed to have two juries to try a case. We 
have a court sometimes composed of an even number of 
judges, and the result may be a division between the judges, 
and there may be a provision or there may be none, for one 
or the other to rule the case; but it has never been that two 
courts having equal power can be charged with the 
determination of the same case.309 
Under Senator George's structural analogy, the number of jurors 
in the single body is precisely equal to the number of electors. This 
argument has some intuitive appeal. Indeed, the Democratic House 
of Representatives in 1884 passed a substitute version of the Electoral 
Count Act bill, which provided for the unicameral resolution of issues 
during the electoral count on a per capita vote basis, but the 
Democratic Senate did not agree.310 This is not to say that the 
unicameralisrn principle was uncontroversial. During the Electoral 
Count Act debates, there were Members of Congress who strongly 
objected to the unicameralism principle,311 and who believed that the

counting function should be exercised by the two Houses acting 
separately in their corporate capacities.312 
In sum, the unicameralism principle makes better sense, 
especially as a matter of immediacy, publicity, and jury-like structure. 
As we shall soon see, the unicameralism principle also avoids the 
presentment problem of the Electoral Count Act.313 
2. Where Is the Font of Power? 
As we have seen, the Electoral College Clauses are best 
interpreted as vesting the counting function in the joint convention 
and not the President of the Senate. Let us assume for present 
purposes that Congress may by law bind the joint convention in 
counting electoral votes-this assumption, as we shall see, is no small 
assumption.314 Where is the font of power to pass the Electoral Count 
Act? In a Constitution of enumerated and hence limited powers,315 
convention would be "wholly an unconstitutional assemblage" and that "I can find no 
ground to support this extra assemblage of the two Houses voting per capita"); 
Representative Caldwell remarked: 
It will be perceived that this bill is not predicated upon the idea of throwing the 
two Houses into convention and merging the smaller body, the Senate, into the 
larger body, the House of Representatives, and voting per capita. It is submitted 
that no constitutional warrant can be found for such an idea. 
18 CONG. REC. 31 (1886). Representative Herbert remarked: 
The words are not in the presence of the members of the Senate, or in the 
presence of the members of the House of Representatives, but in the presence of 
the Senate, which can only mean the organized Senate, and the House of 
Representatives, which can only mean the organized House of Representatives. 
Id. at 75. 
312. For example, Representative Caldwell stated that 
the action of the two Houses shall be separate and concurrent upon all questions 
of contest arising under the count, but joint as to results, thus preserving the 
dignity and rights of the two bodies by conceding to each equal and concurrent 
powers in counting and judging of the validity of electoral votes without merger 
of the lesser body into the numerically greater. 
18 CONG. REC. 31. Addtionally, 
[t]he separate concurrent action of both Houses provided for in the bill preserves 
the constitutional identity, rights, and dignity of each. This concession of each 
House to the other of equal and concurrent power to decide on informalities and 
illegalities appearing on the face of returns, upon objection of a Senator or 
Representative, is necessary to the determination of results.

we must ask ourselves under what clause or clauses Congress has the 
express or implied power to pass the Electoral Count Act. A 
dedicated constitutionalist cannot escape from asking this most basic 
question of the Electoral Count Act. 
There is, of course, no express power enabling Congress to pass 
the Electoral Count Act.316 There must therefore be some implied 
power enabling Congress to pass the Electoral Count Act; otherwise, 
it must be unconstitutional. There are only two options: the

Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 176 (1803) ("[T]hat those limits may not be mistaken, or 
forgotten, the constitution is written."). 
316. This easy textual point was, of course, made during the Electoral Count Act 
debates. For example, Senator Jones remarked that 
[t]he authority proposed to be given to the Senate and House of Representatives 
by this bill cannot surely be derived from any of the express powers of the 
Constitution. There is not a word said in the article which contains the delegated 
powers on this subject of counting the electoral votes. All that the Constitution 
says in regard to the electoral vote is to be found embodied in the second article. 
COUNTING ELECTORAL VOTES, supra note 3, at 596. 
317. U.S. CONST. art. I, § 8, cl. 18. 
318. The most recent scholars to address the Electoral Count Act state that "Congress 
probably has the power, when explicit constitutional requirements are violated, not to 
count elector votes" because Members of Congress take an oath or affirmation to support 
the Constitution. Ross & Josephson, supra note 7, at 713. This argument does not support 
the constitutionality of the Electoral Count Act unless the Oath or Affirmation Clause is 
the font of power for the Electoral Count Act-an interpretation that is devoid of any 
textual, historical, or structural support. 
It is also not at all clear whether Ross and Josephson believe that the Oath or 
Affirmation Clause is the font of congressional power or congressional duty to reject 
unconstitutional electoral votes. Their foregoing statement suggests the former, but two 
other statements suggest the latter. See id. ("Depending on the type of constitutional 
requirement and whether rejection of the vote would change the result of the election, 
Congress might have a duty, under the oath of office to which its members swear, to reject 
an elector vote that does not conform to the Constitution."); id. at 739 ("Under the oath 
each member takes, Congress must uphold constitutional requirements for presidential 
elections, particularly those that lie at the heart of the constitutionality of the process.") 
(emphasis added). If the Oath or Affirmation Clause is the font of congressional duty to 
reject unconstitutional electoral votes, they cannot be correct that that duty possibly turns 
"on the type of constitutional requirement and whether the rejection of the vote would 
change the result of the election." The duty to support the Constitution is absolute, not 
conditional. 
Moreover, the argument from the Oath or Affirmation Clause has almost no 
historical support: only one Member of Congress, to my knowledge, pointed to the Oath 
or Affirmation Clause as a font of congressional power over the electoral count. See 
COUNTING ELECTORAL VOTES, supra note 3, at 142 (remarks of Rep. Marshall) ("You 
are under oath to support the Constitution, and you cannot count a vote which violates 
that instrument, and is a breach of the privileges of the electoral colleges."). The  VP-R0000181_0080 
(2021-079) 
2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 
a. The Necessary and Proper Clause 1731 
The first possible font of congressional power to pass the 
Electoral Count Act is the Necessary and Proper Clause. The 
Necessary and Proper Clause provides that Congress shall have 
power "[t]o make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for 
carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers 
vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, 
or in any Department or Officer thereof."319 Scholars are split as to 
whether the Necessary and Proper Clause is a font of power for the 
Electoral Count Act.320 
A careful parsing of the Necessary and Proper Clause reveals 
that there are three prongs of power. Under the Clause, Congress has 
power for carrying into execution (1) "the foregoing Powers," (2) "all 
other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the 
United States," and (3) "all other Powers vested by this 
Constitution ... in any Department or Officer thereof."321 Which of 
these three prongs of the Necessary and Proper Clause will support 
Congress's power to enact the Electoral Count Act? 
We begin with the first prong. The phrase "foregoing Powers" 
obviously refers to the seventeen enumerated powers of Article I, 
argument has even less textual support: when we consult the text of the Oath or 
Affirmation Clause, we see that Members of Congress take an oath or affirmation to 
support the Constitution, but so do members of the state legislatures and executive and 
judicial Officers of the United States and of the several states. U.S. CONST. art. VI, cl. 3. 
Indeed, Senator Pinckney pointed to the oaths or affirmations taken by members of the 
state legislatures and state executives to argue against any congressional power to judge 
electoral votes. See, e.g., 10 ANNALS OF CONG. 131 (1800) ("Is not the Constitution the 
supreme Jaw of the land, and must not the State Legislatures conform their directions in 
the appointment of Electors to the directions of the Constitution?"). Senator Pinckney 
also remarked: 
Another serious objection to this bill, or to the exercise of this power, either by 
Congress or committee, is, that the Executives of the States and the State 
Legislatures are equally bound with Congress, by oath, "to support the 
Constitution;" it is an oath they all take at the commencement of each new 
Legislature. 
Id. at 144-45. The important point is that there is no textual justification for supposing 
that the Oath or Affirmation Clause gives Congress any special constitutional duty in the 
counting of the electoral vote. Cf. U.S. CONST. art. I, § 3, cl. 6 ("The Senate shall have the 
sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath 
or Affirmation."). 
319. U.S. CONST. art. I,§ 8, cl. 18. 
320. Compare Burgess, supra note 18, at 646 (concluding that the Necessary and 
Proper Clause is the font of power for the Electoral Count Act), with Ross & Josephson, 
supra note 7, at 714-15 (reaching opposite conclusion). 
321. As a matter of grammar and punctuation, it is arguable that there is no standalone 
second prong of the Necessary and Proper Clause, and that the second prong and third 
prong together constitute one prong.  VP-R0000181_0081

section 8,322 and the Electoral College Clauses of the original 
Constitution are not "foregoing Powers" in any way given their 
placement in Article II. The first prong of the Necessary and Proper 
Clause will not suffice as a font of power for the Electoral Count Act. 
Let us, for the moment, skip over the second prong and consider 
the third prong. The question is whether Congress (more precisely, 
the assemblage of the Senate and House of Representatives for the 
purposes of the electoral count) is a "Department [of the United 
States]" whose members are "Officer[s] [of the United States]."323 
The answer to this question is "No." Congress is not a "Department" 
and the Members of Congress are not "Officer[s]" within the meaning 
of the Necessary and Proper Clause. 
It is well settled that the Members of Congress are not "Officers 
of the United States."324 The best textual argument for this 
proposition is that Members of Congress are not subject to 
impeachment by the House of Representatives and conviction by the 
Senate because they are not "civil Officers of the United States."325 
Furthermore, the Ineligibility Clause of Article I, Section 6 provides 
that "no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a 
Member of either House during his Continuance in Office."326 Thus, 
322. U.S. CONST. art. I, § 8, els. 1-17; see also INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 983-84

Congress with the power 'to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for 
carrying into Execution the foregoing powers [the enumerated powers of § 8]' ") 
( alteration in original). 
323. Technically, the third prong of the Necessary and Proper Clause refers to 
"Department" or "Officer" and not to "Department of the United States" or "Officer of 
the United States." The phrase "of the United States" is fairly and necessarily attributed 
to both given the last word in the clause "thereof." See U.S. CONST. art. I, § 8, cl. 18 
(stating that Congress shall have power "[t]o make all Laws which shall be necessary and 
proper for carrying into Execution ... all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the 
Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof'). At least 
one scholar agrees that the word "Officer" in the Necessary and Proper Clause is "a 
synonym for the term of art 'Officer of the United States.' " Steven G. Calabresi, The 
Political Question of Presidential Succession, 48 STAN. L. REV. 155, 161 (1995).

the Members of Congress are not "Officer[s]" within the meaning of 
the Necessary and Proper Clause. 
The question remains whether Congress is a "Department [ of the 
United States]" within the meaning of the Necessary and Proper 
Clause, even if Members of Congress are not "Officer[ s] [ of the 
United States]" within the meaning of the same. This is a trickier 
question, but not one without an answer. The word "Department" in 
the Necessary and Proper Clause has a technical, term of art meaning. 
It does not refer to the generic legislative, executive, and judicial 
departments of the United States-as used in The Federalisi327 or in 
the early United States Reports328-but only refers to the specific 
executive and judicial departments of the United States. The 
Constitution itself suggests as much. The word "Department" does 
not appear elsewhere in Article I (which appertains to the legislative 
department in the colloquial sense) but in the Necessary and Proper 
Clause; the word does appear in two other clauses-the Opinion 
Clause329 and the second part of the Appointments Clause330-which 
refer to "executive Departments" and "Heads of Departments" 
respectively. Nowhere is the word "Department" used in the 
Constitution to refer to the legislative, executive, or judicial 
department in the colloquial sense. 
There are at least a few other considerations which militate 
against finding that Congress is a "Department" within the meaning 
of the Necessary and Proper Clause. First, it would be very strange 
at 492 ("The last clause rendering a Seat in the Legislature & an office incompatible was 
agreed to nem: con:.") (emphasis added).

(but perhaps not unthlnkable) for Members of Congress not to be 
"Officer[s]," but for Congress to be a "Department" within the 
meaning of the Necessary and Proper Clause. The logical argument is 
that "If Department, then Officer" is true, then "If not-Officer, then 
not-Department" is also true. The Necessary and Proper Clause 
ostensibly relates to "Officers" who are "Officers of Departments" 
who are, in turn, "Officers of Departments of the United States," or 
simply "Officers ... of the United States." Second, if Congress is a 
"Department" withln the meaning of the Necessary and Proper 
Clause, then Congress would be able to legislate with respect to itself 
on matters concerning its own powers.331 Such legislation flies in the 
face of constitutional text. The Rules of Proceedings Clause makes 
explicit that "[e]ach House may determine the Rules of its 
Proceedings."332 Congress may not therefore enact rules of 
proceedings for Congress or each House thereof by statute.333 Such 
legislation also violates constitutional structure. The separation of 
the two Houses of Congress in the exercise of its powers-in a word, 
bicameralism-is a critical structural feature of Article I designed to 
check legislative tyranny.334 Moreover, constitutional structure 
suggests that Congress may not bind itself or future Congresses in the 
exercise of its own powers.335 Third, the prevailing interpretation of 
the third prong of the Necessary and Proper Clause appears to be that 
it only refers to the executive and judicial departments of the United 
States.336 Thus, Congress (more precisely, the assemblage of the

"Officers" within the meaning of the Necessary and Proper Clause. 
The third prong of the Necessary and Proper Clause also will not 
suffice as a font of power for the Electoral Count Act.338 
Only the second prong of the Necessary and Proper Clause 
remains: Congress shall have power "[t]o make all Laws which shall 
be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution . . . all other 
Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United 
States."339 The question is thus whether the counting function is one

337. Although this body is technically not "Congress," the argument that this body is 
not a "Department" whose members are "Officer[s]" within the meaning of the Necessary 
and Proper Clause is largely analogous to the argument set forth above concerning 
Congress. The members of this body are the Members of Congress, and this body is not 
an executive or judicial department of the United States whose officers (with the 
exception of the President and Vice President) are appointed pursuant to the 
Appointments Clause, U.S. CONST. art. II,§ 2, cl. 2. 
338. Professor Rosenthal believes the Necessary and Proper Clause is the font of 
congressional power not to count the electoral votes of faithless electors. See Rosenthal, 
supra note 221, at 32. His fatal mistake is that he believes that Members of Congress are 
"Officers of the United States." See id. ("The power to count electoral votes is a power 
vested in the President of the Senate and the members of both [H]ouses of Congress, all of 
whom are officers of the United States."). 
Similarly, during the Electoral Count Act debates, Senator Edmunds believed that 
Congress was a "Department" within the meaning of the Necessary and Proper Clause. 
His words leave no doubt on this construction: 
The Constitution of the United States vests powers and duties in all the three 
great departments of the Government. It then provides that Congress shall have 
the power to pass all laws necessary to carry into effect the provisions of the 
Constitution and the powers invested in any of its several departments . 
. . . [I]f under your general power of regulation which the Constitution gives 
you of carrying into effect its powers you may provide how the Supreme Court 
shall exercise its functions, how the Executive shall exercise his functions 
carrying out the duties that the Constitution has imposed upon him, may you not 
also do the same thing when, assuming that to be the true construction of the 
Constitution, the two houses are to meet and witness the counting of these votes 
and to decide upon them? It seems to me that no man can considerately answer 
that question in the negative.

339. Again, this begs the question whether there is a standalone second prong of the 
Necessary and Proper Clause. See supra note 321. The only power vested by the 
Constitution in the "Government of the United States" as an undifferentiated whole (in 
contrast to powers vested in specific parts thereof) is that (arguably) under the Guarantee 
Clause. See U.S. CONST. art. IV, § 4 ("The United States shall guarantee to every State in 
this Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against 
Invasion; and on Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature  VP-R0000181_0085

of the "Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the 
United States." 
The textual evidence strongly militates against such a finding. 
Consider again the text of the Electoral College Clauses: "The 
President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House 
of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall then be 
counted."340 Obviously, the Electoral College Clauses do not employ 
the word "Power," unlike two other clauses outside of Article I, 
section 8 which do employ the word "Power" with respect to 
Congress-the Treason Clause and Territories Clause.341 Moreover, 
the text and tenor of the Electoral College Clauses suggest duty and 
not discretion implied by the word "Power"-hence the use of the 
word "shall," and more interestingly, the use of passive voice. 
There are, however, several clauses outside of Article I, section 8 
where Congress has "Power" in the Article I, section 8 sense of the 
word, but which do not employ the word "Power." But these clauses 
make clear that Congress has legislative power by employing the 
phrase "may by law" or the phrase "shall by law" or their close 
variants. In the original Constitution, we need only to look to the 
Times, Places, and Manner Clause,342 Presidential Succession 
Clause,343 the second part of the Appointments Clause,344 the Jury

the former; and to the Census Clause,347 the Congress Meeting 
Clause,348 and the first part of the Appointments Clause349 as 
examples of the latter. But, unlike these several clauses, there is no 
"may by law" or "shall by law" provision modifying the counting 
function.350 
When the Constitution commits "Power" to Congress outside of 
Article I, Section 8, it says so. It is more than doubtful that the seven 
word phrase "and the votes shall then be counted" is one of the 
"Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United 
States" ,vithin the meaning of the Necessary and Proper Clause.351 As

Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United 
States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be 
established by Law .... ") (emphasis added). 
350. Another example that does not neatly fit into the "may by law" or "shall by law" 
categories is the Congress Compensation Clause. U.S. CONST. art. I, § 6, cl. 1 ("The 
Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be 
ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.") (emphasis 
added). 
351. Nevertheless, a few scholars recently describe the counting phrase of the Electoral 
College Clauses as the "congressional counting power," see Coenen & Larson, supra note 
18, at 909-16, or the "counting power," see Barkow, supra note 17, at 278-79, 284,286,288 
(2002). This phraseology is wrong, at least insofar as the word "Power" is used in the 
Constitution. The word "power" implies discretion to do or not do something. The 
Electoral College Clauses are devoid of "power"; they direct the counting agent to count 
what-are-the-electoral-votes and not to count what-are-not-the-electoral-votes-nothing 
less and nothing more. (The scope of what-are-the-electoral-votes is discussed in Part III 
infra.) The phraseology is also odd considering that Professors Coenen and Larson 
acknowledge that "[t]here is not ... a congressional power to count votes; there is a 
congressional duty," Coenen & Larson, supra note 18, at 910, emphasizing the word 
"shall" and the passive voice of the phrase "be counted" in the text of the counting phrase, 
see id. at n.298. Notably, Professors Coenen and Larson reject the argument that the 
counting phrase of the Electoral College Oauses is one of the "Powers vested by this 
Constitution in the Government of the United States," U.S. CONST. art. I, § 8, cl. 18, and 
hence not within the meaning of the Necessary and Proper Oause:  VP-R0000181_0087

1738 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 80 
a matter of principled textual interpretation, the second prong of the 
Necessary and Proper Clause also will not suffice as a font of power 
to enact the Electoral Count Act. 
* * * 
What about the historical interpretation of the Necessary and 
Proper Clause? To be sure, the questions of whether the counting 
function is one of the "Powers vested by this Constitution in the 
Government of the United States" within the meaning of the 
Necessary and Proper Clause and whether the Necessary and Proper 
Clause is the font of power for congressional regulation of the 
electoral count has been the subject of significant debate by Members 
of Congress. These questions were controversial from the first. 
The Senate of the Sixth Congress first debated these questions in 
considering the Grand Committee Bill.352 After Federalist Senator 
Ross moved to appoint a committee authorized to report a bill, 
Senator Brown disagreed. He "was of opinion that this was a subject 
on which Congress had no right to legislate. When the Constitution 
undertook to make provisions on a subject, if they were found 
incomplete, or defective, they must be remedied by recommending an 
amendment to the Constitution."353 Federalist Senator Dexter 
expressed no doubt that the Necessary and Proper Clause authorized 
legislation on the subject. "The law now proposed," said Dexter, 
We would reject this first argument on the theory that the vesting of a duty, 
particularly one as important as determining the identity of our President, 
inescapably carries with it the grant of a "power" in the sense that the word is 
used in the Necessary and Proper Clause. Indeed, we think that there is a strong 
a fortiori argument to be made here. If Congress can do anything appropriate to 
carry into effect powers it may (but need not) exercise, does it not logically 
follow that it can do anything appropriate to carry out those powers it has no 
choice but to wield? The recognition of the existence of less urgently needed 
powers logically dictates the recognition of more urgently needed powers as well. 
Coenen & Larson, supra note 18, at 910 (footnotes omitted). This argument fails to 
persuade for at least a few reasons. First, this argument overlooks the linguistic meaning 
of the word "Power" as employed in the Necessary and Proper Clause and the rest of the 
original Constitution. Second, this argument does not grapple with the argument that 
Congress may not legislate with respect to itself under the Necessary and Proper Clause, 
see text accompanying supra notes 331-38. Third, this argument mischaracterizes the 
Necessary and Proper Clause as a broad-based grant of power to carry into effect all 
duties imposed on Congress, or for that matter, on the executive and judicial departments 
of the federal government. If Congress "can do anything appropriate to carry into effect 
powers it may (but need not) exercise," Coenen and Larson, supra note 18, at 910 
( emphasis added), what about Congress doing anything appropriate to carry into effect 
those "powers" (read duties) that the executive and judicial departments possess but have 
no choice but to wield?

"appears to be necessary to carry into effect the power of appointing 
the President; it is therefore clearly Constitutional."354 His argument 
may be that just as certain powers may give rise to implied powers, 
certain duties may give rise to implied powers reasonably necessary to 
give effect to those duties. 
Was Senator Dexter correct? Is there a "power of appointing the 
President" in the Electoral College Clauses? So too Federalist 
Senator Livermore "never felt less doubt on any subject that the one 
now under consideration: the Constitution has given many directions 
to the appointment of the President, some of which he read."355 
Unfortunately, the recorded debate does not indicate what provisions 
Senator Livermore read-perhaps for good reason. There is nothing 
in the Electoral College Clauses that suggests that Congress has any 
power to regulate the electoral count Senator Baldwin, who was a 
Framer at the Philadelphia Convention, disagreed with the 
Federalists on virtually every point. In a detailed speech, much of 
which we shall uncover in the course of the structural argument, 
Senator Baldwin stated that the Federalists' efforts to regulate the 
electoral count "must be made by proposing an amendment to the 
Constitution to that effect; and that they could not be made by law, 
without violating the Constitution."356 In other words, there was no 
express or implied power in the Constitution to regulate the electoral 
count by law. Senator Baldwin took particular issue with Senator 
Dexter's conception of the Necessary and Proper Clause. Senator 
Baldwin explained that the Necessary and Proper Clause 
speaks of the use of the powers vested by the Constitution­
this resolution relates to the formation of a competent and 
essential part of the Government itself: that speaks of the 
movements of the Government after it is organized; this 
relates to the organization of the Executive branch, and is 
therefore clearly a Constitutional work, and to be done, if at 
all, in the manner pointed out by the Constitution, by 
proposing an article of amendment to the Constitution on 
that subject.357 
Senator Baldwin's statement is a particularly fine textual 
meditation based on the word "vested" in the Necessary and Proper 
Clause. If we look intratextually, we see that the word "vested" 
appears alongside the word "Power" in each of the Vesting Clauses of

Articles I, II, and III.358 If the second prong of the Necessary and 
Proper Clause is a placeholder of sorts for the legislative, executive, 
and judicial powers of the United States read as a whole, then the 
second prong cannot support the Electoral Count Act. The Electoral 
College Clauses are not a part of the legislative power or the judicial 
power, and as Senator Baldwin keenly observed, they are not a part 
of ( and are antecedent to) the executive power. 
The Necessary and Proper Clause resurfaced some twenty years 
later in the regulation of the electoral count. In December of 1820, 
approximately two months before the electoral count of 1821, Senator 
Wilson introduced a resolution entitled, "Attempt to Remedy the 
Uncertainty as to Counting the Electoral Vote by Legislation. "359 He 
discussed the Necessary and Proper Clause as the font of 
congressional power to regulate the electoral count and stated that 
Congress has unquestionably the power, under the last 
clause of the eighth section of the first article of the 
Constitution, and he thought they ought to exercise it by 
vesting the authority to decide upon doubtful, disputed, or 
unlawful votes, either in the President of the Senate, the 
Senate itself, the House of Representatives, or the two 
houses conjointly or separately.360 
This statement reflects some serious problems with the scope of 
congressional power to regulate the electoral count under the 
Necessary and Proper Clause. Even if Congress may enact counting 
legislation under the Necessary and Proper Clause vesting the 
"counting power" in both Houses of Congress ( conjointly or 
separately), how may Congress vest such power in either House 
alone? And how may Congress vest such power in the President of 
the Senate, possibly expanding the constitutional duties of the Vice 
President? The Committee of the Judiciary, which considered 
Senator Wilson's resolution, seemed to think that counting legislation 
was constitutional but merely inexpedient, and hence Senator 
Wilson's resolution was not acted upon.361

Little was said about the application of the Necessary and Proper 
Clause to counting electoral votes in the years immediately following 
1820. Senator Van Buren introduced a bill in the Senate in 1824 that 
was very similar to the Electoral Count Act.362 Senator Macon did 
not think that this bill was necessary or constitutional and argued that 
"Congress had no power to legislate upon the subject" of Senator 
Van Buren's bill.363 This bill passed the Senate but the House never 
considered it. 
During the Wisconsin Incident of 1857, Senator Hunter invoked 
the Necessary and Proper Clause as the font of power "to regulate by 
law the details of the mode in which the votes are to be counted. "364 
But Senator Collamer expressed his serious doubts that Congress 
could legislate on the Wisconsin problem: "I very much doubt 
whether the [F]ramers of the Constitution ever intended to leave the 
subject of the presidential election to the House of Representatives, 
or the Senate, or either, or both of them."365 This statement echoes 
Senator Wilson's observations on the scope of congressional power to 
regulate the electoral count under the Necessary and Proper Clause. 
During the Electoral Count Act debates, the Members of 
Congress repeatedly pointed to the Necessary and Proper Clause as 
the font of power to pass the Electoral Count Act. It does appear 
that these Members of Congress relied on this clause as the font of 
power to pass the Electoral Count Act.366 As Professors Issacharoff,

opinion that it is inexpedient at this time to legislate on this subject").

provision of the Constitution, to count the votes for President and Vice-President."). 
Senator Sherman argued: 
Congress has undoubted power under the residuary clause in the Constitution 
giving powers to Congress to pass all laws suitable and necessary to carry into 
execution the express grants of power. Here is a provision in the Constitution 
for the election of electors, and therefore the mode and manner by which the 
votes of electors may be counted may be pointed out, but Congress shall not 
provide that the votes shall not be counted, because the Constitution says that 
the votes shall be counted then and there.

Karlan, and Pilde& conclude, "A majority of Congress was persuaded 
by the argument that the Act was permitted under the Necessary and 
Proper Clause to give substance to the provisions of the Twelfth 
Amendment."367 
There were, of course, those who disagreed with this 
interpretation of the Necessary and Proper Clause. For example, 
Representative Browne explicitly denied that the counting function 
was a "power" in the Article I, Section 8 sense of the word-a point 
that would implicitly apply to the word "power" in the Necessary and 
Proper Clause as well: 
The [F]ramers of the Constitution withheld from Congress 
the power to interfere with this count; they withheld it by 
not committing the power to do it. When the Constitution 
confers a power it does so in express words, as Congress 
shall have power to borrow money, collect taxes, regulate 
commerce, coin money, and the like. By no words, by no 
implication, has the power been given Congress to settle 
questions concerning the electoral count.368 
Congress of power to provide for carrying into effect the power to open and count the 
votes of the electors lodged in the President of the Senate."). Representative Eden 
remarked: 
In providing by law a method to insure a fair count of the electoral vote we need 
exercise no doubtful powers. The Constitution requires the vote to be counted. 
I assume that Congress has the authority under the Constitution to pass all laws 
necessary to carry into effect that mandate of the Constitution. 
Id. at 50. Representative Herbert made the point that 
[T]he Constitution vests in the Federal Government the power to count the

the Federal Government. . . . A power has been given, and it is perfectly plain 
that the Constitution vests in Congress the power to enact what legislation is

necessary to carry out certain powers; but those powers are defined. It has the 
power to carry out its own express grants of power. It has the right to pass laws 
concerning any act of the Federal Government; but the election of a President is 
not an act of the Federal Government, but is the action of the State Government. 
It has the right to pass laws concerning what any Federal officer shall do or what 
any Federal department shall do; but there its power is exhausted. So that 
Congress has no power in relation to the electoral vote except to count, in the 
sense of enumeration.  VP-R0000181_0092

2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 1743 
And Senator Wilson made known his belief that "defects in the 
Constitution of the United States can not be remedied by acts of 
Congress."369 At a minjmum, several Members of Congress, including 
those who voted for the Electoral Count Act, had significant doubts 
with respect to its constitutionality. 
The Necessary and Proper Clause is not a font of power for the 
Electoral Count Act. The counting function is neither one of the 
"foregoing Powers," nor "Powers vested by this Constitution in the 
Government of the United States," nor "Powers vested by this 
Constitution ... in any Department or Officer [of the United States]" 
within the meaning of the Necessary and Proper Clause. Put 
differently, congressional regulation of the electoral count, however 
"necessary," is not "proper"-and hence not within Congress's 
domain or jurisdiction-within the meaning of the Necessary and 
Proper Clause.370 In case there should be any doubt on this point, the 
structural argument makes clear that doubt should be resolved 
against Congress in the specific context of presidential election.371 
The Electoral Count Act treads on terribly thin textual ground vis-a.­
vis the Necessary and Proper Clause, and to the only remaining 
possible font of implied power, we now turn. 
b. The Electoral College Clauses 
The second possible font of congressional power to enact the 
Electoral Count Act is the Electoral College Clauses themselves. 
There are at least two historical precedents for this supposition. First, 
the First Congress encountered the very tricky problem of specifying 
the oath or affirmation for state legislators and officers under the 
369. 17 CONG. REC. 1058; see also id. at 1059 (arguing that "a power vested by the 
Constitution [cannot] be divested by legislative action"). Senator Ingalls fervently stated 
in words that ring true today: 
Careful consideration of this subject will convince any thoughtful student of the 
Constitution that the scheme which has been devised and which now remains in 
our organic law is fatally defective, and that nothing can be done by way of 
legislation to cure the inevitable evils by which it is surrounded, and the more we 
proceed by legislation to patch, to bridge over apparent difficulties, to abbreviate 
the number of perils which surround it, by so much we retard and delay the 
exercise of the power which the people must ultimately be called upon to 
perform in adopting some system that shall remove the perils in which it is now 
environed.

Affirmation Clause is not a foregoing power or one of the powers 
vested by the Constitution in the government of the United States, 
and state legislators and officers are by definition not officers of the 
United States. The First Congress simply concluded that the Oath or 
Affirmation Clause was "self-executing," and prescribed an oath or 
affirmation for these persons anyway.373 Second, much later, the 
Supreme Court affirmed Congress's ability to enact legislation under 
the Fugitive Slave Clause which appears to be self-executing.374 The 
rationale for this decision was that the Fugitive Slave Act is a "direct 
implementation" of the Fugitive Slave Clause and therefore does not 
go beyond the provisions of the clause.375 
What does this mean for the Electoral Count Act? Two 
questions arise: whether some congressional regulation of the 
electoral count may be sustained under the Electoral College Clauses 
and whether the Electoral Count Act may be sustained under the 
Electoral College Clauses.376

375. See Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 909 (1997). But oddly, and in what is a 
most tortured interpretation of the Constitution, the Supreme Court has held that 
legislation which is not a "direct implementation" of the Fugitive Slave Clause-that is, 
legislation that goes beyond the substance and procedure of the clause-is a constitutional 
exercise of congressional power under the Full Faith and Credit Clause which provides 
that "Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records, 
and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof." U.S. CONST. art. IV, § 1; see

2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 1745 
Article II, Section 1, Clause 3 and the Twelfth Amendment seem 
to be at least as self-executing as the Oath or Affirmation Clause or 
the Fugitive Slave Clause. Indeed, Article II, Section 1, Clause 3 is by 
far the longest "clause" in the original Constitution, containing 
approximately 290 words, compared to the next longest clause with 
approximately 165.377 These two clauses look more like technical 
rules than the open-textured provisions such as the Privileges and 
Immunities Clause, Due Process Clause, and Equal Protection Clause 
of the Fourteenth Amendment.378 These two clauses could hardly be 
more prolix for constitutional provisions. Professor Gardner offers 
the fallowing account: 
Presumably, these detailed instructions reflect society's 
determination that the use of the particular process set forth 
will assure a result sufficiently accurate to justify society's 
consent to the winner.... This provision of the 
Constitution is unusual: it is rare for the people to dictate in 
such detail the manner in which they would like things done. 
More typical is article I, section 4, governing congressional 
1 ' 379 e ect1ons .... 
In addition to this point of prolixity, consider also that the 
Electoral College Clauses, and especially the Twelfth Amendment, 
contain no special provision empowering Congress to enforce it by 
appropriate legislation, in contrast to a host of other ( and admittedly 
later) amendments to the Constitution.380 
Apparently, the Second Congress did not think that Article II, 
Section 1, Clause 3 was fully self-executing given the regulations on 
the manner of certifying and transmitting electoral votes.381 However, 
it is unclear whether the Second Congress based these regulations on 
the implied power of Article II, Section 1, Clause 4 and or of Article 
II, Section 1, Clause 3. Recall that the draft of Article II, Section 1, 
Clause 4 at the Philadelphia Convention provided that "[t]he 
Legislature may determine the time of choosing the electors, and of 
their giving their votes; and the manner of certifying and transmitting 
their votes-But the election shall be on the same day throughout the

U--States"382 and that the italicized language was inexplicably 
dropped.383 To be sure, regulations on the manner of certifying and 
transmitting their votes do not support regulations on the electoral 
count. 
The problem of binding future joint conventions aside,384 some 
congressional regulation of the electoral count may easily be 
supported under the Electoral College Clauses. For example, a 
regulation providing that the joint convention count electoral votes in 
the alphabetical order of States in the Union probably would be 
constitutionally acceptable. The real issue is whether Congress had 
the legislative authority to pass the Electoral Count Act in the first 
place. 
The Electoral Count Act goes well beyond the text of the 
Electoral College Clauses. The Electoral Count Act is by no means a 
"direct implementation" of the Electoral College Clauses. During the 
Electoral Count Act debates, Senator Jones made the argument from 
prolixity that Congress did not have the power to legislate: 
That [ second] article provides the mode and manner of 
returning and counting that vote. If it was intended that 
Congress should exercise authority over this subject by 
general legislation, why is it that the Constitution, instead of 
giving as in other cases a general power to Congress, has 
anticipated such legislation by a lengthy provision specifying 
particularly the manner in which the voice of the electors 
shall be ascertained? It was not the intention of the 
Constitution to leave to Congress the power to determine 
how the President and Vice-President should be elected. 
This is clearly indicated by the express words of the first 
section of the second article.385 
It is more than doubtful that the Electoral Count Act could be 
sustained as a direct implementation of the Electoral College Clauses. 
If the Electoral Count Act passes constitutional muster as a direct 
implementation of the Electoral College Clauses, it is most difficult to 
see what would constitute an indirect-and constitutionally­
impermissible-implementation of those clauses.

c. Textual Arguments from Negative Implication 1747 
Two textual arguments from negative implication cast additional 
doubt upon any font of congressional power for the Electoral Count 
Act, and particularly the implied font of congressional power of the 
Electoral College Clauses itself. When the Constitution contemplates 
a legislative role for Congress with respect to the Presidency, it says 
so-twice. 
First, consider Article II, Section 1, Clause 4 which provides that 
"[t]he Congress may determine the Time of chusing the Electors, and 
the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the 
same throughout the United States."386 This clause contains the sole 
grant of power to Congress in the Electoral College Clauses. The 
argument from negative implication gains momentum when we 
remember that the Electoral College Clauses were drafted as a whole. 
Indeed, the original draft of Article II, Section 1, Clause 4 was a part 
of Article II, Section 1, Clause 3 which contains the counting 
function.387 There is little reason to believe that the omission of any 
express legislative power in Article II, Section 1, Clause 3 was 
accidental. 
Senator Eaton made much of the negative implication during the 
Electoral Count Act debates: 
Turn over to paragraph 3 of the same section and what do 
you find there? The only power that Congress has is here: 
"The Congress"-may do what? After the state has done its 
duty, "The Congress may determine"-what? "The time of 
choosing the electors and the day on which they shall give 
their votes; which day shall be the same throughout the 
United States." That is all the power. The very keeping of 
that power excludes every other idea of power. Every other 
idea of power belongs to the states, is in the states.388

387. See 2 FARRAND, supra note 35, at 497-98. 
388. Burgess, supra note 18, at 636 ( emphasis added). Senator Jones made a similar 
point: 
This clause shows that they weighed this subject with great care, and that they 
thought it necessary not to leave to Congress any implied power over the 
election of President. 
Now, sir, the power to decide whether the votes of two or ten States shall or 
shall not be counted is a far more important and delicate power than that given 
to Congress in express terms to fix the time of choosing the electors. And am I 
not warranted in saying that, if the Constitution intended that Congress should 
have any more extended power than is conferred by this clause, it would have 
said so in plain language?

Second, consider the Presidential Succession Clause of Article II 
which provides that 
[i]n Case of the Removal of the President from Office, or of 
his Death, Resignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers 
and Duties of the said Office, the Same shall devolve on the 
Vice President, and the Congress may by Law provide for 
the Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both 
of the President and Vice President, declaring what Officer 
shall then act as President, and such Officer shall act 
accordingly, until the Disability be removed, or a President 
shall be elected.389 
This clause too was placed alongside the Electoral College 
Clauses in the Framers' draft Constitution and was later rearranged 
by the Committee of Style.390 There is little reason to believe that the 
omission of any express legislative power in Article II, Section 1, 
Clause 3 was accidental. 
The prolix Electoral College Clauses provide that "the Votes 
shall then be counted"-not, "the Votes shall then be counted as 
Congress may by Law have directed." The Framers could have so 
provided but they did not. 
3. The Intratextual Argument 
There is more to the textual argument against the Electoral 
Count Act than the sparse words of the Electoral College Clauses­
much more. An Article II-centric focus on presidential election is too 
narrow. We can squeeze yet more meaning from the Electoral 
College Clauses and Congress's role in presidential election when we 
consider the text of the Constitution as a coherent whole. When we 
do so, we see that Congress has a role in presidential election, but 
Congress has a role in congressional elections as well. We may obtain 
important clues about Congress's role in presidential election by 
comparing and contrasting it with Congress's role in congressional 
elections. This intratextual analysis reveals two arguments that 
strongly militate against the constitutionality of the Electoral Count 
Act. These two arguments relate to two clauses in Article I: the 
Times, Places, and Manner Clause and the House Judging Clause.

(2021-079) 
2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 
a. The Times, Places, and Manner Clause 1749 
When the Constitution contemplates a "regulating" role for 
Congress in elections, it says so. The Times, Places, and Manner 
Clause provides that "[t]he Times, Places and Manner of holding 
Elections for Senators and Representatives shall be prescribed in 
each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any 
time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places 
of chusing Senators."391 
The Times, Places, and Manner Clause is the font of significant 
congressional power over congressional elections-so significant that 
Alexander Hamilton devoted three essays of The Federalist to the 
clause in order to defend it from criticism from Anti-Federalists and 
Federalists alike.392 Indeed, several State ratifying conventions 
proposed amendments to the Constitution to amend the Times, 
Places, and Manner Clause so as to eliminate the proviso empowering 
Congress to regulate congressional elections.393 
Importantly, no such clause empowering Congress to regulate 
presidential election appears in Article II. A careful reading of the 
Electoral College Clauses reveals an important point. As we have 
seen, Article II, section 1, clause 4 provides that "[t]he Congress may 
determine the Time of chusing the Electors, and the Day on which 
they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout 
the United States."394 This clause supplies the only grant of power to 
391. U.S. CONST. art. I,§ 4, cl. 1 (emphasis added). 
392. For example, Alexander Hamilton wrote: 
This provision has not only been declaimed against by those who condemn the 
Constitution in the gross; but it has been censured by those who have objected 
with less latitude and greater moderation; and, in one instance, it has been 
thought exceptionable by a gentleman who had declared himself the advocate of 
every other part of the system. 
THE FEDERALIST No. 59, at 330 (Alexander Hamilton) (Clinton Rossiter ed., Mentor 
1999) (1961). See generally THE FEDERALIST Nos. 59-61 (Alexander Hamilton) 
( discussing the regulation of congressional elections). 
393. E.g., 3 ELLIOT'S DEBATES, supra note 250, at 661 (Virginia ratifying convention) 
("Congress shall not alter, modify, or interfere in the times, places, or manner of holding 
elections for senators and representatives or either of them, except when the legislature of 
any state shall neglect, refuse, or be disabled, by invasion or rebellion, to prescribe the 
same.''); see 2 id. at 552 (Maryland ratifying convention) (similar); 2 id. at 545 
(Pennsylvania ratifying convention) (similar); 3 id. at 246 (North Carolina ratifying 
convention) (similar). 
394. U.S. CONST. art. III, § 1, cl. 4 (emphasis added). This clause may be the font of 
congressional power to regulate the manner of presidential election. For example, 
Professor Amar has suggested that, pursuant to this clause and general "electioneering" 
rules, "Congress could prohibit-either directly, or through conditional funding rules for 
any party that seeks federal election funds-any direct effort to lobby electors between 
Election Day and Electoral College Meeting Day by anyone other than the candidates  VP-R0000181_0099 
(2021-079) 
1750 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 80 
Congress in presidential election and the clause empowers Congress 
only with respect to "Time." The Constitution itself fixes the 
"Places" with the electors "meet[ing] in their respective States."395 
What about "Manner"? In stark contrast to congressional election, 
Congress has no power with respect to the "Manner" of presidential 
election. Article II, section 1, clause 2 provides that "[e]ach State 
shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a 
Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and 
Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress." 
Interestingly, Alexander Hamilton's private, unadopted draft of the 
Constitution provided that "[t]he Legislature shall by permanent laws 
provide such further regulations as may be necessary for the more 
orderly election of the President, not contravening the provisions 
herein contained,"396 but no such provision was the subject of 
recorded debate at the Philadelphia Convention of 1787. 
What does the Times, Places, and Manner Clause mean for the 
Electoral Count Act? The implications of the intratextual argument 
are incredibly straightforward. There is little reason to suppose that 
the word "Manner" in the Times, Places, and Manner Clause has a 
substantially different meaning from the word "Manner" in Article II, 
Section 1, Clause 2.397 Whatever the scope of Congress's power to 
prescribe the manner of congressional elections, Congress has no such 
power in presidential election. 
The marked silence of the founding generation on the issue of 
presidential election in contrast to congressional election strongly 
suggests that they understood presidential election to be free from 
congressional regulation. Unsurprisingly, the intratextual argument 
featured prominently in the constitutional debate over the Grand 
Committee Bill. In March of 1800, Senator Pinckney seized the 
intratextual argument from the Times, Places, and Manner Clause in 
his lengthy speech against the Grand Committee Bill. Read carefully 
his intratextual argument: 
Let us for a moment compare [ the Times, Places, and 
Manner Clause] with the directions of the Constitution 
themselves, or their direct agents." Amar, supra note 10, at 231 n.22. Such laws further 
the independence of electors and moreover do not operate on electors directly. But the 
existence of a constitutional power in one direction does not imply the existence of a 
power in the equal-and-opposite direction.

2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 
respecting the Electors of a President, and then permit me to 
call your attention to the remarkable difference there is 
between them, and the reasons for this difference. 
By the Constitution, Electors of a President are to be chosen 
in the manner directed by the State Legislatures-that is all 
that is said. In case the State Legislatures refuse to make 
these directions there is no power to compel them; there is 
not a single word in the Constitution which can, by the most 
tortured construction, be extended to give Congress, or any 
branch or part of our Federal Government, a right to make 
or alter the State Legislatures' directions on this subject. 
The right to make these directions is complete and 
conclusive, subject to no control or revision, and placed 
entirely with them, for the best and most unanswerable 
reasons.398 1751 
Senator Pinckney argued that the Grand Committee Bill was 
unconstitutional because it was an impermissible congressional 
regulation of the manner of presidential election. If Senator Pinckney 
is correct, it follows that the Electoral Count Act is also 
unconstitutional. Senator Pinckney is correct. Congressional 
regulation of the electoral count is a regulation on the manner of 
presidential election. The two key sections of the Electoral Count 
Act-3 U.S.C. § 5 and 3 U.S.C. § 15-regulate the manner in which 
the acts of the electors will be given effect. 
The intratextual argument also has powerful implications for the 
question of whether there is a font of power for Congress to enact the 
Electoral Count Act. Imagine for a moment that the amendments 
proposed by several state ratifying conventions eliminating the 
proviso of the Times, Places, and Manner Clause empowering 
Congress to regulate congressional elections399 had been adopted. 
There would be no question that Congress would then have zero 
power over the manner of congressional election. The power to 
implement this amended Times, Places, and Manner Clause is not a 
"Power vested in this Constitution in the Government of the United 
States" under the Necessary and Proper Clause. In other words, 
Congress derives its sole power to regulate congressional elections 
from the proviso of the Times, Places, and Manner Clause. Congress

may not claim that the Necessary and Proper Clause is the font of 
power for regulating the manner of presidential election. 
In sum, the intratextual argument from the Times, Places, and 
Manner Clause makes clear that Congress has near zero power over 
the manner of presidential election and raises serious doubts as to 
Congress's font of power to enact the Electoral Count Act. 
b. The House Judging Clause 
When the Constitution contemplates a judging role for each 
House of Congress in elections, it says so. The House Judging Clause 
provides that "[e]ach House shall be the Judge of the Elections, 
Returns and Qualifications of its own Members."400 The House 
Judging Clause is the font of awesome powers and duties. Under this 
clause, each House is a judicial tribunal with the judicial power to 
investigate the elections of its Members,401 and has the duty to refuse 
to seat members who are constitutionally ineligible to the office of 
Representative or Senator.402 
Importantly, no such clause appears in Article II concerning 
presidential election.403 The negative implication is made more stark 
by the fact that the House Judging Clause was considered 
immediately after the drafting of the Electoral College Clauses at the 
Philadelphia Convention of 1787, but no Framer thought to extend 
the principle of the House Judging Clause to presidential election.404 
What does the House Judging Clause mean for the Electoral 
Count Act? The negative implication of the House Judging Clause is 
that the joint convention does not have the authority to judge the 
elections, returns, and qualifications of electors. The joint convention 
is not a judicial tribunal with the power to investigate the manner of 
appointment and qualifications of electors, and may not refuse to 
count electoral votes contained in authentic electoral certificates for 
400. U.S. CONST. art. I, § 5, cl. 1. 
401. See, e.g., Barry v. United States ex rel. Cunningham, 279 U.S. 597, 613 (1928) 
(holding that the Constitution confers upon Congress certain powers that are "judicial in 
character," including the "power to judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of its 
own members," and "[i]n exercising this power, the Senate may, of course, devolve upon a 
committee of its members the authority to investigate and report; and this is the general, if 
not the uniform, practice"). 
402. See U.S. CONST. art. I,§ 2, cl. 2 (House Qualifications Clause); U.S. CONST. art. I, 
§ 3, cl. 3 (Senate Qualifications Clause); U.S. CONST. art. VI, cl. 3 (Oath or Affirmation 
Clause). 
403. At least one other scholar has noted this obvious point. See Harrison, supra note 
23, at 702.

2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 1753 
reasons relating to the manner of appointment or qualifications of 
electors.405 
These conclusions find support in the purpose of the House 
Judging Clause. Justice Story, in his Commentaries on the 
Constitution of the United States, explained that the power to judge 
the elections, returns, and qualifications of the members of each 
House must be lodged somewhere in order to safeguard the liberties 
of the people.406 The only question was where to place such a power. 
Justice Story concluded that the power is best lodged in the body 
whose elections, returns and qualifications are to be judged and not in 
some other body. "If lodged in any other, than the legislative body 
itself," wrote Justice Story, 
its independence, its purity, and even its existence and action 
may be destroyed, or put into imminent danger. No other 
body, but itself, can have the same motives to preserve and 
perpetuate these attributes; no other body can be so 
perpetually watchful to guard its own rights and privileges 
from infringement, to purify and vindicate its own character, 
and to preserve the rights, and sustain the free choice of its 
constituents.407 
The House Judging Clause strongly suggests that the power to 
judge the elections, returns, and qualifications of electors is 
committed to the individual electoral colleges who compose their own 
"Houses," but we need not decide this in order to conclude that the 
power most emphatically does not belong to Congress.408 On Justice 
405. For additional discussion, see infra notes 582--89 and accompanying text.

408. Representative Randolph clearly made the point that each of the Electoral 
Colleges retained the power to judge the qualifications of electors in the Massachusetts 
Incident of 1809. See text accompanying supra note 96. The point was also suggested 
during the Postmaster Incident of 1837, which squarely presented the elector ineligibility 
problem of the electoral count. See supra notes 118-25 and accompanying text. Senator 
Grundy raised the issue thus: 
Should a case occur in which it became necessary to ascertain and determine 
upon the qualifications of electors of President and Vice-President of the United 
States, the important question would be presented, what tribunal would, under 
the Constitution, be competent to decide? Whether the respective colleges of 
electors in the different States should decide upon the qualifications of their own 
members, or Congress should exercise the power, is a question which the 
committee are of opinion ought to be settled by a permanent provision upon the 
subject.

might be deemed most expedient"). For the structural argument supporting the power of  VP-R0000181_0103 
(2021-079) 
1754 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 80 
Story's logic, the power, if vested in Congress, would risk the 
"independence" and "purity" of the electoral colleges, and "put 
[them] into imminent danger." Note too how the House Judging 
Clause eschews bicameralism, with each House of Congress acting 
independently of the other, only with respect to its own Members. 
The intratextual argument from the House Judging Clause 
enjoys a rich pedigree in the constitutional debates over Congress's 
ability to regulate the electoral count. As early as 1800, Senator 
Baldwin, a Framer at the Philadelphia Convention of 1787, made 
precisely this intratextual argument in his speech against the Grand 
Committee Bill. "[W]hat are the questions which can arise on the 
subject intrusted to [electors], to which they are incompetent, or to 
which Congress is so much more competent?," he asked.409 One set 
of questions were "[t]hose which relate to the elections, returns, and 
qualifications of their own members," and on this issue he concluded, 
"[S]hall these be taken away from that body [of electors], and 
submitted to the superior decision and control of Congress, without a 
particle of authority for it from the Constitution?"410 Senator 
Baldwin clearly invoked the language of the House Judging Clause to 
make the intratextual argument, for the phrase "elections, returns and 
qualifications" appears but once in the Constitution. 
During the electoral count of 1857, Senator Collamer expressed 
very serious constitutional doubts about whether the two Houses of 
Congress could by joint resolution express any opinion that the 
electoral votes of the State of Wisconsin were null and void because 
these votes had been given on a day different from that prescribed by 
law.411 He "very much doubt[ed] whether the [F]ramers of the 
Constitution ever intended to leave the subject of presidential 
election to the House of Representatives, or the Senate, or either, or 
both of them."412 Evidently pointing to the House Judging Clause, he 
stated, "The Constitution vested in each house the power to decide 
upon the election of its members; it provided carefully that it would 
not trust to the two houses to elect a President."413 
In May of 1874, the House Committee on Privileges and 
Elections employed the intratextual argument in a lengthy report 
each Electoral College "House" to judge the qualifications of Electors, see infra notes 
479-97 and accompanying text.

supporting a proposed amendment to the Constitution. The 
proposed amendment provided for the abolition of the Electoral 
College mode of presidential election in favor of direct, popular 
election and empowered Congress "to provide for holding and 
conducting elections of President and Vice-President, and to establish 
tribunals for the decision of such elections as may be contested."414 In 
a section of the report captioned "Congress is not a Canvassing 
Board," the report provided in relevant part: 
The proposition that Congress has power to sit as a 
canvassing board upon the electoral votes of the States, 
admitting or rejecting them for reasons of its own, subverts 
the whole theory by which their appointment was conferred 
upon the States; makes Congress the judge of the election and 
qualifications of President and Vice-President, and, by the 
operation of the twenty-second joint rule, gives that power 
to each house separately, as in case of its own members. 
There is no such express power given to Congress in the 
Constitution, nor is it necessary to carry out any express 
power therein given, and its exercise would be in direct 
conflict with the known purpose of the [F]ramers to make 
the executive and legislative departments as nearly 
independent of each other as possible.415 
The intratextual argument from the House Judging Clause did 
not lose any vigor in the Electoral Count Act debates. Senator 
Burnside put the intratextual point bluntly, stating that 
it was never the intention of the [F]ramers of the 
Constitution to make Congress the judge of the 
qualifications of the electors. If it had been so, the 
Constitution would have distinctly stated it. It makes each 
house the judge of the qualifications of its own members in 
express terms, but it does not imply even that Congress has 
any right to judge of the qualifications of the electors.416 
So too Senator Edmunds made the intratextual argument, but a 
considerably more complex one. He pointed to the Vesting Clause of 
Article III417 and three clauses of Article I-the House Judging 
Clause, the House Expulsion Clause,418 and the Senate Impeachment

of Congress, and concluded that "no judicial power is invested in 
either or both Houses of Congress that is not especially named and 
imputed to them as such and in such terms. "420 
Importantly, as the foregoing statements suggest, the intra textual 
argument is not just a narrow textual point from negative implication. 
The intratextual argument gains its strength from the context of its 
application. The House Judging Clause merely makes explicit an 
implicit idea that a body has judicial power over the privileges of its 
own members.421 The important question for present purposes is 
whether Congress has judicial power over the privileges of non­
member electors, especially in light of the "known purpose of the 
[F]ramers to make the executive and legislative departments as nearly 
independent of each other as possible. "422 
In sum, the intratextual argument from the House Judging 
Clause strongly suggests that Congress has no judicial power over the 
elections, returns, and qualifications of electors. 
* * * 
The intratextual arguments from both the Times, Places, and 
Manner Clause and the House Judging Clause are textual arguments 
from negative implication. These two clauses carefully empower 
Congress and each House of Congress, respectively, in congressional 
elections, and the Electoral College Clauses contain no analogues 
concerning presidential election. As a brute textual matter, the 
intratextual argument raises doubt as to Congress's ability to regulate 
the manner of presidential election and to judge the elections, 
returns, and qualifications of electors.

Of course, textual arguments from negative implication need to 
be applied sensitively and contextually in order to avoid wooden 
readings of the Constitution.423 A sensitive and contextual 
interpretation of the intratextual argument reveals a strong case 
against Congress's ability to regulate the manner of presidential 
election and to judge the elections, returns, and qualifications of 
electors. As a matter of sensitive interpretation, the intratextual 
arguments from negative implication deserve special weight given the 
prolixity of the Electoral College Clauses, relative to other clauses of 
Article II which mark the grand contours of executive power, and 
more importantly, relative to the clauses of Article I which empower 
Congress in congressional elections. It hardly seems that the Framers 
simply forgot to draft clauses in Article II analogous to the Times, 
Places, and Manner Clause or the House Judging Clause, or 
understood Article II impliedly to contain such congressional power 
over presidential election. 
As a matter of contextual interpretation, we should be especially 
chary of Congress's role in presidential election. The intratextual 
argument deserves special weight in light of the structural features of 
presidential election, namely the repudiation of Congress in the 
process of presidential election.424 As we shall see, the Framers 
instituted an electoral college mode of presidential election as a 
replacement for the election of the President by the Congress. The 
Elector Incompatibility Clause also expresses the anti-Congress 
principle in presidential election by prohibiting Members of Congress 
from even serving as electors.425 As Senator Wilson put the point, 
"When the [F]ramers of the Constitution expressly prohibited 
Senators and Representatives from appointment as electors, they 
clearly indicated their purpose to exclude them from all power in or 
over the matter of the election of a President by the electors 
appointed by the States."426

In sum, the intratextual argument, when interpreted sensitively 
and contextually, strongly militates against the constitutionality of the 
Electoral Count Act. 
4. Conclusions 
Taken together, the textual arguments-traditional and 
intratextual-expose the unconstitutionality of the Electoral Count 
Act. What may seem to be expedient is not necessarily what is 
constitutional. First and foremost, the textual argument makes clear 
that there is no source of power, express or implied, for Congress to 
pass the Electoral Count Act. A careful analysis of the Necessary and 
Proper Clause and the Electoral College Clauses reveals that neither 
clause supports Congress's power to enact the Electoral Count Act. 
In the absence of an implied grant of power to Congress to enact such 
a statute, the Electoral Count Act is unconstitutional. Anyone who 
wishes to argue that the Electoral Count Act is constitutional must 
grapple with the threshold question of whether and where Congress 
has the power under the Constitution to enact such a statute. Other 
textual arguments relate to specific provisions of the Electoral Count 
Act. The constitutionality of the "Presiding Officer Clause" of 3 
U.S.C. § 15 is in serious doubt given conflict-of-interest principles 
relating to the vice presidency. The constitutionality of 3 U.S.C. § 17 
is beyond all serious doubt. This provision, which limits ( or purports 
to limit) the proceedings in each House of Congress in debating 
objections to electoral votes, is patently unconstitutional. Other 
textual arguments are holistic, even quasi-structural. The nature of 
the counting function by the counting agent is more "thin" than 
"thick," relating more to the ascertainment and aggregation of 
electoral votes, than to the judging of electoral votes. The bicameral 
counting procedure of 3 U.S.C. §15 violates the unicameralism 
principle of the Electoral College Clauses. And the intratextual 
argument from the Times, Places, and Manner Clause and the House 
Judging Clause strongly militates against the constitutionality of the 
Electoral Count Act, at least to the extent that the counting agent is 
to judge electoral votes contained in authentic electoral certificates. 
These textual arguments must also be considered in light of great 
care that the Framers took to remove Congress as much as possible 
from the business of electing the President. The fact that Congress 
has thrice failed to pass constitutional amendments giving Congress 
"power to provide for holding and conducting the elections of 
President and Vice President and to establish tribunals for the  VP-R0000181_0108 
(2021-079) 
2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 1759 
decision of such elections as may be contested"427 is another clue that 
militates against the constitutionality of the Electoral Count Act. 
Moreover, these three attempts at constitutional amendment 
occurred in the 1880s, just a few years before Congress passed-with 
no enabling constitutional amendment-the Electoral Count Act in 
1887. 
B. The Structural Argument 
In addition to textual argument, the interpretivist resolution of 
the Electoral Count Act is based on a structural argument. The 
structural argument illuminates a number of important themes that 
emerge from the Constitution as a whole.428 In the present context, 
the structural argument provides some of the most satisfying 
arguments that the Electoral Count Act is unconstitutional. This 
section proceeds in three sub-sections. The first sub-section presents 
five principles of presidential election. The second sub-section 
presents two principles of rule-making and law-making. The final 
sub-section assesses the conclusions of the structural argument. 
1. Five Principles of Presidential Election 
a. The Anti-Senate Principle 
First and foremost, the Constitution mistrusts the Senate in the 
process of presidential election. This is the anti-Senate principle of 
presidential election. The Electoral Count Act is unconstitutional 
because the Senate has equal agency with the House of 
Representatives in counting electoral votes. As we have seen, in a 
single return case, the joint convention may not reject electoral votes 
without the concurrence of the Senate, and in a multiple return case, 
the joint convention may not accept electoral votes without the 
concurrence of the Senate.429 And as Representative Caldwell 
explained during the Electoral Count Act debates: 
The separate concurrent action of both Houses provided for 
in the bill preserves the constitutional identity, rights, and 
dignity of each. This concession of each House to the other 
of equal and concurrent power to decide on informalities and

generally CHARLES L. BLACK, JR., STRUCTURE AND RELATIONSHIP IN 
CONSTITUTIONAL LA w (1969). For a pithy modem discussion, see PHILIP BOBBITT, 
CONSTITUTIONAL FATE: THEORY OF THE CONSTITUTION 74-92 (1982).

1760 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 80 
illegalities appearing on the face of returns, upon objection 
of a Senator or Representative, is necessary to the 
determination of results.430 
Whatever may be said about the involvement of both Houses of 
Congress in the process of counting electoral votes, it is clear that the 
Senate as a separate and distinct body is to have no agency in electing 
the President. The Electoral College Clauses make clear that the 
Senate and the House of Representatives are not created equally in 
the process of presidential election. Under the original Constitution 
and the Twelfth Amendment, if the electors shall have failed to make 
a choice, the House of Representatives chooses the President, not the 
Senate. Under the Twelfth Amendment, if the electors shall have 
failed to make a choice, the Senate only chooses the Vice President.431 
The logic behind the anti-Senate principle of presidential 
election is incredibly clear once we consult the entire text of the 
Constitution and its legislative history. Under the Constitution, the 
Senate assumes, in addition to its equal share of the Article I 
legislative power, three distinct powers. First, the Senate has judicial 
power as a court of impeachment for the President, Vice President, 
and all civil Officers of the United States.432 Second, the Senate 
shares executive-legislative power with the President in the business 
of treaty-making.433 Third, the Senate shares executive power with 
the President in the business of appointing Officers of the United 
430. 18 CONG. REC. 31 {1886) (emphasis added). 
431. The Senate has exercised this function only once in our history. In the electoral 
count of 1837, the Senate elected Richard M. Johnson as Vice President. See supra note 
127 and accompanying text. Note that the Senate's role in choosing the Vice President 
was even more circumscribed under the original Constitution, further removing the Senate 
from the business of electing the nation's two top executive officers. Article II, Section 1, 
Clause 3 provided that 
[i]n every Case, after the Choice of the President [by the House of 
Representatives], the Person having the greatest Number of Votes of the 
Electors shall be the Vice President. But if there should remain two or more who 
have equal Votes, the Senate shall chuse from them by Ballot the Vice President. 
U.S. CONST. art. II, § 1, cl. 3. 
432. See U.S. CONST. art. I, § 3, cl. 6 ("The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all 
Impeachments."); see also THE FEDERALIST No. 66, at 370 (Alexander Hamilton) 
(Clinton Rossiter ed., Mentor 1999) (1961) (referring to the Senate as a "court of 
impeachments"). 
433. See U.S. CONST. art. II, § 2, cl. 2 ("[The President] shall have Power, by and with 
the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two[-]thirds of the 
Senators present concur."). To be sure, the founding generation seriously debated 
whether the treaty-making power was executive, legislative, or neither. For one view, see 
THE FEDERALIST No. 75, at 419 (Alexander Hamilton) (Clinton Rossiter ed., Mentor 
1999) (1961) ("The power in question seems therefore to form a distinct department, and 
to belong, properly, neither to the legislative nor to the executive.").  VP-R0000181_0110

2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 1761 
States.434 It is important to remember that the Committee of Eleven's 
Report of the Electoral College Clauses at the Philadelphia 
Convention provided that, if the electors failed to make a choice, the 
Senate would elect the President and the Vice President. The House 
of Representatives was to have no role whatsoever. The Report 
provided in relevant part: 
[A]nd they shall make a list of all the persons voted for, and 
of the number of votes for each, which list they shall sign 
and certify and transmit sealed to the Seat of the[] Genl. 
Government, directed to the President of the Senate-The 
President of the Senate shall in that House open all the 
certificates; and the votes shall be then & there counted. 
The Person having the greatest number of votes shall be the 
President, if such number be a majority of that of the 
electors; and if there be more than one who have such a 
majority, and have an equal number of votes, then the 
Senate shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for 
President: but if no person have a majority[,] then from the 
five highest on the list, the Senate shall choose by ballot the 
President. And in every case after the choice of the 
President, the person having the greatest number of votes 
shall be vice-president: but if there should remain two or 
more who have equal votes, the Senate shall choose from 
them the vice-president.435 
The Framers feared that the totality of these powers was simply 
too much. They feared that the Senate, already powerful, would 
become a dangerous aristocracy, and that the President, already 
dependent on the Senate in treaty-making and appointments, would 
be a mere creature of that body.436 Consequently, on September 6, 
434. U.S. CONST. art. II, § 2, cl. 2. 
435. 2 FARRAND, supra note 35, at 497-98 ( emphasis added). 
436. For a classic statement to this effect, see id. at 522 where James Wilson remarked: 
They will have in fact, the appointment of the President, and through his 
dependence on them, the virtual appointment to offices; among others the offices 
of the Judiciary Department. They are to make Treaties; and they are to try all 
impeachments. In allowing them thus to make the Executive & Judiciary 
appointments, to be the Court of impeachments, and to make Treaties which are 
to be laws of the land, the Legislative, Executive & Judiciary powers are all 
blended in one branch of the Government. ... [T]he President will not be the 
man of the people as he ought to be, but the Minion of the Senate. He cannot 
even appoint a tide-waiter ,vithout the Senate.

1787, on a motion by Roger Sherman, the Framers rejected the 
contingent election of the President and Vice President by the Senate, 
providing instead for the choice by the House of Representatives.437 
This change passed by a vote of ten to one.438 
In The Federalist No. 66, Alexander Hamilton explained the logic 
for this change in the context of the balance of powers between the 
House of Representatives and the Senate, carefully struck by the 
Constitution: 
[T]o secure the equilibrium of the national House of 
Representatives, the plan of the convention has provided in 
its favor several important counterpoises to the additional 
authorities to be conferred upon the Senate. The exclusive 
privilege of originating money bills will belong to the House 
of Representatives. The same house will possess the sole 
right of instituting impeachments; is not this a complete 
counterbalance to that of determining them? The same 
house will be the umpire in all elections of the President 
(suggesting that the contingent election should be made by Congress and not the Senate 
because "the House of Reps. will so often be changed as to be free from the influence & 
faction to which the permanence of the Senate may subject that branch"); id. at 511 
(remarks of Charles Pinckney) (objecting to Report because "the dispersion of the votes 
would leave the appointment with the Senate, and as the President's reappointment will 
thus depend on the Senate he will be the mere creature of that body"); id. (remarks of 
John Rutlidge) (objecting to Report because "[i]t would throw the whole power [of 
presidential election] into the Senate"); id. at 512 (remarks of George Mason) (objecting 
to Report because "[i]t puts the appointment in fact into the hands of the Senate" and that 
"[t]he great objection with him would be removed by depriving the Senate of the eventual 
election"); id. at 512 (remarks of Hugh Williamson) ("Referring the appointment to the 
Senate lays a certain foundation for corruption & aristocracy.'·); id. at 513 (remarks of 
Governor Randolph) ("He dwelt on the tendency of such an influence of the Senate over 
the election of the President in addition to its other powers, to convert that body into a 
real & dangerous Aristocracy"); id. (remarks of John Dickinson) ("[He] was in favor of 
giving the eventual election to the Legislature, instead of the Senate-It was too much 
influence to be superadded to that body"); id. at 515 (remarks of George Mason) {"As the 
mode of appointment is now regulated, he could not forebear expressing his opinion that 
it is utterly inadmissible. He would prefer the Government of Prussia to one which will 
put all power into the hands of seven or eight men, and fix an Aristocracy worse than 
absolute monarchy.''); id. at 522 (remarks of Elbridge Gerry) (proposing eventual election 
of President to be made by Congress and not Senate so as to "relieve the President from 
his particular dependence on the Senate for his continuance in office"); id. at 522 (remarks

which do not unite the suffrages of a majority of the whole 
number of electors; a case which it cannot be doubted will 
sometimes, if not frequently, happen. The constant 
possibility of the thing must be a fruitful source of influence 
to that body.439 1763 
As this passage demonstrates, it was simply beyond question at 
the founding that the Senate as a separate and distinct body would 
have any agency in the process of presidential election.440 St. George 
Tucker, in his canonical "American Blackstone," first published in the 
wake of the constitutional crisis of the presidential election of 1800, 
summarized the anti-Senate principle of presidential election thus: 
[The Senate's] exclusion from any participation in the 
election of a president, is certainly founded upon the wisest 
policy: being associated with him in the exercise of his most 
important powers, and being chosen for a much longer 
period than the representatives, the presumption of undue 
influence, where the contest might be between a president in 
office, and any other person, would be altogether 
unavoidable.441 
The anti-Senate principle of presidential election was not lost in 
the Electoral Count Act debates. Senator Bayard thought it 
dispositive in urging the repeal of the Twenty-second Joint Rule.442 "I 
do not think," said Bayard, "that anywhere in the Constitution can be 
found language in any degree constituting the Senate of the United 
States a factor or an actor in the election of the President of the 
United States."443 He asked, "But will any Senator show me any 
clause of the Constitution, any implication which can be argued from 
any clause of the Constitution, which gives the Senate one particle of 
lawful power in controlling the choice of a President or a Vice­
President of the United States?"444 Senator Whyte thought the anti­
Senate principle so strong an objection to the Electoral Count Act 
that he stated, "I would rather vote for a bill leaving it to the House 
of Representatives to interfere than a bill which provided that the

reprinted in 3 FARRAND, supra note 35, at 458 ("The Agency of the H. of Reps. was 
thought safer also than that of the Senate, on account of the greater number of its 
members.").

Senate should have anything to do with the election of President of 
the United States."445 
The Electoral Count Act, like the Twenty-second Joint Rule, 
violates the anti-Senate principle of presidential election. The 
involvement of the Senate as a separate and distinct body in the 
process of counting electoral votes runs seriously afoul of 
constitutional structure. The equal agency of the Senate with the 
House of Representatives in the Electoral Count Act impermissibly 
infringes upon the constitutional prerogatives of the House of 
Representatives in "umpir[ing]" presidential election, and 
consequently, unduly strengthens the powers of the Senate in 
presidential election. Moreover, the equal agency of the Senate 
violates the Framers' deliberate choice to exclude the Senate 
altogether from the process of presidential election. 
This is not to say that the anti-Senate principle of presidential 
election requires that Senators must not participate in counting 
electoral votes. There is a constitutionally significant difference 
between the Senate as a separate and distinct body, and Senators as 
members of a joint convention of Senators and Representatives, 
where Representatives greatly outnumber Senators. The counting 
function is committed to the joint convention and all questions of the 
electoral count must be resolved by it on a per capita basis, not by two 
separate and distinct legislative bodies. 
b. The Anti-Congress Principle 
Second, the Constitution mistrusts Congress in the process of 
presidential election. This is the anti-Congress principle of 
presidential election. The joint convention violates the anti-Congress 
principle to the extent that it rejects electoral votes contained in 
authentic electoral certificates as not "regularly given."446 Two parts 
of the Electoral College Clauses carefully reflect the anti-Congress 
principle of presidential election. 
First, the electoral college mode of presidential election itself is

parliamentary system for good reason: to create an independent and 
firm Executive.448 
The Electoral College Clauses further reflect the rejection of the 
parliamentary system. In the event the electors fail to make a choice, 
Congress does nothing in choosing the President or Vice President. 
In such a case, the House of Representatives chooses the President 
and the Senate chooses the Vice President.449 There is no possible 
instance in which the two Houses of Congress act concurrently in 
choosing the President or Vice President.450 Representative 
Randolph seized upon this point during the Missouri Incident: 
What was the theory of this Constitution? It is that this 
House, except upon a certain contingency, has nothing at all 
to do with the appointment of President and Vice-President 
of the United States. What was to be the practice of the 
Constitution, as now proposed? That an informal meeting 
of this and the other house is to usurp the initiative, the 
nominative power, with regard to the two first officers of the 
Government, in despite and contempt of their decision. Is 
there to be no limit to the power of Congress? no mound or 
barrier to stay their usurpation? Why were the electoral 
bodies established?451

all questions arising on the occasion.").

1766 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 80 
Indeed, if we look at the Constitution as a whole, we see that it is 
a clause-by-clause rejection of the parliamentary system.452 The clear 
constitutional baseline is that congressional election of the President 
is prohibited. The concurrence of the House of Representatives and 
the Senate required by the Electoral Count Act runs afoul of 
constitutional structure.453 The fact that Congress does not elect the 
President or Vice President, however, does not necessarily mean that 
Congress shall have no role in judging electoral votes. 
Second, the Elector Incompatibility Clause provides that "no 
Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or 
Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector."454 The 
Elector Incompatibility Clause is a substantial structural guarantee of 
independence from Members of Congress. The clause "is a provision 
which goes ... to show how extremely guarded the Constitution is in 
preventing the members of Congress from having any agency in the 
election, except merely in counting the votes."455 When Members of 
Congress are prohibited from even giving electoral votes, what gives 
them the constitutional authority to judge electoral votes? But again, 
the fact that Members of Congress are prohibited from even giving 
electoral votes does not necessarily mean that Members of Congress 
shall have no role in judging electoral votes. 
452. The single clause which best expresses this separation-of-powers vision is U.S. 
CONST. art. I, § 6, cl. 2 ("[N]o Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be 
a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office."). For a rich discussion of 
this clause's significance as a repudiation of the parliamentary system, see generally 
Steven G. Calabresi & Joan L. Larsen, One Person, One Office: Separation of Powers or 
Separation of Personnel?, 79 CORNELL L. REV. 1045 (1994). See also Amar & Amar, 
supra note 27, at 118-25 (providing additional discussion of separation-of-powers structure 
of Constitution). 
453. One corollary of this argument is that if there is no power for concurrent action 
then it follows a fortiori that there is no power for either House of Congress alone. For 
example, Senator Wilson remarked: 
[I]f no such power rests with the two Houses for concurrent action, how much 
more preposterous does it seem to be to claim that it rests with either House 
alone, and especially with the House of Representatives, ,vith which body to 
elect a President abides in the event of a failure of the electors to elect?

2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 1767 
The anti-Congress principle should bear on the overall 
interpretation of the Electoral Count Act. The anti-Congress 
principle stands for the thinnest conception of congressional 
regulation in counting electoral votes. As Senator Pinckney 
explained: 
How could [the Framers] expect, that in deciding on the 
election of a President, particularly where such election was 
strongly contested, that party spirit would not prevail, and 
govern every decision? Did they not know how easy it was 
to raise objections against the votes of particular elections, 
and that in determining upon these, it was more than 
probable, the members would recollect their sides, their 
favorite candidate, and sometimes their own interests? Or 
must they not have supposed, that, in putting the ultimate 
and final decision of the Electors in Congress, who were to 
decide irrevocably and without appeal, they would render 
the President their creature, and prevent his assuming and 
exercising that independence in the performance of his 
duties upon which the safety and honor of the Government 
must forever rest?456 
Simply put, the joint convention may not judge the acts of 
electors-that is, their electoral votes. 
c. The Anti-President Principle 
Third, the Constitution does not provide any role for the 
President in the process of presidential election. The Electoral Count 
Act, however, did involve the President. The Electoral Count Act is 
a law, not a rule of proceeding like the Twenty-second Joint Rule. 
Laws require bicameralism and presentment to the President, 
whereas rules (including joint rules) do not.457 The Electoral Count 
456. 10 ANNALS OF CONG. 130-31. Professor Harrison recently put the point in the 
context of old and recent history: 
As the experiences of 1876-1877 and 2000 indicate, giving Congress power to 
resolve an electoral dispute is very close to giving it power to choose the 
President; indeed, electoral disputes could be trumped up for that very purpose. 
It is unlikely that the Constitution allows through the back door what it bars the 
front door against.

1768 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 80 
Act was presented to and approved by President Cleveland. Is it not 
absurd to give the President an agency in counting the electoral votes 
of her successors? During the Wisconsin Incident of 1857, Senator 
Pugh objected to a mere joint resolution stating that Wisconsin's 
electoral votes should not have been counted because it would 
require presentment to the President. "Now, confessedly," said Pugh, 
"the President has nothing to do with counting the votes for his 
successor."458 Whether President Cleveland's approval of the 
Electoral Count Act presents an incurable constitutional problem of 
the past for the Electoral Count Act is beyond the scope of the 
present analysis. 
What is important for present purposes, however, is that a law 
cannot be repealed without presentment to and approval by the 
President, or by a two-thirds super-majority of both Houses of 
Congress. This is a constitutional problem for the Electoral Count 
Act because the President has a significant agency in the law of the 
status quo. During the Electoral Count Act debates, Senator Hager 
put this point best: 
But, as I said suppose this bill becomes a law signed by the 
President, how are you to get rid of it in the future? If it is 
binding upon the Senate and House that meet next it 
requires, in order to repeal it, not only the vote of the Senate 
and the House, but the approval of the President. Thus the 
President enters into the consideration, when the 
Constitution never contemplated any such thing. It is a duty 
imposed entirely upon the Senate and House of 
Representatives; and if you pass this bill in order that it may 
be a law it requires the approval of the President, and 
hereafter to repeal it and get rid of it also requires the 
approval of the President, so that a future Senate and a 
future House of Representatives may be entirely under the 
control of the President of the United States. . . . Did the 
[F]ramers of the Constitution contemplate any such state of 
things as that when the twelfth article of amendment was 
adopted? It was the intent that the people should control 
the election of the President, and not the President of the 
United States. . . . The President has nothing to do with it.459

2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 1769 
To be sure, the President has an agency in presidential succession 
under the Presidential Succession Clause,460 but the President is 
behind a veil of ignorance when it comes to presidential succession­
unlike presidential election. 
d. The Pro-States and Pro-State Legislatures Principle 
Fourth, the Constitution trusts the states and state legislatures in 
the process of presidential election. This is the pro-states and pro­
state legislatures principle of presidential election. This principle 
makes clear that Congress has no role over some of the problems of 
the electoral count. 
Let us once again tum to Senator Pinckney's famous speech 
against the Grand Committee Bill. Invoking the Tenth Amendment, 
Senator Pinckney argued that the Grand Committee Bill trampled on 
the rights of the states: he considered the right of the states to be free 
from congressional interference in the election of the President as 
sacred as the right of the states to be free from congressional 
interference in matters of religion and the press.461 Senator Pinckney 
then observed: 
This right of determining on the manner in which the 
Electors shall vote; the inquiry into the qualifications, and 
the guards necessary to prevent disqualified or improper 
men voting, and to insure the votes being legally given, rests 
and is exclusively vested in the State Legislatures. If it is 
necessary to have guards against improper elections of 
Electors, and to institute tribunals to inquire into their 
qualifications, with the State Legislatures, and with them 
alone, rests the power to institute them, and they must 
exercise it.462

on Privileges and Elections in 1874 similarly reported:

1770 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 80 
It will thus be seen that the mode of choosing the electors is 
placed entirely beyond the power and jurisdiction of the 
National Government; and whatever disorders, 
irregularities, or failures in the appointment of electors may 
occur in any of the States, they are entirely without remedy 
or redress upon the part of the Government of the United 
States.463 
How did Senator Pinckney and the House Committee on 
Privileges and Elections reach this conclusion? The italicized words 
ought to provide a strong clue. Senator Pinckney expressly invoked 
the Times, Places, and Manner Clause in his argument against the 
Grand Committee Bill,464 and the use of the word "mode" by the 
House Committee on Privileges and Elections is merely a synonym 
for the word "Manner" in the Times, Places, and Manner Clause. 
As we saw earlier, the intratextual implications of the Times, 
Places, and Manner Clause are potentially powerful. In sum, with 
respect to presidential election, the Constitution fixes the "Place" 
(with the electors meeting in their respective states), empowers 
Congress to fix the "Time," and empowers the state legislatures to 
determine the "Manner." Unlike Article I, the state legislatures have 
the final word on that important subject; Congress has no power to 
determine on the "Manner" of presidential election. 
But what is the breadth of power textually committed to state 
legislatures in presidential election? Does the word "Manner" in the 
Times, Places, and Manner Clause include the power to investigate 
the qualifications of electors? To determine an answer to this 
question, let us begin by looking to The Federalist No. 59 in which 
Alexander Hamilton brilliantly defends the Times, Places, and 
Manner Clause, which was the subject of much criticism by both 
Federalists and Anti-Federalists alike. Hamilton correctly notes "that 
there were only three ways in which this power could have been 
reasonably modified and disposed: that it must either have been 
lodged wholly in the national legislature, or wholly in the State 
legislatures, or primarily in the latter and ultimately in the former."465 
Consider Alexander Hamilton's justifications for reposing ultimate 
power over congressional elections in Congress: 
If the State legislatures were to be invested with an exclusive 
power of regulating these [House of Representatives] 
elections, every period of making them would be a delicate

cns1s in the national situation, which might issue in a 
dissolution of the Union, if the leaders of a few of the most 
important States should have entered into a previous 
conspiracy to prevent an election.466 1771 
Two points should become immediately apparent. First, as the 
italicized word indicates, Alexander Hamilton read the "Manner" in 
the Times, Places, and Manner Clause as a type of regulation by the 
state legislatures. This ought to come as no surprise given the text of 
that clause which provides that "Congress may at any time by Law 
make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing 
Senators. "467 
Second, what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. 
Hamilton's defense of the Times, Places, and Manner Clause is no 
less applicable to presidential election. When we consult the 
Electoral College Clauses, we see textually that the "Manner" of 
appointing electors is vested wholly in the state legislatures; it is not 
vested primarily in the state legislatures and ultimately in the 
Congress. If Congress had a role in regulating presidential election, 
Hamilton likely would have said so in The Federalist No. 68. 
What does all of this mean for questions of the electoral count? 
As Senator Pinckney and the House Committee on Privileges and 
Elections in 1874 noted, state legislatures might have jurisdiction 
(perhaps exclusive jurisdiction) to decide on questions with respect to 
the validity of an elector's appointment.468 Dean Wroth adopts this 
view. He has written that "[t]he plain implication of the original 
scheme is that the states in their control of the manner of 
appointment were to provide for the settlement of whatever 
controversies might arise. . . . Local authorities would naturally 
resolve any contest."469 
The problem with this view is that it reads into the Times, Places, 
and Manner Clause some judicial power to look into the 
qualifications of an office holder. This would analogously imply that 
Congress has the judicial power to look into qualifications of 
466. Id. at365 (emphasis added). 
467. U.S. CONST. art. I,§ 4, cl.1 (emphasis added). 
468. Senator Pinckney had a much broader conception of the judicial power of State 
Legislatures, including the power "to insure the votes being legally given." See text 
accompanying supra note 462. However, it is especially hard to see how state legislatures 
have any jurisdiction over questions with respect to an elector's vote (whether, for 
example, that vote is constitutional or not). The "Manner" power of state legislatures is 
textually limited to the appointment of electors. Moreover, electors, once selected, are 
arguably independent of state legislatures. 
469. Wroth, supra note 22, at 324.  VP-R0000181_0121

1772 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 80 
Members of Congress because Congress has the ultimate control over 
the "Manner" of congressional election. The problem with this view 
is that such a power of Congress stands in seemingly direct violation 
of the power vested in each House of Congress to judge the 
qualifications of its members under the House Judging Clause.470 
It is also difficult to see how state legislatures ( and their 
tribunals) would have exclusive jurisdiction to settle whatever 
controversies might arise in the appointment of electors; the proper 
appointment of electors is very clearly a federal question which may 
be adjudicated by federal courts. 
The most important problem, however, is a temporal one. Given 
the immediacy principle of the Electoral College Clauses,471 there is 
simply no time to investigate-by the state legislatures and their 
tribunals or by federal courts--the validity of an elector's 
appointment once the electoral votes are being counted. Indeed, the 
better reading of the Electoral College Clauses may be that federal 
courts are vested with the judicial power to inquire into the proper 
appointment of electors between the "time of chusing the Electors" 
and "the Day on which they shall give their Votes." The problem 
here is that Members of Congress are not supposed to know who the 
electors in each state are in advance of the meeting of the electoral 
colleges, so that the electors may be as free and detached as possible. 
Moreover, Congress could easily make the time of choosing the 
electors the same day on which the electors shall give their votes,472 
leaving no time for the judicial investigation of electors' 
appointments. 
Finally, in addition to the argument made by Senator Pinckney 
and the House Committee on Privileges and Elections in 187 4, there 
is a broader argument that Congress should have no role in regulating 
presidential election. In reviewing Hamilton's justification for the 
Times, Places, and Manner Clause, we see that there could be no 
analogous "delicate crisis in the national situation"473 if the state 
legislatures had the last word on determining "Manner." This is 
because our Constitution ensures that we will never be without a 
President. 
One view is that the Electoral College Clauses were carefully 
crafted to provide for the election of a President should the states fail

2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 1773 
in performing their constitutional duties. For example, Dean Wroth 
has written: 
The method for electing a President may be contrasted with 
the provisions for congressional elections. In the latter 
instance, as Hamilton pointed out in the Federalist, Congress 
must have ultimate control over the manner of election of its 
own members, lest the states, by refusing to elect 
Congressmen, cause the whole structure to fall. In the case 
of the presidency, since the House was ready to carry out the 
election if the states failed, congressional control was not 
only undesirable but unnecessary.474 
Dean Wroth is clearly alluding to the provision of the Electoral 
College Clauses which empowers the House of Representatives to 
choose the President in case of electoral deadlock. While Dean 
Wroth is correct in his intuition that we will not be without a 
President, he is incorrect as a matter of text. The choice of President 
by the House of Representatives is not unconstrained, but is limited­
to five persons by the original Constitution and now three persons by 
the Twelfth Amendment. If no states appoint electors and hence no 
electors vote, the House of Representatives could not elect a 
President (nor the Senate a Vice President). 
In the case posited by Dean Wroth, however, it may be that 
under the original Constitution, the Presidential Succession Clause of 
Article II would kick in to ensure that we are not without a 
President.475 This was the view of "Horatius" in a letter to the 
Washington Federalist on January 6, 1801-just five weeks before the 
troublesome election of then Vice-President Thomas Jefferson by the 
House of Representatives. In Horatius's view, the case of no election 
of President and Vice President by the electors fit squarely within the 
"removal" provision of the Presidential Succession Clause: 
The words used here [in the Presidential Succession Clause] 
are comprehensive enough to embrace every vacancy, and if 
they are construed not to embrace the case of removal by 
virtue of the constitutional terms of the offices of President 
and Vice-President, they will not embrace the vacancy most 
probable to happen, while they are admitted to embrace 
vacancies that are very improbable.476

1774 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 80 
We need not overly concern ourselves with the scope of 
"removal" in the Presidential Succession Clause because the 
Twentieth Amendment removes any ambiguity.477 A critic would 
argue that this reading of the Presidential Succession Clause does not 
remove Congress from the business of electing the President when 
the states fail to fulfill their constitutional duties. Indeed, the 
Presidential Succession Clause explicitly invites Congress to legislate 
on the subject of presidential succession. However, under that clause, 
Congress specifies who shall act as President until a special, 
intervening presidential election, and not who is President as under 
the Electoral College Clauses. Moreover, prospective legislation 
under the Presidential Succession Clause-enacted behind a veil of 
ignorance well before any constitutional crisis-provides a much 
more legitimate solution than allowing the House of Representatives 
to choose the President based on the circumstances at hand, when 
party spirit is likely to govern the choice. 
e. The Pro-Electors Principle 
Fifth, the Constitution trusts electors in the process of 
presidential election. More precisely, the Constitution trusts electors 
with the last word on the persons receiving votes-period. This is the 
pro-electors principle of presidential election. The Electoral Count 
Act is unconstitutional to the extent that the joint convention may 
reject electoral votes in authentic electoral certificates as not 
"regularly given."478 In other words, the joint convention may not 
examine the contents of electoral certificates and reject electoral 
votes because of the persons receiving votes. 
As a structural matter, the electoral colleges constitute a separate 
and coordinate branch of the Government of the United States479 
( although as an "architextural" matter,480 the electoral colleges 
occupy textual space in Article II along ,vith the executive branch of 
the Government of the United States). What gives Congress or the 
joint convention the authority to judge electoral votes?

The electoral colleges are inferior neither to Congress nor to the 
joint convention. The numbers suggest as much: the number of 
electors is equal to the number of Senators and Representatives.481 
As a separate and coordinate branch of government, the electors 
should have interpretive authority of the Constitution with respect to 
the powers committed to them.482 The founding generation 
understood that electors would be among the most virtuous citizens

483. For example, John Jay argued: 
As the select assemblies for choosing the President, as well as the State 
legislatures who appoint the senators, will in general be composed of the most 
enlightened and respectable citizens, there is reason to presume that their 
attention and their votes will be directed to those men only who have become the 
most distinguished by their abilities and virtue, and in whom the people perceive 
just grounds for confidence. . . . If the observation be well founded that wise 
kings will always be served by able ministers it is fair to argue that as an assembly 
of select electors possess, in a greater degree than kings, the means of extensive 
and accurate information relative to men and characters, so will their 
appointments bear at least equal marks of discretion and discernment.

change in the first decade after the founding. See, e.g., STANWOOD, supra note 7, at 51.

desirable that the immediate election should be made by men most capable of analyzing

deliberation, and to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which 
were proper to govern their choice.") ( emphasis added). Hamilton further argued: 
[A]s the electors, chosen in each State, are to assemble and vote in the State in 
which they are chosen, this detached and divided situation will expose them 
much less to heats and ferments, which might be communicated from them to the 
people, than if they were all to be convened at one time, in one place.

enjoy the same privileges and immunities as Members of Congress, 
including immunity from arrest and freedom of speech and debate.485 
Importantly, the electors also enjoy considerable structural 
independence from Congress. Electors receive no compensation 
from Congress for their federal service, nor has any Congress, to my 
knowledge, ever compensated electors for such service.486 Electors 
are also not subject to impeachment by the House of Representative 
or conviction by the Senate because they are not "civil Officers of the 
United States."487 
The structural coordinacy of electors and their structural 
independence is destroyed if Members of Congress may second-guess 
the electors' judgments. Unlike inferior courts whose decisions may 
be judged by the Supreme Court,488 the electors are not inferior to the 
joint convention of Senators and Representatives and may not be 
judged by them. As Representative Randolph put the point in 1821, 
"[T]he electoral college was as independent of Congress as Congress 
of them; and we have no right, said he, to judge of their 
proceedings."489 
A simple counterfactual underscores the structural principles of 
coordinacy and independence. Imagine that the Framers gave 
Members of Congress, instead of electors, the choice of electing the 
President and Vice President. Would there be any question that 
Members of Congress would have the last word on the persons voted 
for in the presidential and vice presidential election? Would the 
Chief Justice of the United States refuse to administer the 
presidential oath or affirmation if the Members of Congress acted 
unconstitutionally? Would that matter?

Speech of Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place."). For 
a claim that the President enjoys similar privileges although the Constitution does not so 
textually specify, see Amar & Katyal, supra note 423, at 702-08.

required this: as it was a national service they were to render. The motion was agreed to

(2021-079) 
2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 1777 
There is considerable historical support for the pro-electors 
principle of presidential election. Senator Baldwin, in bis remarks 
against the Grand Committee Bill in January of 1800, succinctly 
observed 
that the Constitution in directing Electors to be appointed 
throughout the United States equal to the whole number of 
the Senators and Representatives in Congress, for the 
express purpose of entrusting this Constitutional branch of 
power to them, had provided for the existence of as 
respectable a body as Congress, and in whom the 
Constitution on this business has more confidence than in 
Congress.490 
Senator Baldwin's statement highlights two important points: in 
absolute terms, the Constitution trusts electors, and in relative terms, 
the Constitution trusts electors more than Members of Congress. 
Senator Baldwin then posed a powerful counterfactual: What if 
the Constitution had provided that the electors meet at some central 
location instead of meeting in their respective states?491 The answer 
was obvious-the electors, not some other body, would resolve the 
problems of the electoral count.492 It therefore followed, according to 
Senator Baldwin, that the joint convention of Senators and 
Representatives had no additional power to judge electoral votes just 
because the electors meet in their respective states and not at some 
central location. He stated, "It having been deemed more safe by the 
Constitution to form them into different Electoral colleges, to be 
assembled in the several States, does not at all alter the nature or 
distinctness of their powers, or subject them any more to the control 
of the other departments of the Government."493 In his closing 
remarks, he observed that:

491. The Framers considered and rejected this idea. See 2 FARRAND, supra note 35, at 
525; id. at 526 ("Mr. Spaight said if the election by Electors is to be crammed down, he 
would prefer their meeting altogether and deciding finally without any reference to the 
Senate and moved 'That the Electors meet at the seat of the General Government.' "). 
This motion failed with all States in the negative except North Carolina. Id. Senator 
Baldwin, a Framer, no doubt remembered this history. 
492. Senator Baldwin argued: 
If this body of the Electors of all the States had been directed by the Constitution 
to assemble in one place, instead of being formed into different Electoral 
colleges, he took it for granted none of the questions on which this [Senator 
Ross's] resolution has been brought forward, would have occurred; every one 
would have acknowledged that they were to be settled in that assembly.

1778 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 80 
[ A ]11 the questions which had been suggested were as safely 
left to the decision of the assemblies of Electors as of any 
body of men that could be devised; and that the members of 
the Senate and House of Representatives, when met 
together in one room, should receive the act of the Electors 
as they would the act of any other Constitutional branch of 
the Government, to judge only of its authentication, and 
then to proceed to count the votes, as directed in the second 
article of the Constitution.494 
This statement underscores the critical distinction in the 
problems of the electoral count. The joint convention of Senators 
and Representatives should "judge only of [the] authentication" of 
the acts of electors (that is, their electoral certificates), but not judge 
the acts of electors (that is, their electoral votes).495 
Senator Pinckney, in his lengthy speech against the Grand 
Committee Bill in March of 1800, elaborated on the pro-electors 
principle of presidential election in the specific context of the 
presidential ineligibility problem of the electoral count-that is, the 
elector who votes for a President who is not constitutionally qualified. 
He believed that virtuous electors simply would not vote for a 
President of doubtful constitutional qualifications given the "immense 
power" of the President.496 If they did, however, he had a forcible 
answer: 
It is true they, as well as any other Constitutional branch of this 
Government acting under that instrument, may be guilty of 
taking unconstitutional or corrupt steps, but they do it at their 
peril. Suppose either of the other branches of the Government, 
the Executive, or the Judiciary, or even Congress, should be 
guilty of taking steps which are unconstitutional, to whom is it 
submitted, or who has control over it, except by impeachment? 
The Constitution seems to have equal confidence in all the 
branches on their own proper ground, and for either to arrogate 
superiority, or a claim to greater confidence, shows them in 
494. Id. at 32. 
495. This critical distinction in the problems of the electoral count is explained in Part 
III.A infra. 
496. Senator Pinckney argued: 
Who, when he reflects on the immense power the President possesses, can 
suppose that any man, honorably selected by his fellow-citizens as an Elector, 
could for a moment be so lost to a sense of his own and his country's welfare, as 
to vote for a man as the Supreme Executive, whose citizenship or residence were 
doubtful, and who were not of sufficient age?

particular to be unworthy of it, as it is in itself directly 
unconstitutional. 491 
In sum, in the process of presidential election, the Constitution 
trusts electors with the last word on the persons receiving votes. The 
joint convention does not sit in judgment of the acts of electors-that 
is, their electoral votes. At a minimum, the point is a relative one: 
the Constitution trusts electors more than Members of Congress. It is 
thus unconstitutional for the joint convention to reject electoral votes 
contained in authentic electoral certificates-even when those 
electoral votes are unconstitutional. 
2. Principles of Rule-Making and Law-Making 
The Electoral Count Act violates two critical structural principles 
of our Constitution: the anti-binding principle of rule-making and the 
Chadha principle of law-making. These structural arguments create a 
rather compelling case that the Electoral Count Act is 
unconstitutional. 
a. The Anti-Binding Principle of Rule-Making 
The anti-binding principle of rule-making prevents one Congress 
from binding another with respect to the rules of proceedings.498 
Moreover, one Congress cannot bind each House of Congress in a 
current Congress (let alone that of future Congresses) with respect to 
the rules of proceedings. Article I, Section 5, Clause 2 expressly 
reflects this principle by providing that "[e]ach House may determine 
497. Id. at 31 ( emphasis added). 
498. For a brilliant article on this general (and generally neglected) subject, see Paul 
W. Kahn, Gramm-Rudman and the Capacity of Congress to Control the Future, 13 
HASTINGS CONST. L.Q. 185 (1986). A starting point is Blackstone's maxim: "Acts of 
Parliament derogatory from the power of subsequent Parliaments bind not." 1 WILLIAM 
BLACKSTONE, COMMENTARIES *90. For an extensive collection of British sources on this 
point, see Brett W. King, Deconstructing Gordon and Contingent Legislative Authority: 
The Constitutionality of Supermajority Rules, 6 U. Cm. L. SCH. ROUNDTABLE 133, 188 
n.248 (1999). 
Professor Kahn's argument is that there are two types of statutes: "first-order 
rules" and "second-order rules." The former type addresses behavior directly, and 
includes most laws; the latter type addresses other rules, imposing burdens on 
constitutionally assigned functions (for example, legislation), and necessarily raises 
questions as to what Congress may accomplish by statute versus by constitutional 
amendment. According to Kahn, the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control 
Act of 1985, popularly known as Gramm-Rudman, is a second-order rule, and therefore 
raises interesting and significant constitutional problems. He further argues that a future 
Congress's freedom to repeal a second-order rule does not cure the constitutional 
infirmities of such legislation. See Kahn, supra, at 190-204.  VP-R0000181_0129 
(2021-079) 
1780 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 80 
the Rules of its Proceedings."499 Indeed, as a formal matter, the rules 
of proceedings in the House of Representatives expire at the end of 
the term of each House and are re-enacted by the next House.500 (In 
contrast, the rules of proceedings in the Senate do not expire because 
the Senate is a continuing body.501) 
The Electoral Count Act clearly violates the anti-binding 
principle of rule-making. The Electoral Count Act is a law of 
proceeding for the electoral count, not a rule of proceeding like the 
Twenty-second Joint Rule.502 As such, the Electoral Count Act 
499. U.S. CONST. art. I, § 5, cl. 2. Professor Kahn usefully relates that "the House [of 
Representatives] has taken the position that it is free to abandon statutory provisions that 
purport to regulate internal House procedures." Kahn, supra note 498, at 226. He 
discusses an early precedent within the first decade after the founding concerning a subject 
relevant to the one at hand: determining the outcome of disputed congressional elections. 
He observes: 
When Congress passed in 1797 a statute designed to regulate disputed elections, 
members in the House objected to the statute as an infringement on each house's 
rules powers. The statute was defended as legitimate because it did not prescribe 
rules for the House but rather procedures binding on the general public, outside 
of Congress. The House later adopted the position that no power 
constitutionally committed to one House by the Constitution could be abridged 
by an earlier statute.

SENATE, s. Doc. No. 102-25, at 4 (1992)). 
502. There should be no question that the Electoral Count Act is a law that regulates a 
particular proceeding. To be sure, Members of Congress identified it as a "permanent 
rule" or "fixed rule" during the Electoral Count Act debates. See, e.g., COUNTING 
ELECTORAL VOTES, supra note 3, at 520 (1876) (remarks of Sen. Bayard) (referring to 
"framing of such a permanent rule in the shape of law upon this subject as would be 
satisfactory to the American people"); id. at 523 (remarks of Sen. Bayard) ("[F]or this is 
not a law for to-day only; it is to become a settled law, a fixed rule, requiring for its repeal 
the assent of a majority of each house and the President of the United States."); 18 CONG. 
REC. 30 (1886) (remarks of Rep. Caldwell) {"This bill is to prescribe the mode in which 
this count shall be made .... "); id. at 49 (1886) (remarks of Rep. Eden) ("The object of 
the bill of the Senate is to fix certain rules by which the two Houses shall be governed in 
counting the electoral vote."); id. at 50 (similar). Not surprisingly, some Members of 
Congress put the terms "law" or "joint rule" on the same constitutional plane in discussing 
the counting of electoral votes. See, e.g., 17 CONG. REC. 815 (1886) (remarks of Sen. 
Sherman) (noting that "this most important duty of counting the electoral vote ... is now 
without law or rule to govern the mode and manner of its procedure"); 18 CONG. REC. 30  VP-R0000181_0130 
(2021-079) 
2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 1781 
imperm.issibly binds the actions of future joint conventions. During 
the Electoral Count Act debates, Members of Congress naturally 
recognized that the Electoral Count Act would be used to bind the 
actions of future joint conventions by settling questions of counting 
electoral votes in advance.503 Indeed, in describing Congress's 
motivation in passing the Electoral Count Act, Professors Issacharoff, 
Karlan, and Pildes state that "Congress needed a binding rule, 
because the previous approach of counting electoral votes under a 
joint procedural rule that could be revoked by either house had led to 
the rule being revoked whenever one house disapproved of the 
results it would produce."504 
Two sections of the Electoral Count Act-3 U.S.C. §§ 5 and 15-
imperm.issibly bind ( or purport to bind) the joint convention in 
counting electoral votes. The former section, the one at issue in Bush 
v. Gore, provides: 
If any State shall have provided, by laws enacted prior to the 
day fixed for the appointment of the electors, for its final 
determination of any controversy or contest concerning the 
appointment of all or any of the electors of such State, by 
judicial or other methods or procedures, and such 
determination shall have been made at least six days before 
the time fixed for the meeting of the electors, such 
determination made pursuant to such law so existing on said 
day, and made at least six days prior to said time of meeting 
of the electors, shall be conclusive, and shall govern in the 
counting of the electoral votes as provided in the Constitution, 
and as hereinafter regulated, so far as the ascertainment of 
the electors appointed by such State is concemed.505 
The latter section, as we have seen, binds the joint conventions 
with an intricate set of rules for counting electoral votes.506 This 
(1886) (remarks of Rep. Caldwell) ("Congress may provide by law or joint rule the 
manner of counting the [electoral] vote."); id. at 46 (1886) (remarks of Rep. Dibble) ("[I]t 
is competent for Congress, by statute or by joint agreement, joint resolution, or joint rule, 
to name individuals to exercise the duty of making the [electoral] count."). 
503. See, e.g., 18 CONG. REC. 30 (remarks of Rep. Caldwell) ("[T]his bill if passed will 
be an authoritative expression of the Constitution erected into law in advance of any 
complication which may again arise, as it has in the past, as to the counting the electoral 
votes of the States and the declaration of the result."); id. ("The passage of this bill will 
settle all the questions which have arisen from time to time as to the electoral count."). 
504. ISSACHAROFF ET AL., supra note 18, at 97 (emphasis added). For expressions of 
this concern during the Electoral Count Act debates, see 17 CONG. REC. 815 (remarks of

section binds the joint conventions with even the most minor of rules, 
including a rule that "certificates and papers shall be opened, 
presented, and acted upon in the alphabetical order of the States, 
beginning with the letter A."507 Thus, unless the Electoral Count Act 
is repealed or amended, future joint conventions could not proceed 
with counting electoral votes in reverse alphabetical order of states in 
the Union without acting illegally. 
Two constitutional problems should be apparent. First, Congress 
might not have the authority to determine the rules of proceedings for 
its joint convention. The joint convention is decidedly not Congress, 
but a distinct parliamentary body with constitutionally-assigned 
functions.508 Indeed, under our Constitution, Congress may not even 
determine the rules of proceedings of the House of Representatives 
or the Senate.509 It would seem to follow that the joint convention has 
the constitutional prerogative to determine the rules of its 
proceedings when it meets once every four years. Second, even if 
Congress may bind its joint convention, Congress may not bind the 
joint convention of future Congresses in the exercise of 
constitutionally-assigned functions. 
The anti-binding principle of rule-making should be a conclusive 
structural argument that the Electoral Count Act is unconstitutional. 
It is a formalist argument, however, and undoubtedly will be criticized 
as such. 
Consider the writings of one of our leading constitutional 
scholars on the very question of the anti-binding principle, and in the 
very context of counting electoral votes. Professor Amar, in an essay 
on presidential succession originally prepared and submitted as 
testimony before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the 
Constitution on February 2, 1994, recommended that "Congress 
should provide by statute that an electoral vote for any person who is 
dead at the time of the congressional counting is a valid vote, and will 
be counted, so long as the death occurred on or after Election Day."510 
Recall the Greeley incident of 1872511-the specific case that 
507. 3 u.s.c. § 15. 
508. Even if one believes that the counting function is committed to Congress and not 
to the joint convention, it is not at all clear that one Congress may bind itself in advance 
with respect to rules of proceedings of the electoral count. For a thoughtful discussion of 
one Congress binding itself with respect to rules of proceedings of legislation, see John 0.

2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 1783 
Professor Amar sought to remedy by statute.512 To be sure, Professor 
Amar defended his proposal against the formalist argument of the 
anti-binding principle of rule-making: 
Spoilsports might argue that, strictly speaking, any 
legislation passed today could not conclusively bind a future 
result-oriented Congress, which would be free to replace the 
earlier law after [President-elect] Smith's death but before 
the official vote counting in Congress. ( One Congress cannot 
generally bind a successor Congress.) And worrywarts might 
fret over whether our proposed legislation should be enacted 
as a law rather than a joint or concurrent resolution, since it 
seeks to regulate how votes will be counted in Congress itself 
(Sections 15 through 18 of Title 3, however, do provide a 
clear precedent for regulating congressional vote-counting 
by law.) 
The spoilsports and worrywarts largely miss the point. 
The key function of our proposed legislation is to serve as a 
precommitment and focal point. With our proposed 
legislation on the books, it will be much more difficult, 
politically, for a future result-oriented Congress to change 
the rules and discount the votes for Smith. The principled 
precedent will be our legislation, not the Greeley affair. 
Citizens, pundits, reporters, and politicians will be able to 
point to the plain language, in black and white, in the United 
States Code, answering the question of the hour. Any 
deviation from this clear focal point will obviously smack of 
changing the rules in the middle of the game-indeed, after 
the game has ended.513 
Call me a worrywart, but not a spoilsport. Indeed, if we are to 
"take text and structure seriously" and not follow "free-form" 
methods of constitutional interpretation,514 call me a worrywart again. 
Professor Amar's statement leaves little doubt that the Electoral 
Count Act is formally unconstitutional. But does worrywart 
formalism make the Electoral Count Act any less unconstitutional?

1784 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 80 
Is the Electoral Count Act a "law" that only has political but not legal 
force? 
More recently, the anti-binding problem of rule-making is 
coming to the fore in the burgeoning literature on Bush v. Gore. 
Scholars from both sides of the political aisle have taken notice of the 
point (at least in passing) in their discussions of 3 U.S.C. § 5, the so­
called "safe harbor" provision. In an article published after the case, 
Professor Tribe, a member of Vice President Gore's legal team, 
states, "There is no constitutionally prescribed method by which one 
Congress may require a future Congress to interpret or discharge a 
constitutional responsibility in any particular way."515 And in a very 
brief discussion of 3 U.S.C. § 15, he states, "It is true that even that 
procedure, untested in the 114 years during which it has been in place, 
was shadowed by constitutional doubt over the power of one 
Congress to bind its successors in such matters."516 
Likewise, in a forthcoming article, Professor Lund, a defender of 
Bush v. Gore and a proponent of Bush-pere states: 
This statute, 3 U.S.C. § 5, purports to bind Congress in 
exercising its constitutional duty to count electoral votes. I 
doubt that this can constitutionally be accomplished by a 
statute. Each house of Congress has the authority to 
determine its own rules of proceeding, and it is far from 
clear that a statute can override that authority. But even if 3 
U.S.C. § 5 is unconstitutional in this sense, that has no 
bearing on the legal issues that arose in Bush v. Gore.517 
Not surprisingly, the anti-binding principle of rule-making 
featured prominently in the Electoral Count Act debates. Several 
Senators made the point that Congress cannot bind the joint 
convention,518 and that even if Congress could bind its joint

make this argument in any of the briefs filed in Bush v. Gore.

518. On the former point that Congress cannot bind the joint convention by law or 
joint rule, Senator Stockton remarked: 
If a constitutional amendment is not necessary, then those two bodies there 
assembled have the power to regulate the way they shall count the vote, and if 
they have not the power it certainly does not exist in these two bodies sitting 
before the Congress meets, before the body to whom the Constitution of the  VP-R0000181_0134 
(2021-079) 
2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 1785 
convention, Congress cannot bind future joint conventions. Senator 
Hager put the latter point best. The counting of electoral votes was a 
self-executing constitutional duty, and according to Senator Hager, 
"[W]e cannot here establish a rule by which we dictate to another 
Congress how they shall perform a constitutional duty."519 He 
believed that neither the Twenty-second Joint Rule nor the Electoral 
Count Act would have "any binding force upon the Congress that 
must act in this matter under the Constitution."520 He colorfully 
continued: 
Can you say, sir, that you may limit your powers or add to 
them by any legislation here? Can you bind your successors 
in any matter of constitutional legislation? Turn to the 
powers that Congress has. Congress may "lay and collect 
taxes, duties, imposts, and excises." You might just as well 
undertake to pass a law here pointing out how Congress 
shall levy taxes and imposts, as to undertake to regulate 
them in the performance of a constitutional duty in regard to 
this matter. As well might one supreme court undertake to 
bind their successors as for one Congress to undertake to 
bind their successors. It cannot be done either by legislation 
or by any rule that you may see fit to adopt. 
I admit that there is an imperfection in this part of the 
Constitution as to how the joint body when assembled 
together shall proceed to act and determine the result of the 
election. But as the duty is imposed upon the Senate and the 
House of Representatives it is for them and each body that is 
called upon to act in that capacity to regulate rules for 
themselves.521 
Thus, the joint convention was to determine the rules of its own 
proceedings. But Senator Hager advanced a fallback position. He 
reluctantly admitted that Congress could regulate the proceedings of 
its own joint convention by law, but strenuously maintained that 
Congress could not regulate the proceedings of future joint 
conventions. He stated: 
United States has committed the power to count the next vote of presidential 
electors has convened. At a session before they are elected, you are here making 
laws to prevent them from doing that which was committed to them alone, and 
not to you, by the Constitution of the United States.

I admit we could pass a law here to regulate the election if 
we were to act in the matter. If we were to meet next week 
to count the electoral vote we could by the concurrence of 
both houses pass a law to regulate our action in the matter; 
but we cannot, I say, pass a law to regulate the action of a 
future House or future Senate when they meet to perform a 
constitutional duty. 522 
Senator Hager thus concluded that the Electoral Count Act bill 
"will be clearly unconstitutional."523 Other Members of Congress 
made similar statements.524 
522. Id. (emphasis added). Senator Hager also remarked: 
Id. I am satisfied that we cannot bind our successors by any legislation in regard to a 
constitutional duty that they have to perform. They themselves must judge how 
they shall perform it; and you might as well undertake to dictate that they should 
do it in a particular way to accomplish a particular result as to undertake to say 
that they shall do it according to the provisions of this bill. 
523. Id. at 511. 
524. Senator Sherman argued: 
Sir, if we put our joint rule, the whole of it, in the form of law, the Constitution 
gives to each house the power to make rules for its own government and the 
power to make joint rules for the government of the two houses. That is a 
constitutional power, and this Forty-third Congress cannot deprive the next 
Congress of the power of making rules for the government of the two houses or 
for the government of either house. There the constitutional privilege overrides 
all your laws. 
Id. at 516 (remarks of Sen. Sherman). Senator Boutwell stated: 
Here is a duty imposed upon Congress by the Constitution; it is a duty to be 
exercised at stated periods. The provision of the Constitution does not operate 
upon every Congress, but it operates upon particular Congresses. Now, can a 
Congress to which or upon which the provision of the Constitution does not 
attach at all legislate and bind the conscience and the judgment of a Congress 
that is to perform a duty imposed by the Constitution especially upon itself? I 
have great doubt upon that point, whether, if the exigency should arise when it 
would be thought desirable, so desirable as to be expedient, for one branch or 
the other of Congress to disregard the law, (and that would be just the exigency 
when probably the law should be observed,) we should not find one body or the 
other willing to take the responsibility and, upon the argument that could be 
presented, to go to the country for justification. 
Id. at 531. Senator Ingalls remarked: 
I shall be instructed far beyond my expectations if some great constitutional 
lawyer ... can assure me how any legislative enactment that we may adopt now 
or at any time can in any manner whatever bind that great political tribunal 
which is to meet to declare the result of the presidential election in 1888 .... 
[W]hether the President of the Senate is to count the vote, whether the vote is to 
be counted by the Senate and House of Representatives separately or jointly, 
whether it is to be counted by the tribunal proposed by the Senator from Ohio, 
the fact still remains that the vote is to be counted, and that no act can be passed 
by any antecedent Congress that can deprive either of the persons or any of 
those great constituent bodies of the powers that they possess and which they are 
directed to exercise under and by virtue of the twelfth article of the amendments  VP-R0000181_0136 
(2021-079) 
2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 1787 
In sum, the Electoral Count Act violates the anti-binding rule of 
rule-making because it is a law and not a rule. Ironically, the 
Electoral Count Act would be closer to constitutionality if it werr a 
rule like the Twenty-second Joint Rule. If, however, the Electoral 
Count Act were repealed and readopted as a joint rule, the 
constitutional problem would remain whether Congress may bind the 
joint convention. Constitutional structure strongly suggests that the 
joint convention has the constitutional prerogative of determining the 
rules of its own proceedings.525 
b. The Chadha Principle of Law-Making 
The Electoral Count Act's requirement that the two Houses of 
Congress concur in rejecting electoral votes in the single return case 
and to accept electoral votes in the multiple returns case is strange 
and complicated.526 This requirement is by design-recall that one 
purpose of the Electoral Count Act was to eliminate the "one House 
veto" of the Twenty-Second Joint Rule. Senator Morton, the original 
sponsor of what was to become the Electoral Count Act, stated, 
If we are to have a rule at all, if Congress is to interfere, let it 
be upon the ground on which a law is passed or a resolution 
is passed. It requires the vote of the two houses to pass a 
law, no matter how small or unimportant that law may be.527 
to the Constitution. 
17 CONG. REC. 1025 (1886). Representative Adams remarked: 
[T]he real question will arise when the two Houses meet here to pass upon the 
electoral votes in the next Presidential election; and those Houses, in my 
judgment, when they meet here to discharge a duty which is expressly imposed 
upon them by the Constitution, will not be bound by the action of the Senate and 
House of the Forty-ninth Congress and the President, when he signs this bill, if it 
shall pass. It is their duty, conferred on them by the Constitution, to count the 
votes. If for any reason whatever a single return shall appear to both Houses of 
Congress to be an invalid return they have the right so to determine; and if they 
do so determine, that vote will not be counted, however many statutes we may 
pass like this. 
18 CONG. REC. 51 (1886); see also id. at 51-52 (remarks of Rep. Adams) (similar). 
525. The critic would argue (persuasively) that the joint convention should not waste 
time determining the "shape of the table" on the important day of the electoral count. 
The two Houses of Congress are free to create a joint rule purporting to bind the joint 
convention. But the requirement of formalism remains. As the first matter of business, 
the joint convention should (and will in all likelihood) formally adopt the joint rule as its 
rule of proceeding.

1788 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 80 
Ironically, tht: concurrence of the two Houses raises significant 
constitutional problems. Consider one of the most important 
structural features of Article I: 
Every Order, Resolution, or Vote, to Which the 
Concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives 
may be necessary (except on a question of Adjournment) 
shall be presented to the President of the United States; and 
before the Same shall take Effect, shall be approved by him, 
or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two[­
]thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives, 
according to the Rules and Limitations prescribed in the 
Case of a Bill.528 
When the two Houses of Congress concur in rejecting or 
accepting electoral votes, the vote is not presented to the President­
and, as we have seen, for good reason.529 The question is whether this 
lack of presentment is constitutional. 
Scholars who have addressed this presentment problem in the 
wake of INS v. Chadha530 have doubted the existence of a 
presentment problem in the Electoral Count Act because the 
concurrent action of the two Houses in counting electoral votes is not 
legislative in nature.531 Clearly, the counting of the electoral votes is 
not legislative in nature.532 However, this conclusion does not dispose 
528. U.S. CONST. art. I,§ 7, cl. 3.

anti-President principle in presidential election). 
530. 462 U.S. 919, 958 (1983) (holding that section of Immigration and Nationality Act 
authorizing one House of Congress, by resolution, to invalidate decision of Executive 
Branch to allow a particular deportable alien to remain in the United States is 
unconstitutional, because such action is legislative and is therefore subject to the 
bicameralism and presentment requirements of Article I of the Constitution). 
531. See, e.g., GLENNON, supra note 18, at 43 ("While such an action is technically 
within the scope of the Chadha test, it is doubtful that the Constitution requires that a 
congressional objection be presented to the president" because the counting of electoral 
votes is not a "lawmaking function."); Ross & Josephson, supra note 7, at 727 n.317 ("The 
suggestion that Congress cannot exercise its counting function bicamerally without 
presidential action is probably not well taken. The [Presentment Clause] has been 
interpreted to refer only to legislative action. Whatever the houses are doing when they 
are counting electors' votes, they are not enacting laws.") (citations omitted). 
532. During the Electoral Count Act debates, some Members of Congress made this 
point. Senator George made this point with ample frequency. See, e.g., 17 CONG. REC. 
1063 (1886) (stating that "whoever does determine what votes shall be counted performs a 
judicial act"); id. at 2429 (1886) ("What kind of business is [counting electoral votes]? It 
certainly is not legislative business. It is the ascertainment of a fact and a very important 
fact to this country."); id. (stating that counting electoral votes "is not a legislative function 
which ought to be considered separately by the two Houses, but it is rather in the nature of 
a judicial function"). Senator Hoar also made the point that counting electoral votes was 
not a legislative act. See, e.g., id. at 1020 (remarks of Sen. Hoar) (judicial act). Senator  VP-R0000181_0138

of the Chadha problem. Contrary to what Professor Ross and Mr. 
Josephson have suggested, the Presentment Clause is not solely about 
legislative action.533 
The text of the Presentment Clause itself suggests as much. The 
single exception identified in the clause-"except on a question of 
Adjournment"534-is not legislative but procedural in nature. If the 
Presentment Clause is only about legislative action, why does the 
clause specify this non-legislative exception?535 There are at least two 
other exceptions to presentment in the non-legislative context, each 
with a strong justification. Presentment is not required when 
Congress proposes amendments to the Constitution under Article 
V,536 or when Congress removes an office-holding disability under 
Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment because, in each case, the 
two-thirds vote requirement is precisely that needed to override a 
Edmunds stated that "this act of receiving and counting these votes is not a legislative act, 
and I say with equal emphasis that, in my opinion, it is not a judicial act, because the 
Constitution of the United States has not imputed any such judicial power to either or 
both of the Houses." Id. at 1064. In his view, the counting of electoral votes "is an 
administrative act, the same sort of administrative act that every State which existed at the 
time of the formation of the Constitution imputed to its executive and election officers in 
the canvassing and return of votes and in the final ascertainment of them by some body, 
for the institution of every officer of a State from a justice of the peace or an overseer of 
the poor up at least to its governor." Id. 
533. See Ross & Josephson, supra note 7, at 727 n.317 ("The [Presentment] Clause has 
been interpreted to refer only to legislative action."). 
534. U.S. CONST. art. I,§ 7, cl. 3. 
535. It is arguable that the exception was inserted to simply clarify the meaning of the 
clause or out of an abundance of caution. See generally Akhil Reed Amar, Constitutional 
Redundancies and Clarifying Clauses, 33 VAL. U. L. REV. 1 (1998) (asserting that "[a] 
considerable number of constitutional clauses are redundant in a certain sense; they 
illuminate and clarify what was otherwise merely implicit"). The secret drafting history of 
the Presentment Clause suggests otherwise. For example, the Committee of Style 
inexplicably dropped the italicized language in the proposed clause: 
Every order, resolution or vote, to which the concurrence of the Senate and 
House of Representatives may be necessary ( except on a question of adjournment 
and in the cases hereinafter mentioned) shall be presented to the President for his 
revision; and before the same shall have force, shall be approved by him, or, 
being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by the Senate and House of 
Representatives, according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a 
bill. 
2 FARRAND, supra note 35, at 569 (emphasis added); see 2 id. at 594. During the Electoral 
Count Act debates, Senator Hoar asserted that "[t]here are all through the Constitution, 
among the powers of these two Houses, powers which require the concurrence of the two 
Houses for their exercise, but which, not relating to legislation, are never held to require 
the assent of the President or to be presented to the President," but failed to present any 
examples other than Article V. 17 CONG. REC. 2429.

presidential veto under the second part of the Presentment Clause.537 
Clearly, the Electoral Count Act lacks this justification: a simple 
majority vote of each House is sufficient to reject an electoral vote. 
Moreover, the Impeachment Clauses furnish an important 
background lesson. Impeachment is a paradigmatic non-legislative 
activity and presentment in case of impeachment would be 
silly--much like the case of counting electoral votes. The 
impeachment powers are finely wrought and intended to avoid 
concurrent action of the two Houses: only the House may institute an 
impeachment;538 only the Senate may try one;539 and a two-thirds 
super-majority of Senators is required for a conviction of 
impeachment.540 
This presentment problem was raised at least once during the 
Electoral Count Act debates as an argument against its 
constitutionality. Senator George called the presentment problem a 
"conclusive objection" to separate action of the two Houses.541 "[I]t is 
impossible," said Senator George, "to escape from the express 
language of the Constitution that 'every order,' not every bill, not 
every act, not every statute, but every 'order,' every 'resolution,' 
every 'vote,' in the language of the Constitution, to which the 
concurrence of the two Houses is necessary, shall be presented to the 
President for his signature."542 Senator Hoar responded that the 
Presentment Clause only related to legislative matters.543 
537. Senator George made precisely this response to Senator Hoar during the 
Electoral Count Act debates with respect to the Article V presentment question. See 17 
CONG. REC. 2429. Senator Hoar then asked if "the joint rules of the two Houses must be 
presented to the President because to their validity they require the concurrence of the 
two Houses?" Id. Senator George, relying upon the Rules of Proceedings Clause, 
responded that each House, in addition to making its own rules, "may also make rules 
besides its own separate rules for its joint action with the House, and in the same way the 
House may perform that function, and in that way reach joint rules." Id. 
538. See U.S. CONST. art. I, § 2, cl. 5 ("The House of Representatives shall chuse their 
Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment.").

Impeachments.").

]thirds of the Members present."). 
541. See 17 CONG. REC. 2428-29. Professor Ross and Mr. Josephson note that 
Representative Adams also addressed the presentment problem in Electoral Count Act 
debate in the House of Representatives in late 1886, but I fail to find any such evidence.

2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 1791 
A close reading of Chadha, unavailable of course to the 
participants in the Electoral Count Act debates, fortifies the basic 
argument made by Senator George and casts further doubt upon the 
constitutionality of the Electoral Count Act. The Chadha Court 
carefully explained why the "one-House veto" provision of the 
Immigration and Nationality Act was subject to the requirements of 
bicameralism and presentment in Article I.544 The Court began by 
noting that "[w]hether actions taken by either House are, in law and 
fact, an exercise of legislative power depends not on their form but 
upon 'whether they contain matter which is properly to be regarded 
as legislative in its character and effect."545 The Court then described 
the one-House veto provision in that case as one that "had the 
purpose and effect of altering the legal rights, duties and relations of 
persons, including the Attorney General, Executive Branch officials 
and Chadha, all outside the legislative branch,"546 which was the first 
of a series of four arguments in the Court's conclusion that the 
provision was subject to the bicameralism and presentment 
requirements of Article I.547 
The counting ( and not counting) of electoral votes by a simple 
majority of the two Houses of Congress, acting separately and 
concurrently, sounds like an action that has "the purpose and effect of 
altering the legal rights, duties and relations of persons ... outside the 
legislative branch,"548 if there ever was one. This bicameral procedure 
in counting electoral votes would therefore require presentment. 
Even if the counting of electoral votes is more properly described in 
the first instance as a "judicial act," this conclusion would not be 
changed under the Chadha Court's conception of legislative power.549 
If the Electoral Colleges Clauses require ( or permit) bicameralism 
but not presentment in counting electoral votes, the Court simply did 
not mention it.550

550. In a footnote, the Court identified one exception to the Presentment Clause, and 
suggested another. See id. at 955 n.20. The exception was for the proposal of 
constitutional amendments by two-thirds of both Houses of Congress under Article V. Id.

Furthermore, if the two-House veto provision of the Electoral 
Commission of the Hayes-Tilden Incident of 1877-which enabled 
the two Houses of Congress to overturn the findings of that 
commission without presentment-is constitutionally problematic 
under Chadha551 as Professor Tribe has recently suggested,552 it would 
surely seem to follow that the two-House veto provision of the 
Electoral Count Act-which enables the two Houses of Congress to 
overturn the "findings" of electors without presentment-is equally if 
not more constitutionally problematic under Chadha.553 
We must interpret exceptions to the Presentment Clause 
faithfully. The word "every" in the Presentment Clause means every 
and not some. Under our Constitution, there is no other instance 
where a simple majority of both Houses of Congress may affect the 
legal rights, duties, and relations of persons outside of the legislative 
branch without presentment to the President. There is no textual or 
structural reason why the counting function of the Electoral College 
Clauses should constitute an exception to this important 
constitutional rule, especially when the stakes are an entire branch of 
government. The bicameral procedure for counting electoral votes in 
the Electoral Count Act is unconstitutional under the Chadha 
principle of law-making. 
There is, however, a solution to the presentment problem in 
counting electoral votes: the unicameralism principle avoids the 
that "[o]ne might also include another 'exception' to the rule that Congressional action 
having the force of law be subject to the bicameral requirement and the Presentment 
Clauses" by pointing to the Rules of Proceedings Clause, U.S. CONST. art. I, § 5, cl. 2, as 
giving to each House "the power to act alone in determining specified internal matters." 
Chadha, 462 U.S. at 955 n.2. The Court was careful to note that "this 'exception' only 
empowers Congress to bind itself and is noteworthy only insofar as it further indicates the 
Framers' intent that Congress not act in any legally binding manner outside a close 
circumscribed legislative arena, except in specific and enumerated instances." Id. 
( emphasis added). Actually, the Court incorrectly framed the point: the Rules of 
Proceedings Clause does not apply to "Congress" but each House of Congress. The 
important point is that the Court nowhere suggested that any rule-making authority of 
Congress could be used to affect the legal rights, duties, and relations of non-Members of 
Congress without presentment to the President. See also McGinnis & Rappaport, supra 
note 508, at 495 n.60 (stating that "when the [Chadha] Court stated that the Rules of 
Proceedings Clause gave Congress the power to 'bind itself,' it meant simply that the rules 
were binding on members of Congress as opposed to individuals or institutions outside 
Congress"). 
551. See supra note 162 and accompanying text. 
552. See Tribe, supra note 27, at 278 & n.438. 
553. Indeed, the argument is an even stronger one to the extent that electors in the 
electoral colleges constitute a separate and co-ordinate branch of the federal government, 
see Kesavan, supra note 324, at 131-35, unlike the Electoral Commission of 1877 which 
was a quasi-legislative body largely drawn from Members of Congress.  VP-R0000181_0142

2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 1793 
presentment problem entirely. The Presentment Clause cannot be 
said to apply to the joint convention of Senators and Representatives 
assembled for the purpose of the electoral count, where neither the 
Senate nor the House of Representatives acts in their corporate 
capacity. 
3. Conclusions 
The structural argument reveals that the Electoral Count Act is 
unconstitutional, at least it if it is anything more than merely 
precatory. As a prima facie matter, the Electoral Count Act, to the 
extent that it is a law that has legal force, clearly violates the anti­
binding principle of rule-making. This is perhaps the strongest 
structural argument against the constitutionality of the Electoral 
Count Act. In addition, the Electoral Count Act is also 
unconstitutional in its potential operation in counting electoral votes. 
The bicameral procedure of 3 U.S.C. § 15 violates the anti-Senate 
principle of presidential election, the Chadha principle of law-making, 
and the anti-President principle of presidential election. Finally, to 
the extent that the joint convention rejects electoral votes contained 
in authentic electoral certificates as not "regularly given,"554 the 
Electoral Count Act violates the anti-Congress principle of 
presidential election, the pro-states and pro-state legislatures 
principle of presidential election, and the pro-electors principle of 
presidential election. 
III. WHAT SHOULD WE Do IF ELECTORS Go BANANAS? 
Assume that the Electoral Count Act is unconstitutional as 
argued in Part II. What happens if electors go bananas and vote for 
Professor Paulsen's dog, Gus, as President?555 What happens if 
electors go bananas and also vote for Dean Ely's dog, Portland, as 
Vice President?556 To make things even worse, suppose there is a case 
of double ( or more) such returns from the same state?

1794 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 80 
The Electoral Count Act sounds like a good statutory scheme to 
deal with these and less preposterous problems, but needless to say, 
not every good statutory scheme is a constitutional one.557 An 
argument that the Electoral Count Act is unconstitutional may 
(sadly) not be enough. The critic would argue that we deserve to 
know what should happen when inauthentic electoral certificates are 
transmitted to the seat of government, or when authentic electoral 
certificates containing unconstitutional or faithless electoral votes are 
transmitted to the same. Of course, with or without the Electoral 
Count Act, the potential problems of the electoral count remain. 
This Part seeks to placate the critic and provide answers to these 
questions. This Part proceeds in three sections. The first section 
addresses the paradigm problems of the electoral count and provides 
( or at least suggests) answers in the absence of the Electoral Count 
Act. As we shall see, the Electoral Count Act is not necessary to 
address any of the potential problems of the electoral count that may 
arise because the Constitution itself (implicitly) provides answers 
(however undesirable they may be). The second section argues that 
the Twentieth Amendment, adopted in 1933, provides a 
constitutional solution to the thorniest problem of the electoral 
count-the problem of presidential or vice presidential ineligibility. 
Given the Twentieth Amendment, the Electoral Count Act is not 
needed to address this potential problem of the electoral count. 
Finally, the third section considers where we should go from here in 
revising the current statutory scheme, assuming that some statutory 
scheme relating to counting electoral votes would be constitutional.

2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 
A. Answers to the Paradigm Problems of the Electoral Count 1795 
In Part I, we examined the paradigm problems of the electoral 
count as experienced in the electoral counts in the history of our 
Republic. It is now time to provide ( or at least suggest) some 
answers. The paradigm problems fall easily into two categories: (1) 
problems relating to the electoral certificate, and (2) problems 
relating to the electoral vote. The paradigm problems within each 
category are not of equal difficulty. Let us consider the paradigm 
problems in some rough order of increasing difficulty within each 
category. 
1. The Problems of the Electoral Certificate 
The problems of the electoral certificate share two distinguishing 
characteristics. First, they are antecedent to the problems of the 
electoral vote. Second, they, as a prima facie matter, do not require 
any knowledge of the persons receiving votes, and may therefore be 
resolved without ever looking at the names of the persons receiving 
votes. In sum, the problems of the electoral certificate relate to 
judging the authenticity or validity of the acts of electors, whereas the 
problems of the electoral vote relate to judging the acts of electors­
that is, their electoral votes. 
a. The Unsigned, Uncertified, or Unsealed Electoral 
Certificate Problem 
A first problem of the electoral certificate relates to the three 
simple elements of the electoral certificate that attest to its 
authenticity. Suppose a state should transmit an electoral certificate 
to the seat of government that is not (i) signed, (ii) certified, and (iii) 
sealed. The result would be that the joint convention must not count 
the electoral votes in this electoral certificate. 
The relevant clause of the Twelfth Amendment provides that 
"[the Electors] shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the seat of 
government of the United States, directed to the President of the 
Senate"558 the electoral certificate. Under even the "thinnest" 
conception of the counting function, the joint convention must judge 
the authenticity of the electoral certificate, distinguishing between 
what is merely the legal equivalent of a Publishers Clearinghouse 
sweepstakes entry and what is a bona fide electoral certificate. 
Indeed, the word "certify" in the Twelfth Amendment is a signal of 
558. U.S. CONST. amend. XII.  VP-R0000181_0145 
(2021-079) 
1796 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 80 
legal significance.559 The rejection of inauthentic electoral certificates 
preserves authenticity in the process of presidential election. The 
Electoral College Clauses contain an authenticity principle for good 
reason: authenticity is the principal safeguard to the risk of cabal and 
corruption in the election of the President.560 
b. The Puerto Rico, or Unrepublican State, Electoral 
Certificate Problem 
A second problem of the electoral certificate relates to the 
authenticity of its sender. Suppose Puerto Rico should transmit an 
electoral certificate to the seat of government. Or suppose that an 
unrepublican State should transmit an electoral certificate to the seat 
of government.561 Obviously, the result would be that the joint 
convention must not count the electoral votes contained in this 
electoral certificate. 
The Constitution makes clear that only states and the District of 
Columbia are entitled to appoint electors,562 and are thereby entitled 
to transmit electoral certificates. The political branches of the federal 
government have the right to recognize states in the Union.563 
559. See, e.g., 2 OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY 1054 (2d. ed. 1989) (defining "certify" 
as "[t]o declare or attest by a formal or legal certificate"). 
560. See, e.g., THE FEDERALIST No. 68, supra note 246, at 380 (Alexander Hamilton) 
("Nothing was more to be desired [in Electoral College mode of presidential election] 
than that every practicable obstacle should be opposed to cabal, intrigue, and 
corruption."). Senator King remarked: 
[M]embers of the General Convention ... did indulge the hope, by apportioning, 
limiting, and confining the Electors within their respective States, and by the 
guarded manner of giving and transmitting the ballots of the Electors to the Seat 
of Government, that intrigue, combination, and corruption, would be effectually 
shut out, and a free and pure election of the President of the United States made 
perpetual. 
3 FARRAND, supra note 35, at 461 (remarks of Sen. Rufus King). 
561. See, e.g., 18 CONG. REC. 31 (1886) (remarks of Rep. Caldwell) ("Suppose some 
State should enthrone a king, constitute a house of lords, and they should appoint electors, 
and send up but one return properly certified and finally determined as required under the 
second section of the bill proposed by the minority. Shall an American Congress count 
such a vote?"). 
562. See U.S. CONST. art. II,§ 1, cl. 2 (States); U.S. CONST. amend. XXIII, § 1 (District 
of Columbia).

recognition of a state government lies with Congress, not the courts); see also U.S. CONST.

CONST. art. IV, § 4 ("The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a 
Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against Invasion; and on 
Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be 
convened) against domestic Violence.").  VP-R0000181_0146 
(2021-079) 
2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 1797 
We have seen this problem before as well as its resolution. The 
Thirty-eighth Congress resolved not to count the electoral votes from 
eleven Southern States.564 When Congress sent the resolution to 
President Lincoln for his signature, he replied in the third person: 
The joint resolution entitled "Joint resolution declaring 
certain States not entitled to representation in the electoral 
college" has been signed by the Executive in deference to 
the view of Congress implied in its passage and presentation 
to him. In his own view, however, the two Houses of 
Congress, convened under the twelfth article of the 
Constitution, have complete power to exclude from counting 
all electoral votes deemed by them to be illegal; and it is not 
competent for the Executive to defeat or obstruct that 
power by a veto, as would be the case if his action were at all 
essential in the matter. He disclaims all right of the 
Executive to interfere in any way in the matter of canvassing 
or counting electoral votes, and he also disclaims that, by 
signing said resolution, he has expressed any opinion on the 
recitals of the preamble or any judgment of his own upon 
the subject of the resolution.565 
President Lincoln's reply suggests that Congress's power not to 
count electoral votes is quite broad, but we should be careful not to 
take it out of context of the Northerners' (Republicans') exclusion of 
Southern senators, representatives, and electors pursuant to the 
Guarantee Clause of Article IV, Section 4. 
c. The Number of Electoral Votes Problem 
A third problem of the electoral certificate relates to the 
aggregate number of electoral votes in the electoral certificate. 
Suppose a state should transmit an electoral certificate to the seat of 
government that contains more electoral votes than the number of 
electors to which that state is then entitled.566 During the Electoral 
Count Act debates, Senator Frelinghuysen distinctly noted this 
possibility that "[a] State may claim a larger representation than has 
been assigned her and may appoint more electors than she is entitled 
564. See COUNTING ELECTORAL VOTES, supra note 3, at 147-49 (House); id. at 
149-223 (Senate and House); see also Wroth, supra note 22, at 328-29 n.34. 
565. COUNTING ELECTORAL VOTES, supra note 3, at 229-30; see also Wroth, supra 
note 22, at 328-29 n.34. 
566. See U.S. CONST. art. II, § 1, cl. 2; 3 U.S.C. § 3 (2000). For ease of exposition, I will 
simply refer to electoral votes instead of two distinct lists of electoral votes for President 
and Vice President, respectively.  VP-R0000181_0147 
(2021-079) 
1798 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 80 
to, and all their votes may be returned."567 His answer was clear: "[I]f 
a State should send as votes a larger number than it was entitled to ... 
it would be a direct violation of the Constitution and an act of 
revolution for any one to count them."568 The result would be that 
the joint convention must not count the electoral votes in this 
electoral certificate.569 
Translated into a counterfactual: Suppose Florida's electoral 
certificate on January 6, 2001 contained twenty-six votes instead of 
the twenty-five votes to which Florida was then entitled. The State of 
Florida would be disenfranchised in the presidential election. 
It may be tempting to conclude that the joint convention must 
exclude one of the twenty-six votes, but which one? Must they 
exclude a randomly selected vote? It hardly seems more 
constitutional to exclude a randomly selected vote than to exclude all 
votes. What about a particular vote? In order to exclude a particular 
vote, the resolution of this problem would require knowledge of the 
persons voted for, thereby transforming a problem of the electoral 
certificate (a problem of judging the authenticity of the acts of 
electors) into a problem of the electoral vote (a problem of judging 
the acts of electors). And which vote would be excluded? There is no 
constitutional requirement that all electoral votes in an electoral 
certificate must be given for the same person.570 The joint convention 
may not exclude a particular electoral vote without affirmatively 
voting against a person voted for-an action that goes well beyond 
judging the authenticity of the acts of electors. 
567. COUNTING ELECTORAL VOTES, supra note 3, at 451. 
568. Id. 
569. This counting principle does not hold in the equal-and-opposite direction: a state 
may transmit an electoral certificate containing less electoral votes than the number of 
electors to which that state is then entitled, and these votes must be counted by the joint 
convention. Indeed, the Framers contemplated that electors would be appointed but 
would not give votes. See 2 FARRAND, supra note 35, at 515 (rejecting the motion of 
James Madison and Hugh Williamson "to insert after 'Electors' the words 'who shall have 
balloted' so that the non voting electors not being counted might not increase the number 
necessary as a majority of the whole."). 
570. The choice is reserved to the states. For example, only Maine and Nebraska have 
proportional voting instead of "winner-take-all" voting in their electoral colleges. See ME. 
REV. STAT. ANN. tit. 21-A, § 805.2 (West 1993); NEB. REV. STAT.§ 32-714 (1998). But 
even in "winner-take-all" states, the possibility looms that faithless electors will give votes 
in contravention of the popular vote. See supra notes 7, 176-91 and accompanying text; 
infra notes 590-92 and accompanying text.  VP-R0000181_0148 
(2021-079) 
2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 
d. The Multiple Electoral Certificates Problem 1799 
A fourth problem of the electoral certificate relates to the 
aggregate number of electoral certificates (returns) from a putative 
state. Suppose two or more sets of electors from the same state 
should transmit an electoral certificate to the seat of government. 
Recall the Hayes-Tilden Incident of 1877.571 One and only one of the 
following two propositions must be true as a matter of logic: (1) one 
of the electoral certificates is authentic and all others are not; or (2) 
none of the electoral certificates are authentic. Needless to say, the 
result would be that all of the electoral votes contained in the 
authentic electoral certificate must be counted and all of the electoral 
votes contained in the inauthentic electoral certificates must not be 
counted. 
The multiple returns problem may seem complicated, but it is not 
analytically different from the Puerto Rico problem of the electoral 
certificate. The authentic electoral certificate (if any) is one from the 
state; the others, insofar as the Constitution is concerned, are merely 
legally equivalent to Publishers Clearinghouse sweepstakes entries 
transmitted to the seat of government by non-states. If multiple state 
authorities should claim to be the lawful authority of a state, the joint 
convention must choose which state government is the lawful one, 
but, importantly, this choice is no more difficult than the choice 
(previously) made by each House in deciding to seat Members of 
Congress from a putative state, or the choice made by the President 
when she sends in the troops under the Guarantee Clause to protect 
one of multiple authorities that request the interposition of military 
force.572 Most importantly, the multiple returns problem is one of the 
electoral certificate and not of the electoral vote and should be 
treated as such. The joint convention should be able to determine 
which electoral certificate contains the legitimate set of electors 
without examining the names of the persons receiving votes. 
e. The Misdated Electoral Certificate Problem 
A fifth problem of the electoral certificate relates to its date. 
Suppose a state should transmit an electoral certificate to the seat of 
government that contains electoral votes given on a day different 
571. See supra notes 157-64 and accompanying text. 
572. See U.S. CONST. art. IV, § 4 ("The United States shall guarantee to every State in 
this Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against 
Invasion; and on Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature 
cannot be convened) against domestic Violence.") (emphasis added).  VP-R0000181_0149

1800 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 80 
from that specified by federal law for the giving of electoral votes.573 
Recall the Wisconsin Incident of 1857574 and the Hawaii Incident of 
1961.575 The result would be that the votes contained in this 
certificate must not be counted by the joint convention, except 
perhaps in one narrow circumstance to be discussed shortly. 
Article II, Section 1, Clause 4 provides that "[t]he Congress may 
determine the Time of chusing the electors, and the Day on which 
they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout 
the United States."576 This is a rule, inasmuch as the Constitution's 
requirement that the President be thirty-five years of age upon 
entering office is a rule;577 this is not a standard. It may be tempting 
to conclude that the joint convention could exercise discretion as to 
whether to count electoral votes given on a day different from that 
specified by federal law, especially in cases of force majeure such as 
the Wisconsin Incident of 1857. Indeed, the Constitution, to the 
extent that it is to be interpreted against the background of the 
common law, might recognize an exception for force majeure.578 This 
one narrow circumstance aside, however, the language of the 
Constitution is unmistakably clear-adherence to the date chosen is 
mandatory. More importantly, the requirement that electoral votes 
be given on the same day throughout the Union is a particularly 
important part of the authenticity principle of the Electoral College 
Clauses.579 The joint convention has the duty to support the 
573. See 3 U.S.C. § 7 (2000) ("The electors of President and Vice President of each 
State shall meet and give their votes on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in 
December next following their appointment at such place in each State as the legislature 
of such State shall direct."). 
574. See supra notes 132-42 and accompanying text. 
575. See supra notes 165-75 and accompanying text. 
576. U.S. CONST. art. II, § 1, cl. 4 (emphasis added). Admittedly, there is nothing in 
the Electoral College Clauses that expressly provides that the electors shall date the 
electoral certificate, but the requirement is fairly subsumed by that of certification. See 
U.S. CONST. amend. XII ("[The Electors] shall sign, and certify, and transmit sealed to the 
seat of the government of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate.") 
( emphasis added). Who ever heard of a legal certificate without a date? 
577. See U.S. CONST. art. II,§ 1, cl. 5. 
578. During the Electoral Count Act debates, Representative Dibble thought 
otherwise: 
[A]s in the election of any of us, if a man who is a voter does not go to the polls 
on election day and within the hours fixed by law and cast his vote, the vote is 
lost, and it makes no difference whether he was sick, or whether he was 
prevented from casting his vote by some necessity, or mischance, or design, or 
whether his vote might have changed the complexion of the election; his vote is 
lost if his right to vote is not exercised on the day designated. 
18 CONG. REC. 46 (1886) (remarks of Rep. Dibble). 
579. See, e.g., 2 FARRAND, supra note 35, at 500 (remarks of Governor Morris) ("As  VP-R0000181_0150

authenticity principle of the Electoral College Clauses, not the power 
to exercise its discretion in the matter. 
Translated into the past: Wisconsin's electoral votes in 1857 
(perhaps) should not have been counted and Hawaii's electoral votes 
in 1961 should not have been counted. Translated into a 
counterfactual: Florida's electoral votes in 2001-if given on a day 
other than December 18, 2000-should not have been counted,58° 
though Justice Ginsburg in Bush v. Gore implied otherwise.581 
the Electors would vote at the same time throughout the U.S. and at so great a distance 
from each other, the great evil of cabal was avoided. It would be impossible to corrupt 
them."); 4 ELLIOT'S DEBATES, supra note 250, at 122 (remarks of William Davie at North 
Carolina ratifying convention) ("He is elected on the same day in every state, so that there 
can be no possible combination between the electors."). At the North Carolina ratifying 
convention James Iredell remarked: 
Had the time of election been different in different states, the electors chosen in 
one state might have gone from state to state, and conferred with the other 
electors, and the election might have been thus carried on under undue 
influence. But by this provision, the electors must meet in the different states on 
the same day, and cannot confer together. They may not even know who are the 
electors in the other states. There can be, therefore, no kind of combination. It 
is probable that the man who is the object of choice of thirteen different states, 
the electors in each voting unconnectedly with the rest, must be a person who 
possesses, in high degree, the confidence and respect of his country. 
Id. at 105. 
580. One leading scholar agrees. See Michael W. McConnell, Two-and-a-Half Cheers 
for Bush v. Gore, 68 U. CHI. L. REV. 657, 676 n.93 (2001). After quoting the 
Constitution's provision that the "Day [for giving electoral votes] shall be the same 
throughout the United States," see U.S. CONST. art. II, § 1, cl. 4., Professor McConnell 
concludes, "December 18 was so designated by statute. It would be unconstitutional for 
Congress to allow the electors from a single state to give their votes on a later date." Id. 
(emphasis added). He then discusses the Hawaii Incident of 1961, see supra notes 165-75 
and accompanying text, and concludes, "That should not be treated as a precedent. In 
that election, the votes of Hawaii were not necessary to the result, and on the suggestion 
of the losing candidate, Vice President Richard Nixon, in his capacity as President of the 
Senate, were recognized as a courtesy." McConnell, supra, at 676 n.93. 
This is not to say that December 18, 2000 was a magic point in time for the 
electoral count of January 6, 2001. Political difficulties aside, there is no reason why 
Congress could not have amended 3 U.S.C. § 7 to provide that electors shall give their 
votes on a date later than December 18, 2000 and, if needed, amended 3 U.S.C. § 15 to 
provide that the joint convention shall count their votes on a date later than January 6, 
2001. Both dates, of course, could be no later than January 20, 2001 at the time of noon, 
when the terms of the President and Vice-President expired. See U.S. CONST. amend. XX, 
§ 1. The important point is that the Constitution demands that electoral votes be given on 
the same day throughout the Union-not forty-nine states on December 18, 2000 and one 
state on some other date. When Congress could have amended 3 U.S.C. § 7 is a more 
difficult question. The spirit of the Constitution suggests that, in order to minimize undue 
congressional interference and manipulation in presidential election, Congress could not 
amend 3 U.S.C. § 7 after the electors shall have given their votes on December 18, 2001 
pursuant to then-existing federal law. 
581. See Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98, 144 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) ("But none of these 
dates [including December 18, 2000, the date set by 3 U.S.C. § 7 (2000)] has ultimate  VP-R0000181_0151

1802 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW 
f. The Elector Ineligibility Problem [Vol. 80 
A sixth problem of the electoral certificate relates to the 
qualifications of the electors. Suppose that an electoral vote is given 
by an elector who is constitutionally ineligible to the office of 
elector.582 Recall the Postmaster Incident of 1837.583 The result would 
be that the votes of an elector who is constitutionally ineligible to 
hold the office of elector must be counted. 
The joint convention may not judge the manner of appointment 
or qualifications of electors.584 Once the vote of a constitutionally 
ineligible elector is transmitted in the electoral certificate, that vote is 
final and must be counted. A congressional analogy is illuminating. 
Imagine that a Representative-elect does not meet the constitutional 
qualifications prescribed by the House Qualifications Clause.585 The 
Representative is seated, performs legislative business, and is only 
subsequently expelled from the House. Are the votes of this 
Representative any less valid?586 
Most importantly, the elector ineligibility problem is impossible 
to resolve without knowing the persons voted for and the joint 
convention may not judge the acts of electors. In particular, the votes 
of a constitutionally-ineligible elector must be counted because of the 
anonymity principle of the Electoral College Clauses. 
The Electoral College Clauses protect the anonymity of electors 
in two important ways: (i) voting in the Electoral Colleges shall be by 
ballot, and (ii) the electoral certificate shall contain lists of the 
significance in light of Congress' detailed provisions for determining, on 'the sixth day of 
January,' the validity of electoral votes."). 
582. There are only two clauses that specify the qualifications of electors. See U.S. 
CONST. art. II, § 1, cl. 2 ("[B]ut no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office 
of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector."). U.S. CONST. 
amend. XIV, § 3 provides: 
No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of 
President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the 
United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a 
member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any 
State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the 
Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion 
against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress 
may by a vote of two-thirds in each House, remove such disability.

Mentor 1999) (1961) (suggesting that the votes of an "illegitimate member" of Congress 
would be valid before that member is "dispossessed" of his or her seat).  VP-R0000181_0152 
(2021-079) 
2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 1803 
persons voted for, signed and certified by the electors as a whole.587 
The votes of individual electors are not to be known in order to 
preserve the independence of the electors and the President. Senator 
Pinckney put these points brilliantly in the specific context of the 
elector ineligibility problem: 
[H]ow are [sic] Congress ... to proceed to find how these 
unduly or disqualified Electors voted, particularly if they 
should belong to a State having a number of Electors? As 
the Constitution directs they are to vote by ballot, the votes 
of the election ought to be secret. You have no right to 
require from an Elector how he voted, nor will you be able 
to know for whom he did vote, particularly if in the return 
from that State different candidates have been voted for. In 
this dilemma, I ask, what is to be done? You cannot 
discover for whom this disqualified or improperly returned 
Elector voted; and you would not certainly, in a State having 
sixteen or twenty-one votes, reject the whole, because one or 
two illegal votes have been supposed to be given.588 
Of course, it is possible to determine the persons voted for by a 
constitutionally-ineligible elector in a case of mathematical 
certainty-when all of the electoral votes for President or Vice 
President are given for the same person. But, as we have seen, there 
is no constitutional requirement that all electoral votes must be given 
for the same person.589 A non-constitutional common practice of 
"winner-take-all" voting in the electoral colleges that makes 
mathematical certainty the norm and not the exception does not 
change the answer to this constitutional question. 
587. U.S. CONST. amend. XII states that: 
The Electors shall meet in their respective States and vote by ballot for President 
and Vice-President, one of whom, at least, shall not be an inhabitant of the same 
state with themselves; they shall name in their ballots the person voted for as 
President, and in distinct ballots the person voted for as Vice-President, and they 
shall make distinct lists of all persons voted for as President, and of all persons 
voted for as Vice-President, and of the number of votes for each, which lists they 
shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the 
United States, directed to the President of the Senate.

2. The Problems of the Electoral Vote [Vol. 80 
The problems of the electoral vote share two distinguishing 
characteristics: they are problems subsequent to the problems of the 
electoral certificate and they require knowledge of the persons for 
whom the votes are cast. These problems relate to judging the acts of 
electors. 
a. The Faithless Elector Problem 
Suppose that an electoral vote is faithless-that is, in 
contravention of the known popular vote. Recall the Bailey Incident 
of 1969.590 The result would be that the votes of faithless electors 
must be counted. 
Again, the joint convention may not judge the acts of electors. 
Moreover, there is no constitutional requirement of faithfulness.591 
Frankly, it is shameful that 174 Representatives (including future 
Presidents George H.W. Bush and Gerald R. Ford) and thirty-three 
Senators who took an oath or affirmation to support the Constitution 
voted not to count Dr. Bailey's faithless vote. The answer to the 
faithless elector problem does not depend on whether state laws 
purporting to bind electors to vote in accordance with the popular 
vote are constitutional.592 Once the faithless vote is transmitted in the 
electoral certificate, that vote is final and must be counted. 
590. See supra notes 176-91 and accompanying text. 
591. See Ray v. Blair, 343 U.S. 214,232 (1952) (Jackson, J., dissenting) (explaining that 
the original understanding is that electors "would be free agents, to exercise an 
independent and nonpartisan judgment as to the men best qualified for the Nation's 
highest offices"); THE FEDERALIST No. 68, supra note 246, at 380 (Alexander Hamilton); 
Amar, supra note 10, at 230 ("The Constitution plainly contemplates that, at least 
formally, the electors must themselves decide upon their votes."). It is an open question 
whether the original understanding of 1787-1788 is the right original understanding on the 
requirement of faithfulness. The Twelfth Amendment significantly rewrote the Electoral 
College Clauses and that amendment was adopted in part with the intention of vindicating 
majoritarian popular will. See Lolabel House, Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution of 
the United States 20-40 (1901) (unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, University of 
Pennsylvania). More importantly, it does not follow that if there is no constitutional 
requirement of faithfulness that there is a constitutional requirement of faithlessness (that 
is, absolute discretion). It is an open question whether state laws that purport to bind 
electors to vote in accordance with the popular vote are constitutional. Compare, e.g., 
Amar, supra note 10, at 219 ("[T]he constitutionality of [elector-binding] laws seems 
highly dubious if we consult constitutional text, history, and structure."), with Vikram 
David Amar, The People Made Me Do It: Can the People of the States Instruct and Coerce 
Their State Legislatures in the Article V Constitutional Amendment Process?, 41 WM. & 
MARYL. REV. 1037, 1089 n.233 (2000) ( describing the question as an "open one").

binding laws).  VP-R0000181_0154 
(2021-079) 
2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 1805 
b. The Presidential or Vice Presidential Ineligibility Problem 
Suppose that an electoral vote is for a dead person-that is, in 
violation of the Presidential or Vice Presidential Eligibility Clauses.593 
Recall the Greeley incident of 1873.594 The result would be that the 
votes for a dead presidential or vice presidential candidate must be 
counted.595 
The joint convention may not judge the acts of electors. This 
answer applies with equal force to the other qualifications of the 
Presidential and Vice Presidential Eligibility Clauses-natural born 
citizen, thirty-five years of age, and fourteen years a resident within 
the United States.596 The presidential or vice presidential ineligibility 
problem is perhaps the thorniest problem of the electoral count. 
c. The Inhabitants of the Same State Problem 
Suppose that an elector votes for inhabitants of her state for both 
President and Vice President-that is, in violation of the Twelfth 
Amendment.597 This is the hypothetical Bush-Bentsen problem­
recall that Republican Vice President George H.W. Bush and 
Democrat Senator Lloyd Bentsen were both inhabitants of the State 
of Texas in the presidential election of 1988.598 The Bush-Bentsen 
593. See U.S. CONST. art. II, § 1, cl. 5 ("No Person except a natural born Citizen ... 
shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that 
Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen 
Years a Resident within the United States."); U.S. CONST. amend. XII ("But no person 
constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice­
President of the United States."). 
594. See supra notes 143-48 and accompanying text. 
595. As a prudential matter, Professor Amar has stated that "[Congress] should simply 
count the votes of a dead man as if he were alive." Akhil Reed Amar, Presidents Without 
Mandates (With Special Emphasis on Ohio), 67 U. CIN. L. REV. 375,388 (1999). 
596. U.S. CONST. art. II., § 1, cl. 6; U.S. CONST. amend. XII; see also Ross & 
Josephson, supra note 7, at 706-07 (suggesting that Greeley precedent applies to entirety 
of Presidential Eligibility Clause). 
597. See U.S. CONST. amend. XII ("The Electors shall meet in their respective states 
and vote by ballot for President and Vice-President, one of whom, at least, shall not be an 
inhabitant of the same state with themselves."). 
598. Senator Ross misstated the problem in the Sixth Congress when he asked, 
"Suppose they should vote ... for two persons who were both citizens of the same 
State ... ?" 10 ANNALS OF CONG. 29 (1800); see also COUNTING ELECTORAL VOTES, 
supra note 3, at 451 (remarks of Sen. Frelinghuysen) (making same mistake). There is no 
constitutional requirement that an elector shall not vote for two persons of the same 
state-the constitutional requirement is that an elector shall not vote for two persons of 
the same state as herself. Translated into the recent past: Electors from forty-nine states 
could constitutionally vote for both George Bush as President and Lloyd Bentsen as Vice 
President; only Texas electors could not. 
The Bush-Bentsen problem resurfaced in the presidential election of 2000. See  VP-R0000181_0155

1806 NORTH CAROLINA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 80 
problem appears to have actually occurred once in our history-in the 
presidential election of 1872-but was discovered too late in the 
electoral count for any debate.599 During the Wisconsin Incident of 
1857, Representative Humphrey Marshall pointed to the Bush­
Bentsen problem as the paradigm case for congressional power to 
exclude unconstitutional electoral votes. The Bush-Bentsen problem 
is undoubtedly the least discussed problem of the electoral count in 
the Electoral Count Act debates or in the legal academy, and yet the 
trickiest problem of all. 
There are only four possible answers for the joint convention to 
deal with the Bush-Bentsen problem during the electoral count: (1) 
count both votes, (2) reject both votes, (3) count the vote for 
President and reject the vote for Vice President, or (4) count the vote 
for Vice President and reject the vote for President. It is not at all 
difficult to winnow the set of answers by eliminating answer number 
four-the Office of President is simply more important than the 
Office of Vice President.600 This argument, however, would have 
been impossible before the adoption of the Twelfth Amendment 
which requires electors to cast "distinct ballots" for President and 
Vice President and to prepare "distinct lists" of the persons voted for 
as President and Vice President.601 Assuming that the Twelfth 
Amendment did not expand the range of possible answers to the 
Bush-Bentsen problem, we may further winnow the set of answers by 
eliminating answer number three. This leaves us with the rather 
Jones v. Bush, 122 F. Supp. 2d 713, 715 (N.D. Tex. 2000), aff d, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 
34148 (5th Cir. Tex. Dec. 7, 2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1062 (2001) (dismissing suit by 
three registered voters in Texas who alleged that Richard B. Cheney was an "inhabitant" 
of Texas and that, under the Twelfth Amendment, Texas electors were prohibited from 
voting for both George W. Bush and Richard B. Cheney). For two recent discussions in 
the legal literature of this (putative) problem, see Ho, supra note 195, passim, and 
Levinson & Young, supra note 195, at 932-54. 
599. See text accompanying supra note 154. 
600. Under our Constitution, we are never without a President, but we may be without 
a Vice President. See U.S. CONST. amend. XXV, §§ 1-2. Moreover, the President, unlike 
the Vice President, wields the power of an entire branch of Government. See U.S. CONST. 
art. II, § 1, cl. 1 ("The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States 
of America."). At least two commentators seem to agree that electoral votes for President 
are to be preferred to those for Vice President. Levinson and Young argue that: 
Common-sensically, the correct outcome is most certainly [to count the electoral 
votes for President and throw out the electoral votes for the Vice President], 
since it would seem obvious that preferences for President should be preferred 
over preferences for Vice President. . . . But this answer is hardly the only 
plausible resolution, and it is certainly not derived from the barebones text [ of 
the Twelfth Amendment].

2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 1807 
binary choice of counting both electoral votes for Bush and Bentsen 
or rejecting both electoral votes for Bush and Bentsen. Which is the 
correct answer? 
The Bush-Bentsen problem is not different in kind than the other 
two problems of the electoral vote. The joint convention must count 
both votes for Bush and Bentsen. The joint convention may not 
judge the acts of electors-period. There are two additional points to 
consider. First, the anonymity principle of the Electoral College 
Clauses indicates that the Bush-Bentsen problem is uniquely directed 
to electors, not to the joint convention.602 It would be impossible for 
the joint convention to even detect the Bush-Bentsen problem, except 
in rarest cases of mathematical certainty. Second, the Presidential 
and Vice Presidential Eligibility Clauses do not require that the 
President and Vice President be inhabitants of different states. The 
command of the Electoral College Clauses is violated the moment a 
Texas elector votes for both Bush and Bentsen, but the Presidential 
and Vice Presidential Eligibility Clauses are not violated if Bush 
becomes President and Bentsen becomes Vice President. We might 
therefore think about the Bush-Bentsen problem in a broader 
context, just as we might think about presidential impeachment in a 
broader context.603 The command of the Electoral College Clauses 
probably was inserted to enhance the legitimacy of presidential 
election by lessening the probability that the ultimate choice would be 
made by the House of Representatives, but the Framers thought that 
most presidential elections would be decided by the House anyway.604 
602. See supra notes 587-88 and accompanying text (discussing anonymity principle of 
Electoral College Clauses). 
603. See, e.g., Akhil Reed Amar, An(Other) Afterword on the Bill of Rights, 87 GEO. 
L.J. 2347, 2358-59 (1999) (criticizing application of "blinkered textualism" to standard for 
presidential impeachment and arguing that presidential impeachment requires a higher 
standard than that for judges or cabinet officers, although the Constitution lumps 
presidential impeachment with all other impeachments). 
604. See, e.g., 2 FARRAND, supra note 35, at 500 (remarks of George Mason) 
("[N]ineteen times in twenty the President would be chosen by the Senate."); id. at 512 
(remarks of George Mason) ("[I]t will rarely happen that a majority of the whole votes 
will fall on any one candidate."); THE FEDERALIST No. 66, supra note 432, at 372 
(Alexander Hamilton} ("The same house [House of Representatives] will be the umpire in 
all elections of the President which do not unite the suffrages of the majority of the whole 
number of electors; a case which it cannot be doubted will sometimes, if not frequently 
happen."). But see 2 FARRAND, supra note 35, at 501 (remarks of Abraham Baldwin) 
("The increasing intercourse among the people of the States, would render important 
characters less & less unknown; and the Senate [under the Constitution as adopted and 
amended, the House of Representatives] would consequently be less & less likely to have 
the eventual [presidential] appointment thrown into their hands."). History has proved 
Mr. Baldwin to be correct.

3. Conclusions [Vol. 80 
What shall we make of this rearrangement of the deck chairs on 
the Titanic? The problems of the electoral certificate relate to 
judging the authenticity of the acts of electors, whereas the problems 
of the electoral vote relate to judging the acts of electors. The 
Constitution trusts the joint convention to do the former, but not the 
latter. 
The counting function inherently requires some sort of a rule of 
recognition for deciding what is to be counted and what is not ( this is 
the "thinnest" conception of judging). The President of the Senate 
receives a lot of mail, and the joint convention must be able to decide 
what mail contains an authentic electoral certificate and must be 
counted, and what mail contains the legal equivalent of a Publishers 
Clearinghouse sweepstakes entry and must be discarded. The 
Constitution specifies the criteria for authenticity and trusts the joint 
convention to judge the authenticity of the acts of electors. 
Moreover, the problems of the electoral certificate may be resolved 
without any knowledge of the persons receiving votes. We should 
therefore be less suspicious of undue interference or manipulation by 
the joint convention because the joint convention could ( and should) 
be behind a veil of ignorance as to the problems of authenticity of the 
acts of electors. · 
The problems of the electoral vote are of a fundamentally 
different order. The rule of recognition does not address these 
problems which require knowledge of the persons voted for in the 
presidential election in order to be solved. The threat of undue 
interference or manipulation by the joint convention is hence more 
pressing. The Constitution does not trust the joint convention to 
judge the acts of electors, but plainly contemplates that the electors 
shall have the last word on who shall receive votes. 
B. The Twentieth Amendment 
Although the joint convention may not solve problems of the 
electoral vote, we are not resigned to the possibility of 
unconstitutional Presidents or Vice Presidents (if electors do truly go 
bananas). It turns out that We the People remedied (without really 
knowing it) the thorniest problem of the electoral count-the 
requirement to be all-important. His private, unadopted draft of the Constitution contains 
a provision providing that electors "shall proceed to vote by ballot for a President, who 
shall not be one of their own number, unless the Legislature upon experiment should 
hereafter direct otherwise." 3 FARRAND, supra note 35, at 622-23 ( emphasis added).  VP-R0000181_0158

2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 1809 
presidential or vice presidential ineligibility problem-with the 
adoption of the Twentieth Amendment in 1933. Section 3 of that 
amendment provides: 
If, at the time fixed for the beginning of the term of the 
President, the President elect shall have died, the Vice 
President elect shall become President. If a President shall 
not have been chosen before the time fixed for the 
beginning of his term, or if the President elect shall have 
failed to qualify, then the Vice President elect shall act as 
President until a President shall have qualified; and the 
Congress may by law provide for the case wherein neither a 
President elect nor a Vice President elect shall have qualified, 
declaring who shall then act as President, or the manner in 
which one who is to act shall be selected, and such person 
shall act accordingly until a President or Vice President shall 
have qualified.605 
Section 3 contains a "textually demonstrable commitment"606 of 
power to Congress to remedy the situation when electors go bananas: 
"Congress may by law provide for the case wherein neither a 
President elect nor a Vice President elect shall have qualified .... "6rn 
The text of this section of the Twentieth Amendment does not 
declare who decides whether the President-elect or Vice President­
elect have failed to qualify or when they shall have qualified. 
Constitutional structure strongly suggests that neither the President 
nor Congress makes these determinations.608 These determinations 
seem very much like judicial ones subject to the province of the 
judicial department.609 These determinations are surely no less

607. U.S. CONST. amend. XX, § 3. Section 3 of the Twentieth Amendment 
embarrassingly does not specify who shall act as Vice President when electors go bananas. 
The Twenty-fifth Amendment only complicates this problem: "Whenever there is a 
vacancy in the office of the Vice President, the President shall nominate a Vice President 
who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress." 
U.S. CONST. amend. XXV, § 2. The spirit of section 3 of the Twentieth Amendment 
suggests that this person is to act as Vice President until a Vice President shall have 
qualified.

justiciable than deciding whether a Representative-elect has met all of 
the qualifications set forth in Article I, Section 2, Clause 2.610 
The Twentieth Amendment provides a constitutional solution to 
the presidential or vice presidential ineligibility problem of the 
electoral vote. The Twentieth Amendment guarantees that we will 
not be without a constitutionally-qualified President when electors go 
bananas.611 What does the Twentieth Amendment mean for the 
counting of electoral votes? The Twentieth Amendment "preempts" 
the joint convention in judging the acts of electors. The joint 
convention must count electoral votes contained in authentic 
electoral certificates. 
There is an important difference between the constitutional 
solution provided by the Twentieth Amendment and any rough-and­
ready solution that may be provided by the joint convention. Take a 
much less silly case than Professor Paulsen's Gus-the-Dog 
hypothetical.612 Imagine that in the next presidential election a 
majority of the whole number of electors appointed vote for 
presidential candidate Smith. Smith is exactly thirty-four years of age 
as of noon on January 20, 2005, the date fixed by the Constitution for 
the beginning of the next presidential term,613 and is therefore not 
constitutionally-qualified to be President.614 If the joint convention 
rejected these electoral votes for thirty-four year old Smith as not 
"regularly given," the joint convention would trigger a contingency 
election in the House of Representatives, and Smith would be 
excluded from the Office of President for the next four years. But if 
these unconstitutional electoral votes were counted, then Smith's 
nmning-mate (who we will assume is constitutionally-qualified to be 
Vice President) would simply act as President, until Smith shall have 
qualified for the Office of President on January 20, 2006. To be sure, 
610. See Powell v. McCormack, 395 U.S. 486, 516-49 (1969). 
611. There is one truly exceptional situation that the Twentieth Amendment solves 
that the joint convention could not. Imagine that all of persons voted for by the electors 
for President and Vice President were unconstitutional. Even though the joint convention 
could pursuant to the Electoral Count Act reject enough of these unconstitutional votes to 
trigger contingency elections for President in the House of Representatives and for Vice 
President in the Senate, the House and the Senate would be required to choose the 
President and Vice President, respectively, from a list of unconstitutional candidates. 
612. See Paulsen, supra note 555, at 222. 
613. See U.S. CONST. amend. XX, § 1 ("The terms of the President and Vice President 
shall end at noon on the 20th day of January, and the terms of Senators and 
Representatives at noon on the 3d day of January, of the years in which such terms would 
have ended if this article had not been ratified; and the terms of their successors shall then 
begin.").

this hypothetical situation could never apply to the cases when 
electors really go bananas---when they vote for dead persons or law 
professors' dogs as President or Vice President. The important point 
for present purposes is that the joint convention must count electoral 
votes contained in authentic electoral certificates because the 
Twentieth Amendment carefully prescribes the result when the 
electors shall have made an unconstitutional choice. 
C. Revising the Electoral Count Act 
Assume that Congress may by law bind the joint convention and 
future joint conventions in counting electoral votes, and that 
Congress has the font of implied power to enact such a law. In other 
words, assume that some electoral count act is constitutional. If we 
are to revise the Electoral Count Act to make it constitutional ( and 
better), what should it look like?615 
The Electoral Count Act should be revised in the following ways. 
First, some Senator or Representative then and there present at the 
electoral count shall be the presiding officer of the joint convention, 
not the Vice President as the President of the Senate. Second, the 
quorum for the joint convention shall be two-thirds of the total 
number of Senators and Representatives, keeping in spirit with the 
Constitution's requirement that a quorum in the House of 
Representatives for choosing the President be a Member or Members 
from two-thirds of the states.616 Third, the phrase not "regularly 
given" shall be narrowly construed only to include problems of the 
electoral certificate and to exclude problems of the electoral vote, 
clarifying that the joint convention may judge the authenticity of the 
electors' acts, but not the electors' acts themselves. Fourth, any and 
all objections in counting electoral votes shall be addressed by the 
joint convention voting on a per capita basis, thereby avoiding the 
presentment problem of the Electoral Count Act. Fifth, the 
proceedings of the joint convention shall be public. Sixth, in the 
event the electors fail to make a choice for President or Vice 
President, the choice of the President by the House of 
615. Other commentators have taken initial stabs at this question. See Glennon, supra 
note 517; L. Kinvin Wroth, Election 2000: The Disease and the Cure, VT. BJ. 53, 53-54

CONCLUSION 
Just because a certain constitutional problem is peculiar and rare 
is no reason to ignore it--especially when the stakes are an entire 
branch of government. To borrow the words of Senator Morton 
describing the Twenty-second Joint Rule, the Electoral Count Act is a 
"a torpedo planted in the straits with which the ship of state may at 
some time come into fatal collision."617 When this happens, it will 
happen, by definition, at a worse time. We should be thinking about 
the constitutionality of the Electoral Count Act now--well in advance 
of a constitutional crisis--when the political facts of the moment are 
least likely to distort our considered legal judgment. Both Houses of 
Congress should immediately hold hearings on the constitutionality of 
the Electoral Count Act and perhaps on the desirability of the 
electoral college mode of presidential election more generally. 
Consider that we came perilously close to facing the 
constitutionality of 3 U.S.C. § 15 head on just a short while ago. 
Imagine the following hypothetical: 
The Supreme Court does not intervene in Bush v. Gore on 
December 10, 2000 or on December 12, 2000. The recount in Florida 
proceeds. A slate of Bush-Cheney electors, appointed by the Florida 
Legislature on December 12, 2000, gives its votes on December 18, 
2000. This electoral certificate is certified by Florida Secretary of 
State Katherine Harris. The recount in Florida proceeds. Vice 
President Gore and Senator Lieberman are declared the winners of 
the popular vote for President and Vice President respectively. A 
slate of Gore-Lieberman electors, appointed under Florida election 
law, gives its votes on some day after December 18, 2000, but before 
January 6, 2001. And now the important twist-this electoral 
certificate is also certified by Florida Secretary of State Katherine 
Harris. 
The joint convention convenes on January 6, 2001 for the 
purpose of counting the electoral votes. The electoral count proceeds 
smoothly until Vice President Gore opens both certificates from the 
State of Florida and hands them to the teller for reading, when the 
joint convention borders on disorder. Objections are made, received, 
and read before the joint convention by Vice President Gore. Some 
objections state that this is a case of single returns, and pointing to 3

2002] ELECTORAL COUNT ACT 1813 
U.S.C. § 5, state that the electoral votes contained in the Bush­
Cheney electoral certificate must be counted, unless both Houses 
concur in rejecting them. Some objections state that this is a case of 
single returns, and pointing to the precedent of Hawaii in 1961, state 
that the electoral votes contained in the Gore-Lieberman electoral 
certificate must be counted unless both Houses concur in rejecting 
them. Some objections state that this is a case of double returns, and 
pointing to § 15, state that none of the electoral votes contained in 
either the Bush-Cheney or Gore-Lieberman electoral certificates 
must be counted unless the two Houses concur in accepting one of 
them. Both Houses will likely not concur, with the House controlled 
by the Republicans and the Senate evenly split among Republicans 
and Democrats (put aside, for the moment, the legal fiction of Vice 
President Gore breaking any tie in the Senate in favor of himself and 
the Democrats). If none of Florida's electoral votes are counted, the 
result of the electoral count will likely be 268 votes for Vice President 
Gore and Senator Lieberman and 246 votes for Governor Bush and 
Mr. Cheney. Gore and Lieberman will not have a majority of the 
whole number of electors appointed if Florida's twenty-five electors 
are counted as properly appointed electors, but will comfortably have 
more than a majority of the whole number of electors appointed if 
Florida's twenty-five electors are not counted. The Senate and House 
immediately withdraw to decide on the objections not at all knowing 
what will happen when they reconvene. What result? 
We need not wait for the Supreme Court to decide the 
constitutionality of the Electoral Count Act in a moment of 
constitutional crisis. Members of Congress take an oath or 
affirmation to support the Constitution. A conscientious legislator 
should vote to repeal the Electoral Count Act and a conscientious 
President should sign such legislation. This will not be enough. The 
problems of the electoral count are festering sores in our 
Constitution. A very conscientious legislator should vote to propose 
a constitutional amendment to solve the problems of the electoral 
count once and for all.  VP-R0000181_0163

Preparing for a Disputed Presidential Election: 
An Exercise in Election Risk Assessment 
and Management 
Edward B. Foley* 
This Article considers the possibility that a major dispute over the 
outcome of the 2020 presidential election could arise, even without foreign 
interference or some other extraordinary event, but rather just from the 
ordinary process of counting ballots. Building upon previous research on 
the "blue shift" phenomenon, whereby acijustments in vote tallies during the 
canvassing of returns tends to advantage Democratic candidates, it is easy 
to imagine a dispute arising if this kind of "blue shift" were consequential 
in the presidential race. Using examples from both Pennsylvania and 
Arizona, two states susceptible to significant "blue shifts" in previous 
elections, the article shows how the dispute could reach Congress, where it 
potentially might metastasize into a full-fledged constitutional crisis. The 
most frightening scenario is where the dispute remains unresolved on 
January 20, 2021, the date for the inauguration of the new presidential term, 
and the military is uncertain as to who is entitled to receive the nuclear codes 
as commander-in-chief In order to avoid this risk, Congress should amend 
the relevant statute, 3 U.S. C. § 15.

INTRODUCTION 
It is Election Night 2020. This time it is all eyes on Pennsylvania, as 
whoever wins the Keystone State will win an Electoral College majority. 
Trump is ahead in the state by 20,000 votes, and he is tweeting "The race 
is over. Another four years to keep Making America Great Again." 
The Associated Press (AP) and the networks have not yet declared 
Trump winner. Although 20,000 is a sizable lead, they have learned in 
recent years that numbers can shift before final, official certification of 
election results. They are afraid of "calling" the election for Trump, only 
to find themselves needing to retract the call-as they embarrassingly did 
twenty years earlier, in 2000. Trump's Democratic opponent, ___ _ 
(fill in the blank with whichever candidate you prefer; I will pick 
Elizabeth Warren since at the moment she is the front-runner according 
to prediction markets), 1 is not conceding, claiming the race still too close 
to call. Both candidates end the night without going in front of the 
cameras. 
In the morning, new numbers show Trump's lead starting to slip, and 
by noon it is below 20,000. Impatient, Trump holds an impromptu press 
conference and announces:

2019] Preparing for a Disputed Presidential Election 
I've won reelection. The results last night showed that I won 
Pennsylvania by over 20,000 votes. Those results were complete, with 
100 percent of precincts reporting. As far as I'm concerned, those 
results are now final. I'm not going to let machine politicians in 
Philadelphia steal my reelection victory from me--or from my voters! 311 
Despite Trump's protestations, the normal process of canvassing 
election returns continues in Pennsylvania, and updated returns continue 
to show Trump's lead slipping away. First, it drops below 15,000. Then 
10,000. Then 5,000. As this happens, Trump's tweets become 
increasingly incensed-and incendiary. "STOP THIS THEFT RIGHT NOW!!!" 
"DON'T LET THEM STEAL THIS ELECTION FROM YOU!!!" 
Protestors take to the streets, in Pennsylvania and elsewhere. So far, 
the demonstrations, while rancorous, have remained nonviolent. Amid 
police protection, the canvassing process in Pennsylvania has continued, 
and Trump's lead in the state diminishes even further. 
Then, several days later, the lead flips. Now, Warren is ahead in 
Pennsylvania. First by only a few hundred votes. Then, by a couple of 
thousand votes. Although the AP and networks continue to declare the 
race "too close to call," it is Warren's tum to take to the cameras declaring 
victory. 
Trump insists, by tweet and microphone, "THIS THEFT WILL NOT 
STAND!!!" "WE ARE TAKING BACK OUR VICTORY." 
So begins the saga over the disputed result of the 2020 presidential 
election. 
This scenario is certainly plausible. Pennsylvania is, indeed, a pivotal 
state in the 2020 presidential election-and potentially poised to be the 
single state upon which the entire election turns. That role could also fall 
to Wisconsin, or Florida again, or even Arizona. But it just as easily could 
be Pennsylvania.2 
Moreover, if the idea of a 20,000-lead on Election Night evaporating 
entirely during the canvassing of returns seems implausible, think again. 
Trump's lead over Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania did not disappear 
completely, but it did drop by over 20,000 votes-23,659, to be precise­
between Election Night and the final, official certification of the result in 
the state.3 Nor was that a fluke. In 2018, the Democratic candidates for

vote margin between Mr. Trump and Secretary Clinton), with GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF THE

both governor and United States senator in Pennsylvania increased their 
leads over their Republican opponents by over 28,000 votes during the 
equivalent canvassing period in that midterm election. 4 Moreover, in 
each of the three presidential elections before 2016 (2004, 2008, and 
2012), the Democratic candidate gained over 22,000 votes in 
Pennsylvania between Election Night and final certification of the official 
results.5 
Thus, it is not unreasonable to expect Trump's Democratic opponent 
in 2020 to gain on Trump by over 20,000 votes in Pennsylvania during 
the period between Election Night and the final, official certification of 
the canvass. The key question is whether this kind of gain simply extends 
a lead that the Democratic candidate already has, comparable to what 
occurred in two statewide races in 2018. Or whether, instead, it cuts into 
a lead that Trump starts with on Election Night-and, if so, whether it is 
enough of a gain for Trump's Democratic opponent to overcome Trump's 
Election Night lead. In 2016, Hillary Clinton's gain of 23,659 votes 
during the canvassing process was not enough to flip Pennsylvania to her 
column. Instead, it reduced a Trump lead of 67,951 in the state to "only" 
44,292.6 But in 2020 a comparable gain for the Democrat could erase 
entirely a 21,000-vote Election Night lead for Trump, converting the 
result into a 2,500-vote margin of victory for the Democrat. 
Pennsylvania is hardly aberrational in producing this kind of gain for 
Democratic candidates during the canvassing process. Although this 
phenomenon is still not widely understood by the electorate generally, 
scholars and even the media have begun to take notice. In 2014, I 
published an article entitled The Big Blue Shift to draw attention to this 
development, hypothesizing that it is best explained as an unintended 
byproduct of electoral reforms adopted in the wake of the 2000 fiasco,

most specifically the advent of provisional ballots and the increased use 
of absentee voting. 7 (One possible factor is that provisional ballots, which 
became nationally mandated by the Help America Vote Act of 2002 and 
which are necessarily counted during the canvassing process after 
Election Night once their validity has been verified, tend to be cast by 
voters of demographic groups who support Democratic candidates. But 
while this factor undoubtedly contributes to the phenomenon, the number 
of provisional ballots generally is not large enough to account for the 
entirely of the "blue shift" phenomenon, and the remainder of the 
explanation is still uncertain.) Whatever the exact causal mechanism­
we are still in the early stages of studying the phenomenon-this kind of 
"overtime" gain by Democrats, after Election Night and before final 
certification of the canvass, achieved national salience in the 2018 
midterms.8 
Indeed, this blue shift flipped the result of one major election: the 
Arizona US Senate race. Martha McSally, the Republican candidate, held 
a lead of 15,403 votes a day after Election Day.9 But by the time the 
canvassing of returns was complete, her Democratic opponent, Kyrsten 
Sinema had won by 55,900-a gigantic overtime gain of 71,303 votes 
during the canvassing process. IO ' 
But most consideration of the blue shift in 2018 focused on Florida. 
Both the United States Senate and governor's races in that perennial 
battleground ended up extremely close. A day after Election Day, the 
Republican candidates were ahead in both, but by only 30,264 votes in 
the Senate race and only 50,879 in the gubernatorial election.I I As the

blue shift started to erode these leads, Republicans became fearful that 
their leads, like McSally's in Arizona, might disappear completely. 
Trump himself took to Twitter, proclaiming: "The Florida Election 
should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large 
numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are 
missing or forged. An honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots 
massively infected. Must go with Election Night!"12 
Ultimately, the GOP held on to win both these statewide races. The 
Democratic candidate for Senate, incumbent Bill Nelson, gained 20,231 
votes during the canvass, but that still left Rick Scott with a narrow 
10,033-vote margin ofvictory. 13 Likewise, the Democratic candidate for 
governor, Andrew Gillum, gained 18,416, leaving Ron DeSantis with a 
somewhat more comfortable 32,463-vote margin.14 
Still, 2018 made this much clear: If the blue shift in a prominent 
midterm election can cause Trump to tweet about sticking with the 
Election Night tally in order to preserve a Republican lead, it is easy to 
imagine him doing something similar in the context of his own reelection 
effort in 2020. Thus, if Pennsylvania were to end up the pivotal state in 
the presidential election, and if Trump were to have a narrow lead there 
on Election Night, we can expect him to do whatever he can-tweeting 
and more-to freeze that lead in place and prevent a blue shift from 
erasing it. 
We can endeavor to contemplate all the different ways Trump might 
try to stop an Election Night lead from slipping away, whether through 
litigation or otherwise. Fundamentally, however, it makes sense to focus 
on the possibility that there remains a basic conflict over the outcome of 
a pivotal state, like Pennsylvania. Ori the one hand, Trump keeps insisting 
that only the Election Night results, which show him in the lead, are valid. 
On the other hand, if the canvassing process does show that lead 
evaporating, thereby putting Trump's Democratic opponent ahead (or 
even just potentially so), then the Democrats will insist that the results 
shown by the canvass are the valid ones. The key question, then, is how 
this basic dispute plays out-and ultimately gets resolved.

I. FROM NOVEMBER 3, 2020 THROUGH DECEMBER 14, 2020 
A. What Could Happen 315 
Despite protests and counter-protests, and lawsuits and counter­
lawsuits--each side accusing the other of attempting to steal an election 
that is rightfully theirs-Pennsylvania's election officials certify the 
result as a miniscule 2,500-vote victory for Warren, based on the strength 
of the "overtime" votes counted during the canvassing process. This 
official certification, of course, is not technically that Warren herself has 
won Pennsylvania's electoral votes, but rather than the slate of 
presidential electors pledged to Warren have won, based on the popular 
vote, the right to serve as the state's electors. Pennsylvania's governor so 
certifies pursuant to state law.15 Also, as required by Congress, the 
governor sends this "certificate of ascertainment" to the National 
Archives, thereby notifying the federal government who has been 
officially appointed the state's electors.1 6 These electors then meet on the 
day appointed by Congress (Monday, December 14) and indeed cast their 
20 electoral votes for Warren. These electors then dutifully transmit a 
certificate of their votes to "the President of the Senate," as well as 
sending a copy to the National Archives, both submissions as specified 
by Congress. I 7 
But this is not all that happens in Pennsylvania during this time. At 
Trump's urging, the state's legislature-where Republicans have 
majorities in both houses-purports to exercise its authority under Article 
II of the Constitution to appoint the state's presidential electors directly. 
Taking their cue from Trump, both legislative chambers claim that the 
certified popular vote cannot be trusted because of the blue shift that 
occurred in overtime. Therefore, the two chambers claim to have the 
constitutional right to supersede the popular vote and assert direct 
authority to appoint the state's presidential electors, so that this 
appointment is in line with the popular vote tally as it existed on Election 
Night, which Trump continues to claim is the "true" outcome. The state's 
Democratic governor refuses to assent to this assertion of authority by the 
state's legislature, but the legislature's two chambers proclaim that the 
governor's assent is unnecessary. They cite early historical practices in 
15. See 25 PA. STAT. AND CONS. STAT. ANN. § 3166 (West 2019) ("[O]n receiving and 
computing the returns of the election of presidential electors ... the Governor ... shall enumerate 
and ascertain the number of votes given for each person so voted for, and shall cause a certificate 
of election to be delivered .... "). 
16. 3 u.s.c. § 6 (2018). 
17. See 3 U.S.C. § 11 (2018) ("They shall forthwith forward by registered mail one of the 
(certificates so made by them] to the President of the Senate at the seat of government.").  VP-R0000183_0008 
(2021-079) 
316 Loyola University Chicago Law Journal [Vol. 51 
which state legislatures appointed presidential electors without any 
involvement of the state's governor.18 They argue that like constitutional 
amendments, and unlike ordinary legislation, the appointment of 
presidential electors when undertaken directly by a state legislature is not 
subject to a gubernatorial veto.19 
Although the governor refuses to certify this direct legislative 
appointment of presidential electors, the Republican-pledged electors 
who have been purportedly appointed by the legislature proceed to 
conduct their own meeting on the day that Congress has specified for the 
casting of electoral votes (again, Monday, December 14). At this meeting, 
they cast "their" 20 electoral votes for Trump. They, too, purport to 
certify these votes by sending a certificate to the President of the Senate 
and a copy to the National Archives, according to the procedures 
specified by Congress. 
Thus, when Congress meets on January 6, 2021 to count the electoral 
votes from the states, there are two conflicting certificates of electoral 
votes from Pennsylvania. One submission, from the Democratic electors 
and reflecting the governor's certificate of ascertainment, records 
Pennsylvania's 20 electoral votes for Warren. The other, from the 
Republican electors and reflecting the legislature's purported direct 
appointment, records Pennsylvania's electoral votes for Trump. 
And so, the controversy over Pennsylvania has reached Congress. 
B. Analysis 
It might seem far-fetched to think that the Pennsylvania legislature 
would attempt to negate the popular vote of the state's electorate in the 
18. See EDWARD B. FOLEY, PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS AND MAJORJTY RULE: THE RISE, 
DECLINE, AND POTENTIAL RESTORATION OF THE JEFFERSONIAN ELECTORAL COLLEGE 16-~26, 
55-61 (2019) (recounting practices of state legislatures both before and after adoption of the 
Twelfth Amendment). 
19. One could consider the possibility that Pennsylvania's governor, or judiciary, might attempt 
to prevent the two chambers of the state's legislature meeting for this purpose. For this analysis, I 
shall assume that any such attempt would either not occur or not be successful. At the extreme, the 
Republican members of the state legislature would likely be able to find a place to assemble, even 
if it were not the official statehouse even if their meeting otherwise lacked the appearance of an 
official session of the state's legislative chambers. Even so, these Republican members of the state 
legislature could purport to be engaged in an official legislative session, even if meeting in unusual 
circumstances, and thus could purport to be appointing the state's presidential electors pursuant to 
the state legislature's constitutional authority to do so. The Trump-pledged Republican electors 
then could assert that they were meeting pursuant to this purported legislative appointment. 
(Moreover, even if these irregular legislative sessions never occurred, the Trump-pledged 
Republican electors might themselves meet, saying that they would have been appointed by the 
state's legislature if the legislature had not unlawfully been denied the opportunity to assemble, and 
thus their electoral votes should be considered by Congress as valid as if the legislature has 
successfully met to appoint them.)  VP-R0000183_0009 
(2021-079) 
2019] Preparing for a Disputed Presidential Election 317 
2020 presidential election. Even with Trump urging Republicans to make 
this move, it might be too much of a power grab. One would hope that 
American politics have not become so tribal that a political party is 
willing to seize power without a plausible basis for doing so rooted in the 
actual votes of the citizenry.20 
Thus, ultimately, the likelihood of this scenario occurring may depend 
upon how much doubt can be cast upon the officially certified canvass of 
the popular vote-and thus the plausibility of the claim that the blue shift 
in the overtime count amounts to a theft of an Election Night victory that 
was rightfully Trump's. If during the canvass itself, Trump can gain 
traction with his allegation that the blue shift amounts to fraudulently 
fabricated ballots-along the lines of his 2018 tweet about Florida-then 
it becomes more politically tenable to claim that the legislature must step 
in and appoint the state's electors directly to reflect the "true" will of the 
state's voters, who otherwise would be deprived of the result they 
mandated as reflected on Election Night. (In 2000, Florida's legislature 
was preparing to take this kind of step, which became unnecessary once 
the Supreme Court halted the recount.)21 
Unless and until we are in the midst of the situation itself, we can only 
speculate the kind of allegations that might be raised in an effort to cast 
doubt on overtime votes counted during the canvass. Presumably 
provisional ballots would be attacked as ineligible for counting, as would 
any absentee ballots not previously counted, because when one is ahead 
and attempting to preserve a lead, the goal is to shut down the counting 
process as much as possible. Heavily Democratic precincts would be 
closely scrutinized for any voting irregularities. An effort might be made 
to invalidate entire precincts, especially in urban areas, based on slight 
discrepancies-as often occur for innocent reasons-between the number 
of voters who sign the precinct's pollbooks and the number of ballots cast 
in the precinct.22 Drawing upon the historical legacy of improper 
20. But there is increasing concern that both major political parties in the U.S. do not share a 
commitment to conduct their electoral competition by means of a fair democratic process. See, e.g.,

practices conducted by big-city machine politicians, including in 
Philadelphia, one can easily imagine Trump and his Republican 
supporters pointing to any evidence that might support a narrative of 
Philadelphian misdeeds undermining his victory. It would not take much 
to set this tale spinning. Remember what happened in Florida in 2018, 
specifically in Broward County: There, the local election administrator 
acted improperly with respect to the handling of ballots, and that became 
a potential basis for challenging the entire result statewide. If something 
similar happened in Philadelphia, one can imagine that Republicans 
would invoke it as grounds for discarding the results of the canvass and 
substituting instead directly appointed presidential electors. 
Undoubtedly, Trump would go to court in an effort to prevent 
certification of the canvass based on the blue shift "overtime" vote. He 
would certainly be in a more favorable posture if a judicial decree blocked 
the counting of these extra votes and required, instead, that the canvass 
be certified with a result showing Trump having won the popular vote in 
the state. Even better, from Trump's perspective, would be a court order 
requiring the state's governor to certify a popular vote victory for his 
Republican slate of electors. Then there would be no need for the state 
legislature to appoint the Republican electors directly, and no conflicting 
submissions to Congress of two separate certificates of electoral votes 
from Pennsylvania. Instead, the President of the Senate would receive a 
single submission, based on this judicial decree, showing only Trump to 
have won the state's 20 electoral votes. Thus, Trump almost certainly 
would try to obtain this kind of court decree, either from state or federal 
court-or even both. 
But Trump need not win in court in order to press his case to Congress. 
As long as he gets the state legislature to appoint his presidential electors 
directly, and those electors submit their purported electoral votes to the 
President of the Senate-who happens to be his vice president, Mike 
Pence-he has a fighting chance. His position is much weaker than if 
Pennsylvania sends Pence only one certificate of electoral votes that 
supports him. But Trump has no chance at all if Pennsylvania sends only 
one certificate that supports Warren.23 Thus, if Trump cannot get a court 
to block the governor's certificate of ascertainment showing Warren's 
electors as duly appointed based on their popular-vote victory, then it is 
imperative from Trump's perspective that the state legislature purport to 
supersede this popular vote with its own direct appointment of the state's 
23. This point assumes that the Democrats will control the House of Representatives, which 
will vote to accept the 20 electoral votes from Pennsylvania in favor of Warren. Only if Mike Pence 
could get away with nullifying those votes solely on his own (without any conflicting electoral 
votes from the state in favor of Trump )--an exceedingly implausible scenario--{;ould Trump 
prevail in preventing Pennsylvania from giving Warren an Electoral College majority.  VP-R0000183_0011

presidential electors-and for Pence to receive from Pennsylvania a 
second certificate of electoral votes, ones cast for Trump based on this 
purported legislative appointment. 
There is good reason to think that this purported legislative 
appointment of electors would be invalid as a matter of state or federal 
law, or both. To be sure, the federal Constitution unquestionably gives 
state legislatures the authority to engage in direct appointment of 
presidential electors. Moreover, it is also true that when exercising this 
federal constitutional authority there is no need for the state legislature to 
provide for gubernatorial involvement. 24 Thus, one might think that the 
two houses of the Pennsylvania legislature, without any legal obstacle, 
could supersede a popular vote with direct appointment of electors. While 
it might be undemocratic, it would not seem unlawful. 
But that conclusion would be too quick. While it is undoubtedly true 
that for future elections a state legislature could change the method of 
appointing presidential electors from a popular vote to direct 
appointment, there are at least two significant legal obstacles to consider 
with respect to an attempt by a state legislature to assert direct 
appointment authority after a popular vote to appoint electors has already 
taken place. 
First, insofar as this popular vote occurred pursuant to state legislation 
enacted using ordinary state legislative procedures, including 
presentment to the governor for possible veto, a strong argument can be 
made that this method of appointing electors cannot be undone except by 
a new state statute enacted using the same ordinary methods of 
legislation. In other words, even if the state legislature wants to return to 
a method of appointment with no gubernatorial involvement, the 
legislature first would need to repeal-by ordinary legislative methods­
the statute that authorized appointment by means of a popular vote. 
Second, the legislature would need to change in this appointment method 
before, not after, electors had already been appointed by means of a 
popular vote. The legislature is always free to make this move for next 
time, but it cannot-at least not without violating the due process clause 
of the Constitution-undo an appointment of electors already made.25 
24. In the early days to the Republic, when state legislatures choose to appoint electors directly, 
they debated whether to do so in joint sessions of both legislative chambers, or separate sessions, 
but they did not view this legislative appointment as requiring gubernatorial assent. See FOLEY, 
supra note I 8, at l 7. 
25. See Roe v. Alabama, 43 F.3d 574, 580-81 (11th Cir. 1995) (first quoting Yick Wo v. 
Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 370 (1886); and then quoting Curry v. Baker, 802 F.2d 1302, 13 I 5 (11th

320 Loyola University Chicago Law Journal [Vol. 51 
While these legal arguments are powerful, they ultimately may not 
matter. As we shall shortly see, what matters is whether or not Congress 
receives a submission of electoral votes from a state, not whether that 
submission is legally valid according to some standard that Congress 
might not recognize as binding. Thus, the two houses of Pennsylvania's 
legislature may not be legally entitled to negate popular appointment of . 
the state's presidential electors after that appointment has occurred. The 
legislature may require concurrence of the governor before any such 
move could be considered a valid rescission of the statute authorizing 
popular appointment. Even so, if the two houses of the state legislature 
purport to do this, and if the electors purportedly appointed meet and cast 
their electoral votes-and, most importantly, if these electors send their 
electoral votes to the President of the Senate-then the President of the 
Senate has these electoral votes in hand. That is enough for Congress to 
consider the votes and potentially accept those votes as the authoritative 
electoral votes from Pennsylvania. 
Also, it is worth noting that the strength of any argument against direct 
legislative appointment of presidential electors may depend heavily on 
the specific factual context in which such direct legislative appointment 
is attempted. In a genuine emergency, for example, it would not raise 
serious due process concerns for a state legislature to step in and appoint 
presidential electors directly when otherwise the state would risk losing 
its opportunity to participate in the presidential election altogether. 
Indeed, Congress itself has explicitly recognized that "the electors may 
be appointed on a subsequent day in such a manner as the legislature of 
such State may direct" if and when "any State has held an election for the 
purpose of choosing electors, and has failed to make a choice. "26 Thus, if 
there were a successful cyberattack on Pennsylvania's electoral 
infrastructure, thereby preventing the state from appointing presidential 
electors by means of a popular vote on Tuesday, November 3, there is 
precedent, as well as related rulings in the litigation, see EDWARD B. FOLEY, BALLOT BATTLES: 
THE HISTORY OF DISPUTED ELECTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES 267-77 (2016) [hereinafter 
BALLOT BATTLES]. More recently, the American Law Institute (ALI) has developed principles for 
the resolution of ballot-counting disputes that identifies this "due process" concern as a paramount 
principle that all elections should follow. Specifically, section 201 of these ALI principles provides: 
"Whenever the state's rules and procedures for the counting of ballot~ have been prescribed in 
advance of an election ... those rules and procedures shall be followed as prescribed, unless doing 
so would violate the U.S. Constitution or other federal law." The Reporters' Notes to Section 201 
provide additional analysis of the relationship of the Roe v. Alabama due process precedent to this 
basic principle. A.LI., PRINCIPLES OF THE LAW, ELECTION ADMINISTRATION: NON-PRECINCT

little doubt that the state's legislature could appoint electors directly as its 
chosen method for a backup method of appointment. 27 
In this particular circumstance, moreover, the governor would have no 
basis for standing in the way of this direct legislative appointment without 
any gubernatorial involvement; nor would due process pose any obstacle. 
Accordingly, as a matter of how persuasive a Trump effort at direct 
legislative appointment of electors would be, it might well depend on how 
successfully he could draw an analogy to a genuine emergency situation, 
like a cyberattack. If he were unable to convince anyone that the blue 
shift in the overtime count was anything other than the normal process of 
canvassing election returns, his argument for direct legislative 
appointment of electors would be correspondingly weak. Conversely, if 
he was able to convince at least his own Republican supporters that the 
blue shift was an electoral calamity comparable to a cyberattack, thereby 
nullifying the validity of the canvass and the overtime count, his 
argument that direct legislative appointment was necessary to fill the void 
left by the invalid blue shift would strengthen correspondingly at least in 
the eyes of his own supporters. 
In any event, this analysis will proceed on the assumption that Mike 
Pence, as President of the Senate, receives two sets of electoral votes from 
Pennsylvania: one reflecting the count of the canvass, certified by the 
governor; and the other reflecting the legislature's assertion of its 
authority to directly appoint the state's electors. 
II. FROM JANUARY 6, 2021, THROUGH JANUARY 20, 2021 
A. What Could Happen 
As January 6, 2021 approaches, the two parties take to cable news and 
social media to test various arguments as to why their candidate is the 
winner entitled to be inaugurated as president on January 20. Some 
Republicans take the especially aggressive position that Mike Pence, as 
President of the Senate, has the unilateral authority under the Twelfth 
Amendment to decide which certificate of electoral votes from 
Pennsylvania is the authoritative one entitled to be counted in Congress 
and that he, accordingly, will count the certificate from the electors 
appointed by the state legislature because the Constitution authorizes the 
state legislature to choose the method of appointing electors. 
These Republicans point to the historical pedigree of this position, 
observing that Republicans made the same argument during the disputed 
27. See id. ("Whenever any State has held an election for the purpose of choosing electors, 
and has failed to make a choice on the day prescribed by law, the electors may be appointed on a 
subsequent day in such a manner as the legislature of such State may direct.").  VP-R0000183_0014 
(2021-079) 
322 Loyola University Chicago Law Journal [Vol. 51 
election of 1876 and that at least some recent law journal scholarship has 
supported this position.28 Unembarrassed by the apparent conflict of 
interest caused by Mike Pence simultaneously being a candidate for 
reelection and arbiter of the electoral dispute, these Republicans observe 
that Thomas Jefferson was in essentially the same position during the 
disputed election of 1800 and yet the Twelfth Amendment left this 
provision in place when Congress rewrote the procedures for the 
Electoral College afterwards. While it is true that an incumbent Vice­
President might have a direct personal stake in the electoral dispute to be 
resolved, the Republicans argue, at least the glare of the spotlight is 
focused on whatever the vice president does in this situation, and 
everyone will be able to judge whether the vice president acted honorably 
or dishonorably in resolving the dispute. 
Other Republicans offer an alternative argument, which would still_ 
lead to Trump's reelection. They contend that, under the proper 
interpretation of the operative federal statute-the Electoral Count Act of 
1887-Pennsylvania's electoral votes must be discarded because both 
conflicting submissions of electoral votes from the state purport to be 
timely and authoritative under state law.29 Because neither submission 
has inherently higher status from a federal vantage point, according to 
this alternative argument, both submissions in effect cancel each other 
out, and there are no electoral votes from Pennsylvania to be counted. 
Moreover, this argument continues, Pennsylvania's failure to appoint 
electors in a manner capable of recognition by Congress alters the 
arithmetic for determining which candidate won an Electoral College 
majority. Because Pennsylvania did not validly appoint any electors, only 
a total of 518 electors were appointed (the usual 538 minus 
Pennsylvania's 20). Trump won an undisputed 260 Electoral College 
votes apart from the controversy over Pennsylvania. Because 260 is a 
bare majority of 518, these Republicans contend that Trump has secured 
"a majority of the whole number of electors appointed," within the 
meaning of the Twelfth Amendment, and thus must be recognized as the 
duly elected president for a second term. 
Democrats will have none of this. They contend that the constitutional 
argument that would give Mike Pence the power to declare himself and 
Trump reelected is preposterous and that, to the contrary, Congress has 
the authority to enact a law to govern the resolution of a dispute over the 
proper electoral votes from a state. The Electoral Count Act of 1887 is 
28. Vasan Kesavan, Is the Electoral Count Act Uncunstitutional?, 80 N.C. L. REV. 1653, 1688---
90, 1699-1701 (2002).

(2021-079) 
2019) Preparing for a Disputed Presidential Election 323 
that law, they argue. They further contend that, properly interpreted, the 
statute requires the certificate bearing the governor's signature to be 
accepted by Congress as authoritative.30 Even if one chamber of 
Congress wishes to repudiate the validity of that gubernatorial certificate, 
the Electoral Count Act requires its votes for Warren to be counted as 
long as one house of Congress considers it valid. 31 The Democrats 
observe that Speaker Nancy Pelosi already has made clear that on 
January 6 a majority in the House of Representatives will vote to accept 
electoral votes from Pennsylvania as certified by the state's governor and 
thus America should be preparing for the inauguration of Elizabeth 
Warren as its next president on January 20. 
As a fallback position, other Democrats argue that if the dispute over 
Pennsylvania remains unresolved on January 20, then no candidate shall 
have been "qualified" for either president or vice-president within the 
meaning of the Twentieth Amendment. Therefore, they argue, under the 
succession statute enacted by Congress, Nancy Pelosi, upon resignation 
as Speaker, is to serve as acting president until such time as the dispute is 
resolved and a president shall have "qualified" as recognized by 
Congress. While Pelosi herself has made abundantly plain her preference 
that Warren be recognized and inaugurated as the duly elected president, 
she is prepared to assume the responsibilities of acting president for as 
long as necessary, which is for as long as Republicans refuse to 
acknowledge the lawfulness and legitimacy of Warren's election. Since 
Republicans cannot prevail in this contest, these Democrats argue, they 
should acquiesce in Warren's election and thus avoid the extra 
complications associated with Pelosi operating as an Acting President. 
Republicans, in tum, scoff at these arguments made by Democrats. 
They continue to claim that Trump is the one duly elected. They and 
Trump himself assert that the country must move forward toward the 
inauguration of Trump's second term on January 20. 
B. Analysis 
The procedures for handling a disputed presidential election that 
reaches Congress are regrettably, and embarrassingly, deficient. The 
country was spared the agony of having to suffer the invocation of these 
procedures in 2000. The dispute over that year's presidential election did 
not last all the way to Congress. Instead, Al Gore refused to carry that 
dispute forward--despite the contrary urging of his advisers, including 
30. For further details of this statutory analysis, see infra pp. 351-61.

Ron Klain-after the United States Supreme Court ruled against him in 
Bush v. Gore-32 
There is absolutely no guarantee, however, that a disputed presidential 
election in 2020 would not reach Congress. Indeed, as explained above, 
the analysis here is premised on the assumption that Trump easily could 
take a dispute over an outcome-determinative blue shift in the overtime 
count all the way to Congress. Trump could do so by having the state 
legislature send a second certificate of electoral vote, ones supporting 
him, to "compete" in Congress against a conflicting certificate of 
electoral votes from the same state, these other ones supporting his 
Democratic opponent based on the blue shift count in overtime. Thus, as 
part of an effort to prepare for the risk of a disputed presidential election 
in 2020, it is imperative to consider how the embarrassingly deficient 
procedures might operate if they were actually called into play. 
The Constitution itself says remarkably little relevant to this topic, and 
what it does say is shockingly ambiguous. Here is the applicable text of 
the Twelfth Amendment: 
[T]he President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and 
House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall 
then be counted;-
The person having the greatest number of votes for President, shall be 
the President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of 
electors appointed; and if no person have such majority, then from the 
persons having the highest numbers not exceeding three on the list of 
those voted for as President, the House of Representatives shall choose 
immediately, by ballot, the President-33 
The first thing to observe about this constitutional language is that the 
critical sentence is written in the passive voice: "the votes shall then be 
counted." Here, thus, is the first :frustrating ambiguity. It could be the 
"President of the Senate" who does the counting; or, after the President 
of the Senate has finished the role of "open[ing] the certificates" then the 
whole Congress, in this special joint session, collectively counts the 
electoral votes. 
Either way, this language contains no provision for what to do in the 
event of a dispute, whether with respect to the "certificates" to be 
"open(ed]" or with respect to the "votes" contained therein. It certainly 
says nothing about what to do if the President of the Senate has received 
two conflicting certificates of electoral votes from the same state, each 
32. See generally Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98 (2000) (per curiam); see also id. at 110 ("Because 
it is evident that any recount ... will be unconstitutional ... we reverse the judgement of the 
Supreme Court of Florida ordering a recount to proceed.").

certificate purporting to come from the state's authoritatively appointed 
electors. As the distinguished jurist Joseph Story observed early in the 
nineteenth century, this crucial constitutional language in the Twelfth 
Amendment appears to have been written without imaging that it might 
ever be possible for this sort of dispute to arise.34 
Despite its ambiguity, or perhaps because of it, the peculiar passive­
voice phrasing of this crucial sentence opens up the possibility of 
interpreting it to provide that the "President of the Senate" has the 
exclusive constitutional authority to determine which "certificates" to 
"open" and thus which electoral votes "to be counted." This interpretation 
can derive support from the observation that the President of the Senate 
is the only officer, or instrumentality, of government given an active role 
in the process of opening the certificates and counting the electoral votes 
from the states. The Senate and House of Representatives, on this view, 
have an observational role only. The opening and counting are conducted 
in their "presence"-for the sake of transparency-but these two 
legislative bodies do not actually take any actions of their own in this 
opening and counting process. How could they? Under the Constitution, 
the Senate and the House of Representatives only act separately, as 
entirely distinct legislative chambers. They have no constitutional way to 
act together as one amalgamated corpus. Thus, they can only watch as the 
President of the Senate opens the certificates of electoral votes from the 
states and announces the count of the electoral votes contained therein. 
This interpretation of the Twelfth Amendment is bolstered, moreover, 
by the further observation that the responsibility to definitively decide 
which electoral votes from each state are entitled to be counted must be 
lodged ultimately in some singular authority of the federal government. 
If one body could decide the question one way, while another body could 
reach the opposite conclusion, then there inevitably is a stalemate unless 
and until a single authority is identified with the power to settle the matter 
once and for all. Given the language of the Twelfth Amendment, 
whatever its ambiguity and potential policy objections, there is no other 
possible single authority to identify for this purpose besides the President 
of the Senate. 
This role could have been vested in the chief justice of the United 
States, as is the constitutional authority to preside over the trial of an 
impeachment of the president. Or disputes of this nature could have been 
referred directly to the Supreme Court, as a singular corporate body, for 
defmitive resolution there. But the Constitution does neither; nor does it 
make any other such provision. Thus, according to this argument, the 
34. See BALLOT BATTLES, supra note 25, at 72 ("It seems to have been taken for granted that 
no question could ever arise on the subject.") ( citations omitted).  VP-R0000183_0018 
(2021-079) 
326 Loyola University Chicago Law Journal [Vol. 51 
inevitable implication of the Twelfth Amendment's text is that it vests 
this ultimate singular authority, for better or worse, in the President of the 
Senate. Subject only to the joint observational role of the Senate and 
House of Representatives, the President of the Senate decides 
authoritatively what "certificates" from the states to "open" and thus what 
electoral votes are "to be counted." 
Whatever each of us personally thinks of this interpretative argument, 
it is necessary to acknowledge that it has a significant historical 
pedigree.35 It routinely had its advocates in the years leading up to the 
disputed election of 1876. During that intense dispute, it was 
conveniently invoked by Republicans, since the President of the Senate 
was one of their own at the time.36 After the resolution of that ugly 
dispute, the argument was resurrected by some during the congressional 
debates that led to passage of the Electoral Count Act of 1887, including 
the claim that this Act is unconstitutional because it interferes with the 
exclusive authority vested in the President of the Senate to determine 
which electoral votes from the states to count. That claim was repeated 
after passage of this Act.37 Indeed, it has been repeated recently-and 
forcefully-in a law review article written after Bush v. Gore in 
contemplation of what might transpire if and when another disputed 
presidential election ever reaches Congress. 38 Trump and his supporters 
would almost certainly invoke this argument if and when it was to his 
advantage to do so. 
For as long as this argument has been made, however, it has had its 
vociferous detractors. The Necessary and Proper Clause, the 
counterargument goes, gives Congress ample legislative authority to fill 
the gaps and clarify the ambiguities that exist in the text of the Twelfth 
Amendment itself.39 It would be unseemly ( or worse) to leave the 
exclusive power to resolve disputes over the electoral votes of a state in 
the hands of the Senate president--especially when the Senate president 
is one of the candidates directly involved in the dispute, as has been the 
case multiple times, including Gore in 2000 and Nixon in 1960. Thus, it 
should be clear that Congress may invoke its Necessary and Proper 
Clause power to enact a statute that provides for an alternative 
mechanism for resolving a dispute over the electoral votes from a state.

2019] Preparing for a Disputed Presidential Election 327 
According to this counterargument, the Electoral Count Act of 1887, as 
imperfect as it may be as a policy and legislative drafting matter, is an 
entirely appropriate exercise of this Necessary and Proper power as a 
matter of constitutional authority. Thus, there can be no constitutional 
objection to the procedures set forth in this Act on the ground that they 
deprive the Senate President of what otherwise would be exclusive 
authority to resolve this kind of dispute. 
It is fair to say that this counterargument, on behalf of congressional 
power under the Necessary and Proper Clause, has had more adherents 
throughout history than the argument on behalf of exclusive 
constitutional power lodged in the President of the Senate. We shall 
momentarily tum to the Electoral Count Act of 1887 as an exercise of this 
Necessary and Proper Clause power, on the assumption that it is 
constitutionally valid no matter its statutory deficiencies. Nonetheless, it 
must be recognized that the argument on behalf of exclusive Senate 
President authority has never been thoroughly vanquished. How could it 
be unless and until there is a new constitutional amendment superseding 
the ambiguity of the Twelfth Amendment on this point? Thus, one must 
prepare for the possibility that this constitutional debate will recur, if and 
when the outcome of a presidential election potentially turns on which 
side of the argument prevails. 
Before turning to the statute, there is another constitutional provision 
to consider. The Twentieth Amendment provides: 
If a President shall not have been chosen before the time fixed for the 
beginning of his term, or if the President elect shall have failed to 
qualify, then the Vice President elect shall act as President until a 
President shall have qualified; and the Congress may by law provide for 
the case wherein neither a President elect nor a Vice President elect 
shall have qualified, declaring who shall then act as President, or the 
manner in which one who is to act shall be selected, and such person 
shall act accordingly until a President or Vice President shall have 
qualified. 40 
This provision contemplates the possibility that the time for 
inaugurating the new president-at noon, on January 20--may arrive 
without a new president having yet "been chosen." The most 
straightforward textual way this might occur is if it is abundantly clear to 
all that no candidate has received a majority of electoral votes. In that 
event, under the Twelfth Amendment the House of Representatives is 
supposed to elect a president by means of a special procedure in which 
each state's delegation to the House has one vote. But the Twelfth 
Amendment provides that an absolute majority of all states "shall be 
40. U.S. CONST. amend. XII.  VP-R0000183_0020 
(2021-079) 
328 Loyola University Chicago Law Journal [Vol. 51 
necessary to a choice" and thus it is possible that the House will have 
failed to achieve this choice by the required majority vote before noon 
arrives on January 20. In this case, if the Senate has successfully 
exercised its parallel authority under the Twelfth Amendment to elect a 
new vice president (when no vice presidential candidate received an 
Electoral College majority), then this provision of the Twentieth 
Amendment makes clear that the vice president newly elected by the 
Senate under the Twelfth Amendment becomes "acting president" until 
such time as the House of Representatives manages to elect a president 
by the required majority vote. 
But what if the Senate has also failed to perform its function under the 
Twelfth Amendment and has not yet elected a vice president? In this case, 
it would seem that the Twentieth Amendment invokes the statutory line 
of succession that Congress has the power to adopt-although the 
Amendment does so somewhat ambiguously by switching to the word 
"qualified" from the previously used "chosen": "the Congress may by 
law provide for the case wherein neither a President elect nor a Vice 
President elect shall have qualified."41 Presumably, then, if all agree that 
no new president or vice president has yet been elected under the Twelfth 
Amendment by the time noon on January 20 arrives, then"[t]he Speaker 
of the House of Representatives shall, upon his resignation as Speaker 
and as Representative in Congress, act as President." 42 Assuming that 
Nancy Pelosi is reelected Speaker on January 3, 2021, then she would be 
in the position to become acting president if no new president or vice 
president has been elected by noon on January 20. 
But what if it is disputed whether or not a new president has been­
"elected," "chosen," or "qualified" within the meaning of the Twentieth 
Amendment? Suppose Republicans claim that President Trump has been 
reelected, while at the same time Democrats argue that either Warren has 
been elected or, if not, then no one has (at least not yet). Thus, according 
to the Democrats, under the Twentieth Amendment it devolves to Nancy 
Pelosi, upon resignation as Speaker and from the House, to act as 
president. 43 The Twentieth Amendment does not seem to speak

Unconstitutional?, 48 STAN. L. REV. 113 (1995). Even if that argument is sound with respect to the 
circumstance of a presidential death (in the middle of the president's term), it would seem 
inapplicable with respect to the operation of the Twentieth Amendment, which does not limit whom 
Congress may choose to act as President in the event of no "qualified" President-elect and Vice 
President-elect.

specifically to this circumstance. It seems to assume that either it is clear 
that there is a new president-elect to be inaugurated at noon on January 
20, or it is clear that there is not (and equally clear that there is no new 
vice president), in which case the need for an acting president is 
unambiguously triggered. The Twentieth Amendment does not seem to 
contemplate that it might be unclear, and thus disputed, whether there is 
a newly elected president to be inaugurated or, instead, whether an acting 
president is required for the time being. 
How might this particular kind of ambiguity or dispute arise? For that, 
we tum to the astonishingly messy language of the Electoral Count Act 
of 1887.44 
1. The Electoral Count Act 
The key section of the Act is codified as 3 U.S.C. § 15. This section is 
itself a monstrosity, amounting to a virtually impenetrable maze of 807 
words. It starts innocuously enough, requiring the opening and counting 
of electoral votes from the states-as required by the Twelfth 
Amendment-to commence at 1 :00 p.m. on January 6, with both the 
Senate and the House of Representatives present in "the Hall of the House 
of Representatives" and the President of the Senate serving as "their 
presiding officer. "45 The section then provides that the opening and 
counting of each state's electoral votes will proceed state-by-state in 
alphabetical order. If there is only one submission of electoral votes from 
a state, the operation of the statute is acceptably straightforward and 
comprehensible: this submission must count according to electoral votes 
contained therein unless both houses of Congress, acting separately, 
agree to reject those electoral votes.46 
The section's interpretative difficulties arise only if there are two or 
more conflicting submissions of electoral votes from the same state. To 
be sure, there is no difficulty under the section if both chambers of 
Congress agree to accept the same submission as the authoritative one 
would be disputing this as well, arguing instead that either Warren's running mate had been elected 
or that there was no new vice president yet, thereby requiring the responsibility of acting president 
to devolve upon Nancy Pelosi. 
44. See BALLOT BATTLES, supra note 25, at 150-77 (analyzing the statute's genesis and 
legislative history). 
45. 3 u.s.c. § 15 (2018). 
46. This is why Trump cannot prevail if there is only one submission of electoral votes from 
Pennsylvania, and those are for Warren-as long as the Democrats retain control of the House 
(since it will be the new House sworn in on January 3, 2021). Only by Pence, as still President of 
the Senate on January 6, willing to declare the clear operation of the Electoral Count Act, 3 U.S.C. 
§ 15, entirely irrelevant in this situation, could Pennsylvania's electoral votes not count for Warren 
in this situation. But, as indicated earlier, that seems so far-fetched to beyond the stretch of 
imagination.  VP-R0000183_0022

containing the valid votes to be counted. As one portion of this section 
puts it, "those votes, and those only, shall be counted which the two 
Houses shall concurrently decide were cast by lawful electors appointed 
in accordance with the laws of the State."47 
Thus, in the 2020 scenario we are contemplating-where the President 
of the Senate has received two submissions from Pennsylvania, one with 
the governor's certificate and the other based on the purported legislative 
appointment-if both the Senate and the House accepted the electoral 
votes bearing the governor's certificate as the proper ones (because they 
were cast by electors duly appointed pursuant to an accurate count of the 
state's popular vote according to the canvassing and other electoral laws 
of the state), the controversy would end in terms of what the statute 
provides. True enough, as a political matter, the fight may remain 
unsettled depending on exactly the nature of the Senate's vote. If only a 
few renegade Republicans-like Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski­
joined all the Democrats to concur with the acceptance of the Warren 
electoral votes from Pennsylvania, thereby agreeing with the Pelosi-led 
vote in the House to do the same, Mike Pence might be tempted to assert 
a constitutional prerogative to supersede the provisions of the Electoral 
Count Act and, despite this joint agreement of the two congressional 
chambers, declare the legislatively appointed electors to be the 
authoritative ones from Pennsylvania. 48 But if Mitch McConnell leads 
the Republican-controlled Senate to agree with the Democratic­
controlled House that the governor-certified electoral votes from 
Pennsylvania are the valid ones, it would seem impossible as a practical 
matter for Pence to prevail on his constitutional claim that he is entitled 
to overrule this bicameral (and bipartisan) determination of which 
electoral votes from Pennsylvania to count. For this reason, it makes all 
the difference in the world how Mitch McConnell chooses to lead the 
Republican conference in the Senate if this kind of situation occurs. 
But what if the Senate and House disagree? What if, in other words, 
the Pelosi-led House votes to accept the electoral votes for Warren, while 
simultaneously the McConnell-led Senate votes to accept the electoral 
votes for Trump? Here is where the statutory morass of 3 U.S.C. § 15 
becomes an interpretative quagmire. As scholars have recognized ever 
47. 3 u.s.c. § 15. 
48. The political tenability of a fight in this circumstance might depend on the mood of the 
country. If Trump's so-called "base" voters are relatively acquiescent in the outcome, then it would 
seem politically infeasible for Pence to override the judgment of both the House and the Senate 
even if the Senate's vote (like the House's) is mostly made up of Democrats. But if the Republican 
base is especially agitated, then it might embolden Pence to try to make this kind of move, knowing 
that he would have the support of Mitch McConnell and other Republican leaders-although he 
would lack the support of the Senate institutionally.  VP-R0000183_0023

2019] Preparing for a Disputed Presidential Election 331 
since the adoption of the Electoral Count Act in 1887, its opaque and 
contorted text is susceptible to two different understandings of what is 
supposed to happen in this inherently fraught situation-a circumstance 
for which statutory clarity, rather than ambiguity, is acutely required. 49 
This point is not to say that the two alternative interpretations are equally 
valid, or would appear so to a disinterested tribunal endeavoring to be 
genuinely nonpartisan in resolving a dispute of this kind. It is only to say 
that the two alternative interpretations are at least superficially tenable, 
with advocates for each among scholars and in the historical record. Thus, 
in an actual dispute either side would be able to invoke one of these 
alternative interpretations to support its position in the particular 
controversy at hand. 
We can easily see how Democrats could forcefully apply this point and 
argue that, once the Senate and House have diverged on which 
submission of electoral votes from Pennsylvania should be counted, the 
operation of 3 U.S.C. § 15 requires that the submission bearing the 
governor's certificate is the one that must be accepted. The Democrats 
would quote this sentence in the statute: "But if the two Houses shall 
disagree in respect of the counting of such votes, then, and in that case, 
the votes of the electors whose appointment shall have been certified by 
the executive of the State, under the seal thereof, shall be counted." The 
Democrats would also cite a comprehensive post-2000 law review article, 
The Conscientious Congressman's Guide to the Electoral Count Act of 
1887, which makes the case for counting the electoral votes in the 
submission from the state that bears the governor's signature is the 
correct reading of the statute.so 
It is harder, but not impossible, to make the counterargument that the 
proper reading of the statute as applied to this specific situation requires 
the rejection of both submissions of electoral votes from Pennsylvania. 
This counterargument takes the position that a gubernatorial certificate 
does not act as a tiebreaker when two ( or more) certificates of submission 
of electoral votes from the same state claim "safe harbor" status under 
another section of the Electoral Count Act of 1887.51 Those who 
followed, or have studied, the saga of the 2000 presidential election will 
remember this statutory section described as the "safe harbor provision." 
This section purports to bind Congress when a state has settled a dispute 
over its own electoral votes by a specified deadline-six days before the 
scheduled meeting of the electors-and according to rules existing in 
49. See generally A.L.1., supra note 25 (identifying this "due process" concern as one that 
should be of utmost importance in all elections).

state law prior to the day for appointing electors by means of a popular 
vote in the state. Several scholars, including one from the Congressional 
Research Service, assert that when multiple submission of electoral votes 
from the same state all claim "safe harbor" protection, none can be 
counted-not even one bearing a gubernatorial certificate-unless both 
houses of Congress agree upon which submission is entitled to this "safe 
harbor" status.5 2 These scholars quote a separate portion of the 
impenetrable text of 3 U.S.C. § 15: 
[I]n case there shall arise the question which of two or more of such 
State authorities determining what electors have been appointed, as 
mentioned in section 5 of this title, is the lawful tribunal of such State, 
the votes regularly given of those electors, and those only, of such State 
shall be counted whose title as electors the two Houses, acting 
separately, shall concurrently decide is supported by the decision of 
such State so authorized by its law .... 
This language, these scholars contend, means that both Houses must 
agree to count electoral votes claiming safe-harbor status when other 
electoral votes from the same state are also making the same safe-harbor 
claim. In support of their contention that the electoral votes bearing the 
governor's signature cannot be counted in this situation, as long as one 
chamber of Congress objects, these scholars offer this reasoning: 
If the Houses cannot agree on the authoritative determination ... no 
vote from the state in question is counted. This result follows regardless 
of the governor's action. Congress in this case looks to the executive 
certificate only as evidence of the decision reached by a tribunal 
authorized by the state legislature. If the decision of the authorized 
tribunal cannot be made out, then there is no valid return for the 
governor to certify.53 
This interpretation of the statutory language may not be especially 
convincing; readers can judge for themselves. The important point is that 
that this interpretative reasoning exists, both in law review literature and 
Congressional Research Service analysis. It is available to be championed 
when doing so serves a partisan purpose. It cannot be dismissed as 
nonexistent, however much one might wish that to be the case. 
In the context of the specific scenario under consideration, one can see 
how the electoral votes bearing the governor's signature would claim 
safe-harbor status. This would be especially true if the Pennsylvania 
Supreme Court affirmed them as the lawful electoral votes of the state 
and did so in a decision issued at least six days before Monday, December

14. As part of this safe-harbor claim, the state supreme court would assert 
that it was acting pursuant to statutory authority adopted prior to Tuesday, 
November 3, the day for appointing the state's electors by means of a 
popular vote. 
It is more difficult to see how an argument for safe-harbor status could 
be made for the electoral votes cast by the electors purportedly appointed 
by the state legislature directly, sometime after Tuesday, November 3, in 
response to the blue shift. It would seem that this kind of retroactive 
legislative move is precisely the kind of change in law that is not 
supposed to receive safe-harbor status. 
And, yet, it is not entirely impossible to make the contrary argument, 
especially if the state legislature acts to make its direct appointment of 
electors before the safe-harbor deadline of six days before Monday, 
December 14. This argument would depend, again, on the claim that the 
state legislature was responding to an emergency analogous to a 
cyberattack. Surely, if there were a cyberattack-this argument would 
go--a direct legislative appointment of electors would be entitled to safe­
harbor status if made within the requisite deadline, in order to avoid 
depriving the state of an opportunity to participate in the presidential 
election. This direct legislative appointment would occur pursuant to 
residual emergency authority that existed in state law prior to Tuesday, 
November 3. There is always such residual legislative authority in the 
context of a genuine emergency, this argument might add. Because the 
state legislature viewed the blue shift during the canvass as a theft of the 
popular will of the state, comparable to a cyberattack and thus an 
equivalent emergency, the direct legislative appointment of electors is 
entitled to safe harbor status in the one emergency situation as much as 
the other. 
This argument might not seem especially strong, but it is enough to 
claim that under 3 U.S.C. § 15 neither of Pennsylvania's electoral vote 
submissions may be counted when the House has voted to count one and 
the Senate has voted to count the other. Because it is an argument that in 
this context supports Trump's claim to reelection, one would expect 
Republicans to make it in the run-up to January 6. The argument depends 
on the further proposition that, once it is determined that Pennsylvania 
has failed to appoint any electors capable of being recognized as 
authoritative by Congress, then Trump has a majority of votes from all 
electors authoritatively appointed: 260 of 518. One would thus expect 
Republicans to make that claim as well.54 Thus, January 6 approaches in 
54. This issue is also debatable, as has been recognized at least since the congressional debates 
on the Electoral Count Act. See BALLOT BATTLES, supra note 25, at 150---77 (discussing the  VP-R0000183_0026 
(2021-079) 
334 Loyola University Chicago Law Journal [Vol. 51 
this hypothetical scenario, the speculative chatter on cable and Twitter is 
that if the House and Senate divide over which electoral votes from 
Pennsylvania to accept, then Mike Pence as President of the Senate will 
proclaim that neither counts and will use that proclamation as the basis 
for declaring Trump re-elected by a majority of electors appointed. 
Anticipating this move, Democrats in turn explore ways to prevent it. 
They argue that if the House refuses to continue participating in the 
procedure specified in 3 U.S.C. § 15 after Pence makes this erroneous 
and unlawful proclamation regarding Pennsylvania, then the opening of 
certificates and the counting of electoral votes from all remaining states 
cannot continue. They quote the very last sentence of 3 U.S.C. § 15: "No 
votes or papers from any other State shall be acted upon until the 
objections previously made to the votes or papers from any State shall 
have been finally disposed of."55 With the process stuck at Pennsylvania, 
and the count incomplete, there is no president-elect, the Democrats 
argue. Nor is there a vice president-elect. This means, they say, Nancy 
Pelosi is entitled to serve as acting president for as long as the stalemate 
remains, by virtue of the Twentieth Amendment. 
Nonsense, Republicans retort. Democrats cannot trigger the Twentieth 
Amendment simply by walking out of the procedure for counting 
electoral votes under 3 U.S.C. § 15, these Republicans respond. They 
point to the very next section of the statute: "Such joint meeting shall not 
be dissolved until the count of electoral votes shall be completed and the 
result declared."56 Mike Pence, as President of the Senate, therefore can 
legislative history of the Electoral Count Act). The other side of this argument is that the 
denominator does not change, despite a state's failure to appoint electors able to be recognized as 
authoritative by Congress. The Constitution itself does not directly speak to this point, and the 
Electoral Count Act did not attempt to resolve this debate. Richard Posner addressed this issue in 
his book on Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98 (2000) (per curiam), arguing that it was one of many reasons 
that justified the Court's involvement in that disputed election. See generally RICHARD A. POSNER, 
BREAKING THE DEADLOCK: THE 2000 ELECTION, THE CONSTITUTION, AND THE COURTS (2001). 
Note: if the denominator-does-not-change side of the debate were to prevail, it would mean that no 
candidate receives a majority of electoral votes, and the election goes to the House of 
Representatives pursuant to the special one-vote-per-state procedure.

simply resume the process, with the next state (Rhode Island) and proceed 
to the end (Wyoming) even if the only members of the House and Senate 
remaining to watch are Republicans. In this way, the process of counting 
electoral votes under 3 U.S.C. § 15 could end with this basic dispute still 
remaining. Republicans would claim that Trump has been reelected, by 
virtue of Mike Pence's assertion to this effect pursuant to his 
understanding of § 15 as the presiding officer of its proceeding. 
Meanwhile Democrats would claim that the counting of electoral votes 
remains incomplete because of the attempted usurpation of authority by 
Pence in refusing to count the electoral votes from Pennsylvania bearing 
the governor's certificate, as required by the proper interpretation and 
operation of 3 U.S.C. § 15.57 
Which position is correct under the Twentieth Amendment? Who 
decides, and how? If the election remains unsettled at this stage, what 
then? 
III. JANUARY 6, 2021, THROUGH JANUARY 20, 2021 
A. What Could Happen 
At 1:00 p.m. on January 6, 2021, pursuant to 3 U.S.C. § 15 and the 
Twelfth Amendment, the Senate and House of Representatives gather in 
the House chamber for the counting of electoral votes of the states. Mike 
Pence presides in his role as President of the Senate, as specified by both 
the statute and the Constitution. Starting with Alabama, and continuing 
alphabetically, the counting proceeds smoothly until Pennsylvania. Pence 
announces that he is in receipt of two submissions purporting to be the 
state's electoral votes and under 3 U.S.C. § 15 he must submit both to the 
Senate and House for their separate consideration. The Senate then 
withdraws from the House chamber and, as expected, votes to accept the 
submission of electoral votes from the electors appointed by the state's 
legislature, while simultaneously the House votes to accept the 
submission certified by the state's governor. 
When the Senate returns to the House chamber for the resumption of 
the joint session, Pence announces that because neither submission has 
57. In this posture, the Democrats analytically would be making two distinct arguments, one 
statutory and the other constitutional. Their statutory argument would come first, and it would be 
that the proper interpretation of 3 U.S.C. § 15 requires the Senate President to recognize the 
Pennsylvania submission bearing the governor's signature as legally authoritative. If the Senate 
President errs in this statutory respect, then the Democrats would turn to their constitutional 
argument as a secondary line-of-defense: namely, under the Twelfth and Twentieth Amendments, 
properly interpreted in tandem, the electoral count cannot be complete without the institutional 
participation of the House; thus, if the House refuses to acquiesce in the process, it is an "Acting 
President" situation under the Twentieth Amendment.  VP-R0000183_0028

336 Loyola University Chicago Law Journal [Vol. 51 
been accepted as authoritative by both houses of Congress, neither 
submission's electoral votes can be counted. At this there are howls of 
protests by Democrats in the chamber, who clamor their insistence that 
the electoral votes bearing the governor's certificate must be counted 
under the express terms of3 U.S.C. § 15.58 After much commotion, Pence 
manages to gavel the proceedings to order and repeats that his 
understanding of§ 15, contrary to the views expressed by the Democrats, 
is that neither submission of electoral votes from Pennsylvania can be 
counted because of the split votes of the two congressional chambers. 
That is his ruling as presiding officer, and he is prepared to move on to 
the next state, Rhode Island. 
The Democrats erupt in protest again and demand an opportunity to 
overrule Pence's patently erroneous interpretation of§ 15. Pence again 
gavels the proceeding to order and announces that there is no method 
under 3 U.S.C. § 15, or the Twelfth Amendment, to overrule his rulings 
and announcements as presiding officer. The Senate and House do not act 
jointly as a unified combined body.59 Under both 3 U.S.C. § 15 and the 
Twelfth Amendment, their joint role is solely as observers of the process. 
Each chamber has made its separate determination regarding 
Pennsylvania, and accordingly it is his role-Pence asserts-to announce 
the consequence of those separate determination. Based on his 
understanding of both the statute and the Constitution, and as advised by 
counsel, he had performed this necessary function, declaring both 
submissions from Pennsylvania ineligible to be counted, and now under 
the statute and Constitution he must move the proceedings on to the next 
state. 
Then, Nancy Pelosi rises, demanding to speak. (Under 3 U.S.C. § 16, 
she sits "immediately upon [the Senate president's] left."). She 
announces that the joint meeting of two chambers is over, or at least 
suspended, unless and until Mike Pence is prepared to change his ruling 
and accept the electoral votes from Pennsylvania bearing the governor's 
signature. Absent that, the Senators are no longer welcome in the House 
chamber. When Pence insists that Pelosi has no authority to suspend the 
proceedings in this way, Pelosi declares that she will call upon the 
sergeant-at-arms of the House of Representatives to forcibly remove the 
senators from the House chamber unless the senators leave voluntarily. 
In order to avoid that spectacle, and in the hope that Republicans will

117-----49 (discussing the dispute over the process of counting electoral votes in the 1876 election).

no question shall be put by the presiding officer except to either House on a motion to withdraw.").  VP-R0000183_0029

2019] Preparing for a Disputed Presidential Election 337 
eventually triumph after cooler heads prevail, Pence reluctantly agrees to 
lead the Senators out of the House chamber.60 
With the House now alone in its own chamber, and Speaker Pelosi 
presiding, the House (in a party-line vote) passes a resolution stating that 
the joint proceeding under the Twelfth Amendment and 3 U.S.C. § 15 is 
hereby suspended unless and until Vice President Pence publicly 
announces that he is prepared to count the electoral votes from 
Pennsylvania as certified by the governor. Until then the House has 
ordered its sergeant-at-arms to bar the reappearance of Pence or any other 
Senator in the House chamber. Pelosi, however, does not go so far as to 
bar Republican members of the House from leaving the chamber, and 
they do.61 
With Pelosi and the Democrats refusing to budge, Pence and the 
Republicans decide they need to do what they can to continue the 
counting of electoral votes, even if they cannot return to the House 
chamber. Consequently, Pence invites senators and representatives to 
crowd into the Senate's chamber for this purpose. Only Republican 
senators and representatives show up, except for one designated 
Democratic Senator to protest the purported continuation of the 
proceedings as unlawful under 3 U.S.C. § 15 and the Twelfth 
Amendment. 
Among other objections, this Democratic senator points out that 
3 U.S.C. § 15 specifically requires that there be two "tellers" from each 
60. Id § 17 contemplates the possibility of the House demanding a "recess" of the electoral 
count proceedings on January 6, based on an objection to how the process is being handled: "no 
recess shall be taken unless a question shall have arisen in regard to counting any such votes." Thus, 
although "the President of the Senate shall have power to preserve order" during the joint session 
itself, see 3 U.S.C. § 18, the Senate President cannot insist that no such "recess" occur, if the House 
has raised a question "in regard to counting any such votes." Consequently, Speaker Pelosi would 
be within her rights to insist upon suspension of the joint session, at least for a short period in which 
the House may wish to deliberate or "recess" while it determines its institutional position as a 
legislative chamber regarding the situation. In any event, if the House Speaker orders the House 
Sergeant-at-Arms to clear the House chamber, it would seem evident that the Sergeant-at-Arms 
would obey this direct order from the head of the House, rather than taking any contrary direction 
from the Senate President, whose presence in that chamber is at the invitation of the House. See 
also BALLOT BATTLES, supra note 25, at 142 (discussing a historical example of the House Speaker 
invoking the House Sergeant-at-Arms, although not during the deliberations of the joint session 
itself). 
61 . As against the argument that the Electoral Count Act precludes this kind of unilateral 
withdrawal from the counting process by the House, Speaker Pelosi asserts the House's inherent 
constitutional authority to govern its own conduct. In support of this argument, Speaker Pelosi can 
quote a recent law review article: "This plenary authority requires that the House and Senate be 
free to debate, make motions, and withdraw from the count at any time as they wish, the [Electoral 
Count Act] notwithstanding, subject, of course, to motions passing by the requisite majority of that 
house." Chris Land & David Schultz, On the Unenforceability of the Electoral Count Act, 13

chamber to participate in the opening and counting of electoral votes from 
the states: "said tellers, having then read the [the submission of electoral 
votes from the states] in the presence and hearing of the two Houses, shall 
make a list of the votes as they shall appear from the said certificates." 62 
Because the House of Representatives is no longer participating, as 
declared in its formal resolution, there no longer are two tellers from the 
House to perform this statutory function. Because the two House tellers 
must have been "previously appointed" by the House, according to the 
explicit terms of 3 U.S.C. § 15, there is no authority vested in the 
President of the Senate or elsewhere to appoint substitute tellers from the 
House. In other words, this Democrat asserts, there can be no 
continuation of the joint proceeding under 3 U.S.C. § 15 without the 
institutional participation of the House, and the House has resolved that 
institutionally it will not invite the Senate back to its chambers for the 
continuation of the joint proceeding unless and until the President of the 
Senate announces that the electoral votes bearing the certificate of 
Pennsylvania's governor will be counted, per the terms of 3 U.S.C. § 15. 
Notwithstanding this objection from the Democratic senator, Pence 
purports to proceed with the counting of electoral votes from Rhode 
Island to Wyoming. At the end, Pence announces that Trump has been 
re-elected president with a majority of votes, 260 out of 518 electors 
appointed, because Pennsylvania failed to appoint electors in a manner 
Congress could recognize as authoritative given the procedures set forth 
in 3 U.S.C. § 15. Later, with Pence and other Republicans at his side, 
including Mitch McConnell, Trump announces that he is proceeding to 
prepare to be inaugurated for a second term on January 20. 
Meanwhile, with Warren arid other Democrats at her side, Pelosi 
asserts that she is prepared to be inaugurated and sworn in as acting 
president, taking the presidential oath of office specified in Article II, 
serving as such until the counting of electoral votes is completed (with 
Pennsylvania's votes counted as cast by the electors certified by the 
state's governor). Pelosi makes clear her belief that Warren is the duly 
elected president, based on a proper counting of electoral votes. But she 
is prepared to serve as acting president, and fully expects to do so starting 
at noon on January 20, unless and until Pence beforehand--during the 
remainder of his term as vice president, which expires at noon on January 
20-announces his recognition of Warren as president-elect. Pelosi 
further declares that, once it is noon on January 20, with Pence no longer 
President of the Senate, it will fall to the president pro tempore (Senator 
Chuck Grassley) to declare his willingness to accept Warren as president­
elect in order for her to end her service as acting president.

2019] Preparing for a Disputed Presidential Election 339 
As the clock ticks toward noon on January 20, all ofD.C.-indeed all 
of America-is in turmoil over what will happen. Neither Trump nor 
Pelosi is backing down. Both insist that at noon on January 20 they will 
take the presidential oath and begin to assert the powers of commander 
in chief. Both demand the full support and obedience of America's armed 
forces upon taking the presidential oath. 
Attorney General William Barr announces that he believes the position 
of Trump and Pence is legally and constitutionally sound that they should 
be recognized as reelected for second terms. Pelosi dismisses Barr's 
announcement as nothing more than Trump's lawyer saying whatever 
Trump wants said. She argues that it is patently evident that Warren won 
the popular vote of Pennsylvania, and thus the election, and she is not 
going to let Trump, Pence, Barr, and the rest of the Republicans steal this 
election from Warren and the American people. She explains that she is 
prepared to serve as acting president solely to vindicate democracy and 
the proper counting of votes cast by the American people. While calling 
for calm among the public during these difficult times, Pelosi says that if 
the military, the FBI, and other federal security forces refuse to obey her 
orders as acting president starting at noon on January 20, then the 
American people must take to the streets in a massive nationwide 
demonstration of "people power" to show that their democracy will not 
be stolen from them. 
Given this situation, what is the military to do starting at noon on 
January 20? Who should the military recognize as commander-in-chief? 
Who should get the "nuclear football" with the launch codes, Trump or 
Pelosi? On what basis should the military make this decision? How does 
the nation get out of this predicament? How can the nation avoid it in the 
first place? 
B. Analysis: The Arizona Alternative 
As important as it is to think through all the ramifications of the 
foregoing scenario based on Pennsylvania, it is equally important to 
recognize that something similar could happen with respect to another 
state. But if so, the scenario does not necessarily play out in exactly the 
same way. Indeed, the differences could prove significant. 
Suppose, then, that the outcome-determinative blue shift occurs, not in 
Pennsylvania, but in Arizona. In other words, in 2020 the presidential 
election in Arizona undergoes the same phenomenon as the 2018 Senate 
race in Arizona, when the blue shift caused the lead to switch from 
McSally to Sinema. For the entire Electoral College to turn on Arizona, 
assume that the Democrat (Warren again, for sake of illustration) wins 
Pennsylvania on Election Night, and apart from Arizona's electoral votes 
Trump has 259 and Warren has 268. In this alternative scenario, assume  VP-R0000183_0032 
(2021-079) 
340 Loyola University Chicago Law Journal [Vol. 51 
Trump wins Wisconsin on Election Night. The previous scenario was 
based on Warren winning Wisconsin. Either outcome is possible, as 
Wisconsin is potentially the Electoral College "tipping state." A key point 
here, however, is that because the blue shift varies in magnitude in 
different states (with Wisconsin's historically small), the outcome in 
Wisconsin might be settled on Election Night even though it ends up 
mathematically the "tipping state" because another state-like 
Pennsylvania or Arizona--ends up shifting past the tipping point during 
the counting of "overtime" votes in the canvass. 
With Arizona substituted for Pennsylvania in this way, we can imagine 
the scenario unfolding similarly in many respects. Trump would tweet 
apoplectically about the blue shift robbing him of a victory he won 
Election Night. Democrats, in tum, would demand the proper counting of 
votes during the canvass-just as occurred in 2018, when Sinema 
overtook McSally. 
But we can imagine one crucial difference. It involves the state's 
governor. Pennsylvania's governor is a Democrat. Arizona's governor is 
a Republican. Why might this matter? Suppose the governor signs a new 
state law providing for direct appointment of the state's electors by the 
legislature-and then the governor certifies the appointment of these 
electors as authoritatively those of the states. Suppose, too, the governor 
refuses to certify the appointment of electors as shown by the final count 
of the popular vote, after the blue shift during the canvass. 
Then, on January 6, the electoral votes from Arizona bearing the 
governor's certificate are the ones for Trump, cast by the electors 
appointed directly by the state legislature. The second submission of 
electoral votes from Arizona, those for Warren cast by the electors 
purportedly appointed by means of the state's popular vote, lack a 
gubernatorial certificate. 
Suppose the Senate and House again disagree on which electoral votes 
from Arizona to accept. The Senate accepts the ones with the governor's 
certificate. The House accepts the ones reflecting the popular vote. 
Now, under this scenario, Pence rules that the votes with the 
governor's certificate must be counted. Now, Pelosi and the Democrats 
take the more dubious statutory position that neither submission of 
electoral votes from Arizona can be counted (because both are claiming 
safe-harbor status). Now, too, it is Pelosi and the Democrats who claim 
that, with Arizona having failed to appoint electors able to be recognized 
as authoritative by Congress, Warren has a majority of votes from the 
electors appointed: 268 of 527 (538 minus Arizona's 11). 
When this impasse arrives, what happens? Does Pelosi kick Pence and 
the senators out of the House chamber, insisting that the counting of 
electoral votes cannot proceed with the next state (Arkansas) until Pence  VP-R0000183_0033 
(2021-079) 
2019] Preparing for a Disputed Presidential Election 341 
recognizes the correctness of her interpretation of 3 U.S.C. § 15? Does 
she make the same declaration that she is prepared to serve as acting 
president unless and until Pence and the Republicans are willing to accept 
Warren as president-elect based on the validity of the blue-shifted popular 
vote in Arizona? 
From the perspective of the military, attempting to determine what to 
do in this impasse, does it make any difference whether it is the 
Pennsylvania or Arizona scenario? In other words, from the military's 
perspective, does it matter which side-Trump or Pelosi, Republicans or 
Democrats-has the benefit of the governor's certificate from the dispute 
state? Or, put yet another way, is it necessary for the military to make its 
own independent judgment of the correct interpretation of3 U.S.C. § 15? 
Or, instead, is the military supposed to pass judgment on the democratic 
legitimacy of the blue-shifted popular vote in the disputed state, 
regardless of whether the governor of the state sides with the popular vote 
(as in the Pennsylvania scenario) or with direct legislative appointment 
( as in the Arizona scenario)? Or must the military take its legal orders 
from the attorney general, however patently partisan those legal orders 
might appear to be? 
Given the uncertainties involved, and precariousness of the situation if 
the nation were to find itself in this position, perhaps Congress can 
undertake to clarify 3 U.S.C. § 15 in advance of the 2020 election. From 
this pre-election vantage point in 2019, it is equally uncertain whether it 
might be Pennsylvania or Arizona ( or Florida, or maybe even North 
Carolina) that experiences this outcome-determinative blue shift. Thus, · 
there is an advantageous "veil of ignorance" before the election occurs. 
Perhaps on a bipartisan basis, Congress can hammer out a new procedure 
to operate if it unfolds that there are multiple submissions of electoral 
votes from the same state. With a new and improved procedure from 
Congress to handle this situation, the goal would be no ambiguity on the 
potentially decisive issue of whether the submission bearing the 
governor's certificate is controlling, or instead whether none of the 
submissions can be counted unless both houses of Congress agree upon 
which one. 
As contemplation of these scenarios demonstrate, this issue is one for 
which ambiguity is especially detrimental-and dangerous-to the 
nation. 
IV. THE ROLE OF THE SUPREME COURT rN POTENTIAL ELECTORAL 
COUNT CONTROVERSIES 
Thus far, I have largely left the judiciary out of my description of what 
might happen in Pennsylvania, or Arizona, as a dispute over "blue shift" 
ballots counted during the canvass unfolds in the aftermath of Election  VP-R0000183_0034 
(2021-079) 
342 Loyola University Chicago Law Journal [Vol. 51 
Night and on toward January 20, 2021. I have wanted to describe the 
issues as they might appear to various non-judicial actors, including the 
state's legislature, the state's governor, the President of the Senate, the 
Speaker of the US House, the military, and so forth. Whether or not the 
state or federal judiciary becomes involved in this type of dispute, each 
of these other institutional actors will need to consider the constitutional 
and statutory issues involved and will need to decide what action to take 
in the exercise of official responsibilities. The legal ambiguities so far 
considered are potentially important, and disconcerting, for all of these 
non-judicial actors. 
Even so, it is worth considering more systematically what potential 
role courts might play, especially the Supreme Court at the apex of the 
nation's judicial system, and how judicial involvement might affect 
various non-judicial actors. Indeed, as a dispute over "blue shift" ballots 
gets closer and closer to noon on January 20, while remaining unresolved 
and thus increasingly tense, more and more eyes will look to the judiciary 
in the hope that it can get the nation out of this mess. Thus, is there some 
point at which the Supreme Court might find itself compelled to 
intervene, however reluctant it might be to do so given the widespread 
perception that its intervention in Bush v. Gore was not successful in 
achieving a solution recognized as rooted in law rather than politics? In 
other words, even if the Supreme Court were inclined to stay out of a 
dispute over the 2020 election, for fear of becoming politicized all over 
again, is there a point at which it would be forced to accept jurisdiction 
over a disputed issue and to adjudicate as best as it could according to its 
understanding of the applicable law ( even if some might perceive its 
opinion as politically motivated)? After considering what the Court itself 
might do, one can then address how various non-judicial actors, including 
Vice President Pence and Speaker Pelosi, might react to the Court's 
ruling, including whether or not they would obey a direct judicial order 
from the Court. But first it is necessary to consider what the Court itself 
might do. 
To conduct this analysis, it is best to divide the time period of a 
potential dispute into three distinct segments. First, there is the time prior 
to the meeting of the Electoral College on Monday, December 14, which 
we can characterize as the part of the overall process dominated by state 
law and the institutions of state government. Second, there is the time 
between this meeting of the Electoral College and the joint session of 
Congress on January 6, pursuant to the Twelfth Amendment and the 
Electoral Count Act, for receipt of the electoral votes from the states. This 
intermediary period is after the state government's role is complete but 
before the crucial congressional process begins. Third, there is the time 
between 1 :00 p.m. on January 6, when the opening and counting of  VP-R0000183_0035 
(2021-079) 
2019] Preparing for a Disputed Presidential Election 343 
electoral votes from the states begins in the joint session of Congress and 
noon on January 20, when the transfer of power from one presidential 
term to the next occurs automatically by virtue of the explicit language 
of the Twentieth Amendment. 63 This two-week period is one in which 
federal law dominates and the institutions of the federal government 
control what happens. It would be possible to consider a fourth period, 
the time after noon on January 20; but insofar as it is of paramount 
importance to resolve any dispute before the clock strikes noon on 
January 20--so that there is no doubt who is constitutionally commander 
in chief at that moment and thus capable of activating the nuclear codes 
(among other military powers)-it is worth focusing on the possibility of 
judicial involvement, however reluctant, prior to this critical moment. 
A. Before the Electoral College Meets on Monday, December 14 
Article II of the Constitution requires that the presidential electors of 
every state meet on the same day to cast their votes for president. 64 
Congress has specified that date as Monday, December 14, as Congress 
is entitled to do. Up until that time, state law may determine the method 
of appointing a state's electors, as Article II also provides. 
Both state and federal courts can become involved in the process of 
determining the identity of the state's electors prior to when they meet to 
cast their electoral votes. State courts can do so pursuant to express 
delegations of power from the state's legislature, or pursuant to a 
purported exercise of authority derived from the state's constitution. In 
this respect, state court involvement would be similar to what occurred in 
Florida in 2000: As all will remember or can review the history, Florida's 
judiciary became actively involved in the fight over which political 
party's slate of presidential electors were to become the ones entitled to 
cast their state's official electoral votes. Whether or not these Florida 
state-court decisions were faithful interpretations of existing state law at 
the time was, and remains, debatable. There is no doubt that many 
observers, including some members of the federal Supreme Court, 
viewed the Florida Supreme Court as a lawless and partisan institution, 
because its purported "interpretation" of relevant state statutes was so 
aberrant from their text. But there is no doubt that Florida's judiciary had 
jurisdiction to address the various state-law issues that arose over the 
counting of votes in the 2000 election. Thus, Florida courts issued decrees 
against Florida election officials, like the secretary of state, that were 
63. U.S. CONST. amend. XX ("The terms of the President and Vice President shall end at noon 
on the 20th day of January ... and the terms of their successors shall then begin."). 
64. U.S. CONST. art. 11, § 1, cl. 4 (emphasis adde<l) ("The Congress may determine the time of 
choosing the electors, and the day on which they shall give their votes; which day shall be the same 
throughout the United States.").  VP-R0000183_0036 
(2021-079) 
344 Loyola University Chicago Law Journal [Vol. 51 
within their judicial authority. In the same way, we can foresee state 
courts-in Pennsylvania, Arizona, or elsewhere-similarly issuing 
judicial decrees concerning the counting of "blue shift" votes. These 
courts could rule for or against either candidate's position on these issues, 
depending on the specific issues raised and evidence presented, and 
potentially depending also on the degree to which a state court might 
render rulings that to some could appear surprisingly lawless and 
partisan. 65 
Likewise, federal courts could become involved in the counting of 
ballots cast by citizens in presidential elections prior to the day on which 
the electors meet. The Supreme Court itself may become involved insofar 
as issues of federal law are raised by the way the state courts handle their 
own involvement in these cases. Again, the 2000 presidential election in 
_Florida is illustrative: twice the Supreme Court granted certiorari review 
over federal constitutional questions arising from how the Florida 
Supreme Court conducted itself on appeal from lawsuits filed initially in 
state court.66 Separate federal-court lawsuits were also filed in an effort 
to challenge vote-counting conduct undertaken by Florida officials. 
Although these lawsuits did not become dispositive at the Supreme Court 
in 2000, in the future this type of lawsuit could become the vehicle by 
which the Supreme Court makes a pronouncement on what federal law 
requires in terms of the counting of popular-vote ballots by state officials. 
Thus, the 2020 election could see federal-court involvement, including 
the Supreme Court's involvement, equivalent to what occurred in 2000. 
But whatever that involvement might be, assuming that it does occur, 
it would not result in injunctions directed against the President of the 
Senate, or the Congress as a whole, concerning the conduct at the joint 
session of Congress on January 6. Nor, in all likelihood, would any 
judicial orders be directed to the presidential electors themselves or their 
meeting on December 14. Instead, the judicial orders would be directed 
to state and/or local election administrators, ordering them to count---or 
not to count-particular "blue shift" ballots. These judicial orders could 
prove crucial in determining which party's slate of presidential electors, 
Republican or Democratic, is officially certified the winner of the popular 
vote in the state. Potentially, too, these judicial orders might purport to 
bind and direct the governor to certify one of these two slates of electors 
as the officially authoritative ones. 
65. The ALI project is designed, in part, to reduce the likelihood that state courts in this type of 
situation would render rulings that appear lawless and partisan. 
66. See BALLOT BATTLES, supra note 25, at 279-305 (reviewing the presidential election of 
2000 and the Supreme Court's involvement).  VP-R0000183_0037 
(2021-079) 
2019] Preparing for a Disputed Presidential Election 345 
But it is difficult to foresee a judicial decree, from either a state or 
federal court, purporting to ban a party's slate of presidential electors 
from assembling on Monday, December 14. Perhaps there would be a 
declaratory judgment ordering that the meeting lacked any official status. 
But would the court order these individuals not even to assemble together 
to engage in discourse? Apart from raising questions regarding whether 
such an order would intrude upon congressional prerogatives under the 
Electoral Count Act (and the Twelfth Amendment), it would raise so 
many First Amendment and related difficulties as to seem unfathomable. 
Thus, while state and federal courts may play significant roles in 
shaping the dynamics of a dispute that reaches Congress, by declaring 
who is the lawful winner of the state's popular vote and which slate of 
presidential electors the state's governor must certify as authoritative, 
ultimately neither the state nor federal judiciary can prevent a party's 
slate of presidential electors from purporting to meet on December 14 and 
acting as if they can cast the state's electoral votes---even if those 
individuals lack any indicia of authority under state law. As long as these 
individuals do meet and do purport to send their electoral votes to the 
President of the Senate, then even the intervention of the Supreme Court 
cannot stop a dispute regarding a state's electoral votes from reaching 
Congress. 
B. Between December 14 and January 6 
Once it is known that both the Republican and Democratic slates of 
electors in a particular state have met on December 14 and purported to 
cast their electoral votes and send them to the President of the Senate, 
then it is possible to envision a lawsuit attempting to order the President 
of the Senate, or Congress collectively, to accept one of these two 
submissions as the valid one. This lawsuit would attempt to have the court 
declare the lawfully correct interpretation of the Electoral Count Act and 
the Twelfth Amendment as applied to the particular situation, and to have 
the court order the President of the Senate (and Congress collectively) to 
act in accordance with this judicial interpretation. What is the chance of 
such a lawsuit being successful, meaning that it would result in the court 
issuing the decree requested (putting aside whether the decree would be 
obeyed)? 
First, it is worth briefly mentioning that no state court would have 
authority to issue such a judicial order. Even if the state court purports to 
have a state-law reason for declaring one submission of electoral votes 
from the state as valid, and the other submission as invalid, the state court 
would be powerless to bind the President of the Senate or Congress to act 
in accordance with that state-law declaration. To be sure, the state court 
could render an official judgment, which could (and would) be presented  VP-R0000183_0038 
(2021-079) 
346 Loyola University Chicago Law Journal [Vol. 51 
along with the electoral votes it validates as a matter of state law. But if 
Congress decided to repudiate that state-court judgment and count the 
alternative submission of electoral votes from the state instead, the state 
court would be powerless to order Congress in contempt of its judicial 
decree and mandate that Congress comply instead. To sharpen the point: 
imagine both houses of Congress rejecting the position of the Arizona 
Supreme Court and deciding to count the electoral votes from Arizona 
that the state supreme court considered invalid. It remains possible, of 
course, that th~ state supreme court is correct about what is the position 
of state law on the matter, but it is within the constitutional prerogative 
of Congress to reach the opposite conclusion. The Arizona Supreme 
Court cannot issue an injunction against Congress demanding that 
Congress comply with its judicial decree. That would be constitutionally 
preposterous even if the Arizona Supreme Court is correct and Congress 
incorrect on the relevant issues of Arizona law. 
What about the federal Supreme Court in this situation? Suppose, to 
use the Pennsylvania scenario, that the Democratic electors from 
Pennsylvania have the governor's certificate as well as a ruling from the 
Pennsylvania Supreme Court that they are the state's authoritative 
electors. These electors also were the winners of the popular vote, as 
determined by the canvass of returns pursuant to state law. The 
submission of these electors comes to Congress with as strong a pedigree 
in state law as imaginable. Meanwhile, the conflicting submission from 
the Republican electors is especially weak, having no gubernatorial 
certificate, no imprimatur of the state's judiciary, no popular-vote 
pedigree, and having only the assertion of direct appointment by the state 
legislature. Suppose further that these Democratic electors file suit in 
federal court, asking for an injunction that the president of the Senate and 
Congress accept their submission of electoral votes as the valid ones from 
Pennsylvania. Does the federal judiciary have the power to issue this 
injunction, given the strength of the submission on behalf these electoral 
votes? 
This question is a tricky one. There is a strong argument that this 
injunction would be beyond the jurisdiction of the federal court, as a 
matter of either statutory or constitutional law. Justice Breyer took this 
position in his Bush v. Gore dissent, on the basis that Congress considered 
but declined to vest authority in the federal courts when deciding the 
procedures of the Electoral Count Act. 67 Justice Breyer also viewed this 
congressional judgment as consistent with the delegation of authority in 
the Twelfth Amendment itself: 
67. See generally Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98, 144-58 (2000) (Breyer, J., dissenting).  VP-R0000183_0039 
(2021-079) 
2019] Preparing for a Disputed Presidential Election 
The decision by both the Constitution's Framers and the 1886 Congress 
to minimize this Court's role in resolving close federal Presidential 
elections is as wise as it is clear. However awkward or difficult it may 
be for Congress to resolve difficult electoral disputes, Congress, being 
a political body, expresses the people's will far more accurately than 
does an unelected Court. 68 347 
Justice Breyer is certainly correct that the congressional authors of the 
Electoral Count Act considered but rejected a role for the federal courts 
in the process of conducting the electoral count. They were disappointed, 
or even angered, at the role five justices played during the Hayes-Tilden 
dispute, and they wanted no more such judicial involvement. 69 Nor is 
there any reason to think that the authors of the Twelfth Amendment 
envisioned a role for the federal judiciary in the resolution of a dispute 
over the counting of electoral votes. Thus, despite the strength of the 
Democratic electors' claim on the underlying merits of their authoritative 
status, it would be a giant stretch to say that a federal court would grant 
them the judicial relief they (hypothetically) request. 
Similarly, even if there is no absolute barrier to federal judicial relief 
in this posture, it is difficult to imagine Chief Justice Roberts wanting to 
lead the federal judiciary into intervening in the electoral dispute. The 
issue is in some sense unripe or premature. Until the joint session of 
Congress occurs on January 6, there has not yet been any action in 
violation of federal law. Even if pundits on cable news and Twitter 
speculate about what may happen on January 6-indeed, even if Mike 
Pence himself says what he is going to do-until it happens there is 
nothing to complain about. When the time actually comes to count 
Pennsylvania's electoral votes, both the Senate and the House may agree 
that it is the Democratic electors whose votes should count, and Mike 
Pence as President of the Senate may accept that result, in which case 
there is no basis or need for a federal-court injunction. Given this 
possibility, and given an inclination to exercise what Bickel called the 
"passive virtues,"70 it seems unimaginable that a majority of the Supreme 
Court under the chief justice's leadership would permit a lower federal 
court to order what must happen at the January 6 joint session before that 
session actually occurs. The Court's pronouncement could come in the 
form of "balancing the equities" as a justification for denying preliminary 
injunctive relief, rather than as a categorical pronouncement regarding 
the political question doctrine or a similar limitation. Either way, the

348. Loyola University Chicago Law Journal [Vol. 51 
Democratic electors as plaintiffs would come away empty-handed, 
without the requested judicial relief. 
C. Between January 6 and January 20 
The considerations become more complicated if the January 6 
proceedings take a turn that appears to many as abusively unlawful. To 
continue with the same example, we can imagine that the House of 
Representatives has voted to accept · the Democratic electors as 
authoritative-based on the governor's signature, among other indicia­
while the Senate does the opposite. Rather than ruling in favor of the 
Democrats, Pence as President of the Senate invalidates both conflicting 
certificates. At this point, the Democrats go straight to federal court, 
seeking an injunction to reverse Pence's ruling and rule the Democratic 
electors' votes as the valid ones from Pennsylvania. Does the Supreme 
Court now authorize this judicial remedy, even if it would not do so 
before January 6? 
The case for this judicial decree is much stronger in this posture, 
particularly as the calendar moves closer to January 20 with the situation 
unresolved and both Trump and Pelosi announcing that they are prepared 
to assume the powers of commander-in-chief (in Pelosi's case as acting 
president) at noon that day. There still remains the force of Justice 
Breyer's dissent in Bush v. Gore-that neither the Constitution nor the 
Electoral Count Act contemplate a role for the judiciary even in this 
deadlocked posture. But the balance of equities shift increasingly in favor 
of judicial intervention as the conflict continues, and the practical need 
for an answer becomes imperative as January 20 approaches. 
One way to increase the odds of judicial intervention would be to 
change the nature of the lawsuit. Instead of a claim brought by 
Democratic electors seeking an injunction against the president of the 
Senate or Congress, imagine a lawsuit brought by an individual whose 
personal rights would be affected if Nancy Pelosi is acting president, 
instead of Donald Trump being president, starting at noon on January 20. 
Suppose Pelosi has announced that right at noon her first executive order 
as acting president will be to permit transgendered individuals to serve in 
the military, thereby repudiating President Trump's executive order to the 
contrary. Suppose a transgendered individual sues, seeking the right to 
join the military based on this executive order on the assumption that 
Pelosi will be entitled to issue it at noon. 
One can imagine a federal court adjudicating the validity of this 
executive order, in order to decide whether to grant the plaintiff the 
requested injunctive relief against the Department of Defense. Ordinarily, 
this kind of case would be a routine exercise of the federal judiciary's  VP-R0000183_0041 
(2021-079) 
2019] Preparing for a Disputed Presidential Election 349 
powers under Marbury v. Madison.71 In this instance, the case is 
complicated by the fact that determination of the validity of the executive 
order requires a judicial pronouncement on the federal question whether 
Pelosi is--or will be-acting president as of noon on January 20. But this 
is a question of federal law that the Court must consider as part of the 
exercise of its ordinary jurisdiction. It does not require the Court to issue 
an injunction directly against the president of the Senate or Congress, 
with respect to the specific function of counting the electoral votes. Thus, 
it is easier to envision the Court issuing this kind of judicial decree, which 
at least would instruct the military as to who to obey as commander in 
chief starting at noon on January 20: Pelosi as acting president, or Trump 
as re-inaugurated. The military could then rely on this determination 
more broadly, including for the purposes of deciding who gets access to 
the nuclear codes, even if access to the nuclear codes is not itself a directly 
justiciable issue. 
It is important to note, however, that this kind of judicial decree is not 
the same as telling Pence and Congress what to do under the Electoral 
Count Act and/or the Twelfth Amendment. This is potentially significant. 
If the hypothetical lawsuit brought by the Democratic electors were 
successful, it would lead to the consequence of the Democratic nominee 
(in this hypothetical, Elizabeth Warren) being declared president-elect. In 
other words, if the Court did order the president of the Senate to accept 
the electoral votes from Pennsylvania bearing the governor's certificate, 
then-assuming those 20 electoral votes are in favor of Warren and make 
the difference in the Electoral College outcome-this judicial decree 
would result in Warren taking the oath of office as president by virtue of 
the Twelfth Amendment. 
By contrast, if the Court embraces Justice Breyer's view and refuses 
to issue a judicial order concerning the electoral count directly, but the 
Court accepts the proposition that Nancy Pelosi becomes acting president 
as long as the electoral count remains unfinished without the institutional 
participation oftbe House of Representatives in the Twelfth Amendment 
procedure, then the consequence is Pelosi become acting president, rather 
than Warren becoming president. That distinction could become 
significant in many ways, not merely the initial superficial ones. 
Moreover, depending on how the Court views its role, its involvement 
might be unrelated to the "merits" of the presidential election itself. This 
point emerges if we compare the Pennsylvania and Arizona versions of 
the hypothetical we have been considering. The distinction between the 
two scenarios may be extremely significant for determining the correct 
71. See generally Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803) (establishing the now-widely 
accepted concept of judicial review).  VP-R0000183_0042

350 Loyola University Chicago Law Journal [Vol. 51 
application of the Electoral Count Act--especially if one takes the view 
that the governor's certificate is dispositive under the correct 
interpretation of the statute. But that point about the proper meaning of 
the Electoral Count Act may be irrelevant if the Court is deciding, not 
what Pence or Congress must do under the proper -interpretation of that 
statute, but instead whether or not there is an acting president given solely 
the brute fact that the count of electoral votes under the Twelfth 
Amendment remains incomplete because of the institutional non­
participation of the House of Representatives. The House might be 
entirely unjustified under the Electoral Count Act for the position it takes, 
but if the Court has no power to control the Twelfth Amendment 
proceeding and has only the power to declare the consequence of its being 
incomplete, then the judicial role may be limited to acknowledging that 
there is no president-elect under the Twelfth Amendment, even if the 
cause of that reality was some form of improper conduct. 
The contemplation of this possibility only underscores the point made 
earlier: it would be so much better if Congress, in advance of the election, 
would eliminate, as much as possible, the ambiguities that exist in the 
Electoral Count Act process in order to diminish the likelihood that some 
of these difficult scenarios might arise. 
CONCLUSION 
We must hope that none of what is described in this article comes to 
pass. Instead, the nation will be well served if the outcome of the 2020 
presidential election is so lopsided as to be impossible to dispute. Even if 
President Trump were inclined to resist a result that everyone else, 
including all Republican Senators accept, it would be impossible for him 
to cling to power as long as Congress conclusively concludes that his 
opponent is the winner. America's military will recognize Trump's 
opponent as the new commander in chief once Congress authoritatively 
declares this electoral outcome, and any protests from Trump to the 
contrary will be utterly ineffectual. 
The problem would occur, ifit does, when the two houses of Congress 
cannot agree as to which candidate won the presidential election. This 
kind of disagreement is unlikely to develop unless something happens 
that gives Republicans and Democrats in Congress a plausible basis for 
disputing the outcome. But a key premise of this article is that it would 
not take an extraordinary calamity, like a foreign cyberattack, for there to 
be conditions enabling partisans to dispute the result. Instead, a dispute 
engulfing Congress could arise from a situation as routine as the kind of 
"blue shift" described at the outset. 
Given this possibility, it is truly irresponsible that Congress has not 
attempted to eliminate-in advance of the 2020 election-the  VP-R0000183_0043

2019] Preparing for a Disputed Presidential Election 351 
ambiguities that plague the Electoral Count Act. The purpose of the 
statute is to handle the circumstance in which Congress is divided over 
the outcome of a presidential election. But the statute is woefully 
inadequate for its intended purpose. If Congress fails to remedy this 
inadequacy before ballots are cast, then the nation will have to cope as 
best as it can if the two houses of Congress disagree when they meet on 
January 6, 2021, to officially declare the result of the 2020 election. And 
the more it appears that Congress is unable to resolve this disagreement 
before noon on January 20, when the new president is to be inaugurated, 
the more it will appear necessary that the Supreme Court must settle the 
matter again, despite whatever reluctance it might have for a repetition of 
its role in 2000. 
APPENDIX 
Because the body of this article is written in the form of narrative 
scenarios, this Appendix is included to provide a more conventional 
analysis of the relevant legal provisions. 
A. Text of the Electoral Count Act 
3 U.S.C. § 15 is very long and best considered in chunks. It begins 
straightforwardly: 
Congress shall be in session on the sixth day of January succeeding 
every meeting of the electors. The Senate and House of Representatives 
shall meet in the Hall of the House of Representatives at the hour of 1 
o'clock in the afternoon on that day, and the President of the Senate 
shall be their presiding officer. 
It also acknowledges the fact that Congress may receive submissions of 
"purported" electoral votes of dubious status, and that this special joint 
session will consider each state in alphabetical order: 
Two tellers shall be previously appointed on the part of the Senate and 
two on the part of the House of Representatives, to whom shall be 
handed, as they are opened by the President of the Senate, all the 
certificates and papers purporting to be certificates of the electoral 
votes, which certificates and papers shall be opened, presented, and 
acted upon in the alphabetical order of the States, beginning with the 
letter A; and said tellers, having then read the same in the presence and 
hearing of the two Houses, shall make a list of the votes as they shall 
appear from the said certificates .... 
At this point the language of the statute starts to get a bit opaque: 
[A]nd the votes having been ascertained and counted according to the 
rules in this subchapter provided, the result of the same shall be 
delivered to the President of the Senate, who shall thereupon announce 
the state of the vote, which announcement shall be deemed a sufficient 
declaration of the persons, if any, elected President and Vice President  VP-R0000183_0044 
(2021-079) 
352 Loyola University Chicago Law Journal [Vol. 51 
of the United States, and, together with a list of the votes, be entered on 
the Journals of the two Houses. 
I suppose the immediately preceding passage is straightforward enough 
when there is no dispute: the votes will be counted and the result 
announced. But when there is a dispute the remainder of this statute 
provides for some pretty rough sledding. Of course, the existence of a 
dispute will be apparent if raised at the joint session: 
Upon such reading of any such certificate or paper, the President of the 
Senate shall call for objections, if any. Every objection shall be made in 
writing, and shall state clearly and concisely, and without argument, the 
ground thereof, and shall be signed by at least one Senator and one 
Member of the House of Representatives before the same shall be 
received. 
Once this kind of objection exists, the key structural feature of the process 
is that the two chambers of Congress-the Senate and the House-are 
supposed to deliberate about the objection separately; no decisions are to 
be made by the combined joint session of the two bodies: 
When all objections so made to any vote or paper from a State shall 
have been received and read, the Senate shall thereupon withdraw, and 
such objections shall be submitted to the Senate for its decision; and the 
Speaker of the House of Representatives shall, in like manner, submit 
such objections to the House of Representatives for its decision .... 
It is the consequence of potentially divergent decisions by the Senate and 
the House that could cause trouble-because there is a need to know what 
happens if and when the Senate and House disagree over an objection of 
this nature. 
At this point, the statute bifurcates its consideration of the situation 
depending on whether there is one or more "return" of electoral votes 
submitted for a state. If there is only one such return, the statute provides: 
No electoral vote or votes from any State which shall have been 
regularly given by electors whose appointment has been lawfully 
certified to according to section 6 of this title from which but one return 
has been received shall be rejected, but the two Houses concurrently 
may reject the vote or votes when they agree that such vote or votes 
have not been so regularly given by electors whose appointment has 
been so certified. 
This passage immediately raises some questions: for example, what does 
it mean by "regularly given"? What does the cross-reference to 3 U.S.C. 
§ 6 entail? It turns out that this latter question can be handled fairly easily. 
Section 6 provides that the "executive" of each state-presumably the 
governor-must give to the state's electors, as well as to the "Archivist 
of the United States"--official copies "under the seal of the State" of a 
document, called a "certificate of ascertainment," which shows those 
electors to be the individuals duly appointed as the state's electors ''under  VP-R0000183_0045 
(2021-079) 
2019] Preparing for a Disputed Presidential Election 353 
and pursuant to the laws of such State." This certificate of ascertainment 
must include, insofar as is applicable, "the number of [popular] votes 
given or cast for each person for whose appointment any and all votes 
have been given or cast." Section 6 even provides that, in the event of a 
dispute over the appointment of a state's electors, the state's "executive" 
must send to the archivist an additional certificate showing the "final 
determination" of the "controversy or contest" according to the laws of 
the state. Thus, this passage of the statute contemplates that there might 
be disputation over a single "return" of electoral votes from a state, but 
fairly clearly seems to provide that this single return must be accepted as 
valid-"no electoral vote ... shall be rejected"-unless both chambers 
of Congress agree to reject that return (and its electoral votes) as invalid. 
While neither chamber should reject the electoral votes of this single 
return unless they "have not been so regularly given," as a practical matter 
it doesn't seem that it would make a difference if there was confusion or 
disagreement over what "regularly given" means. If both chambers 
independently determine that they are not regularly given, then those 
electoral votes are rejected. If one chamber thinks they are regularly 
given, while the other does not, then those electoral votes must be 
accepted and counted when the joint session resumes. 
It is now, when the statute begins to address the possibility that 
Congress receives multiple returns of electoral votes from the same state, 
that the rough interpretative terrain really begins: 
If more than one return or paper purporting to be a return from a State 
shall have been received by the President of the Senate, those votes, and 
those only, shall be counted which shall have been regularly given by 
the electors who are shown by the determination mentioned in section 
5 of this title to have been appointed, if the determination in said section 
provided for shall have been made, or by such successors or substitutes, 
in case of a vacancy in the board of electors so ascertained, as have been 
appointed to fill such vacancy in the mode provided by the laws of the 
State .... 
This portion of the statute, by its cross-reference to 3 U.S.C. § 5 (which 
is the so-called "Safe Harbor" provision), seems to require the counting 
of whichever return-and only that single return-that is compliant with 
Safe Harbor status, as defined in 3 U.S.C. § 5. The last clause of this 
portion acknowledges the possibility that the electors who cast a state's 
electoral votes may be "successors or substitutes" to those whose 
appointment complied with Safe Harbor status; but we can set aside this 
"successors or substitutes" qualification. The key point is the 
identification of which "return" of electoral votes, among multiple from 
the same state, is the single one that complies (if any does) with Safe 
Harbor status.  VP-R0000183_0046 
(2021-079) 
354 Loyola University Chicago Law Journal [Vol. 51 
To recall (as many may remember these points from Bush v. Gore), 
there are two key components to satisfying Safe Harbor status according 
to 3 U.S.C. § 5. The first is a timing prerequisite that has been dubbed the 
"Safe Harbor Deadline": the "final determination of any controversy or 
contest concerning the appointment of all or any of the electors of such 
State" must occur "at least six days before the time fixed for the meeting 
of the electors." In 2020, the Safe Harbor deadline is Tuesday, 
December 8. Given the way Congress has structured the relationship 
between Election Day in November and the meeting of the electors in 
December, the Safe Harbor deadline falls exactly five weeks after 
Election Day, which in 2020 is Tuesday, November 3. 
The second crucial prerequisite to Safe Harbor status under 3 U.S.C. 
§ 5 is that this "final determination" of any dispute over the appointment 
of a state's electors must be made "pursuant" to "laws enacted prior to 
the day fixed for the appointment of the electors," meaning enacted 
before Election Day (in 2020, November 3). It is not enough to meet the 
Safe Harbor deadline with the resolution of the dispute. If the basis for 
the resolution is new law adopted after Election Day, then the resolution 
fails to achieve Safe Harbor status even if the resolution occurs before 
December 8. 
But if both key prerequisites are satisfied, it seems to follow that the 
return of electoral votes from the state that embodies this two-part 
compliance is the controlling return from the state, which must be 
counted by Congress to the exclusion of any other conflicting return from 
the same state. This consequence seems to be mandated by the explicit 
language of both 3 U.S.C. § 5 and 3 U.S.C. § 15. Section 5 states that a 
"final determination" meeting the two Safe Harbor prerequisites "shall be 
conclusive, and shall govern in the counting of the electoral votes as 
provided in the Constitution, and as hereinafter regulated, so far as the 
ascertainment of the electors appointed by such State is concerned." And 
§ 15, as set forth above, says that "those votes, and only those, shall be 
counted which shall have been regularly given by" those electors whose 
appointment satisfies Safe Harbor status. Thus, both chambers of 
Congress seem obligated to count the one return (if there is more than one 
submitted) that is Safe Harbor compliant. 
The problem arises, however, if the two chambers of Congress purport 
to disagree about which return (if any), among multiple returns, has 
achieved Safe Harbor status. This disagreement may be sincere, or it may 
be pretextual based on partisan posturing on one side or the other. 
Whatever the case may be, the acute question exists: what to do if the two 
chambers of Congress institutionally announce a disagreement over 
which, if any of multiple returns, is Safe Harbor compliant? It is on this  VP-R0000183_0047 
(2021-079) 
2019] Preparing for a Disputed Presidential Election 355 
crucial point that the ambiguity of the statute becomes especially vexing 
and distressing: 
[B]ut in case there shall arise the question which of two or more of such 
State authorities determining what electors have been appointed, as 
mentioned in section 5 of this title, is the lawful tribunal of such State, 
the votes regularly given of those electors, and those only, of such State 
shall be counted whose title as electors the two Houses, acting 
separately, shall concurrently decide is supported by the decision of 
such State so authorized by its law .... 
This portion of the statute seems to provide that, if more than one return 
from a state claims Safe Harbor status, then neither can count unless both 
chambers of Congress agree on which one is the single return truly 
entitled to Safe Harbor status. The words say "only" those electoral votes 
"shall be counted" which were cast by electors "the two Houses, acting 
separately, shall concurrently decide is supported by the decision of such 
State so authorized by its law," meaning compliant with the Safe Harbor 
prerequisites. 
Yet there is more to the statute, and it horribly complicates the matter. 
The next clause provides: 
[A]nd in such case of more than one return or paper purporting to be a 
return from a State, if there shall have been no such determination of 
the question in the State aforesaid, then those votes, and those only, 
shall be counted which the two Houses shall concurrently decide were 
cast by lawful electors appointed in accordance with the laws of the 
State, unless the two Houses, acting separately, shall concurrently 
decide such votes not to be the lawful votes of the legally appointed 
electors of such State. 
This clause seems to address the circumstance in which no return from a 
state claims Safe Harbor status but there is still the question of which 
among the multiple returns, if any, should be counted in Congress. The 
clause seems to say that in this circumstance the only return that can be 
counted is one accepted as valid by both houses of Congress. The clause, 
rather confusingly, seems to distinguish between valid appointment of 
electors and valid votes cast by validly appointed electors-recognizing 
that the two chambers of Congress (at least theoretically) might agree that 
duly appointed electors might for some reason cast unlawful votes 
(perhaps bribed), or that the purported returns of undeniably valid 
electors were fraudulent concoctions. But once that bit of confusion is 
cleared up, this clause seems to be saying that "only" those votes from 
electors that both Houses considered valid can be counted (when none of 
the multiple returns from the state has Safe Harbor pedigree). 
But, wait, there's more (to invoke the spirit of Marisa Tomei's 
immortal performance in "My Cousin Vinny"). Immediately after the 
just-considered clause, 3 U.S.C. § 15 starts a new sentence:  VP-R0000183_0048 
(2021-079) 
356 Loyola University Chicago Law Journal [Vol. 51 
But if the two Houses shall disagree in respect of the counting of such 
votes, then, and in that case, the votes of the electors whose appointment 
shall have been certified by the executive of the State, under the seal 
thereof: shall be counted. 
The troublesome question is how this new sentence relates to what 
preceded it. It seems to contradict everything that comes before insofar 
those earlier clauses seemed to require both chambers of Congress to 
agree in order for one of several disputed returns to count. Now it seems 
that, if the two chambers of Congress disagree, then to be counted is 
whichever return of electoral votes from a state (if any) were cast by 
electors "whose appointment shall have been certified by the executive 
of the State," meaning governor. 
One conceptual possibility is that this new sentence operates upon the 
immediately preceding clause, the one concerning what to do when none 
of multiple returns are claimed to have Safe Harbor status. The other 
conceptual possibility is that this new sentence operates upon all 
preceding clauses involving multiple returns, both when none claim Safe 
Harbor status and when more than one so claim. Given the separation of 
this new sentence from what precedes it by a period rather than semi­
colon, it can be argued-as it has been-that this punctuation is reason 
to favor the latter, broader interpretation, namely that the new sentence 
affect both circumstances, and not just the situation in which none of 
multiple returns claims Safe Harbor status. But whatever the strength of 
this interpretative argument based on the bare text of the statute alone, 
the fact is that the text is not sufficiently clear to rule out the possibility 
of alternative interpretations. And, what is especially troublesome, is that 
the existing literature on this point contains advocates for conflicting 
interpretations. 
B. Existing Interpretations of 3 US. C. § 15 
In 1961, a law professor named Kinvin Wroth (who later was dean at 
two different law schools, University of Maine and University of 
Vermont) wrote a law review article on the interpretation of the Electoral 
Count Act. In this article, Wroth took the position that under the proper 
interpretation of 3 U.S.C. § 15 the governor's certification was not 
controlling in the specific situation where two returns purport to claim 
Safe Harbor status. 72 Instead, according to Wroth, in this situation "no 
vote from the state is counted."73 Wrath's reasoning was that a governor's 
72. See Wroth, supra note 52, at 343 ("If the Houses cannot agree on the authoritative 
determination, or, if, as in the case of Louisiana in 1873, they agree that no determination was 
authoritative, the principle of the Twenty-second Joint Rule is applied and no vote from the state 
in question is counted. This result follows regardless of the governor's action."). 
73. Id.  VP-R0000183_0049 
(2021-079) 
2019] Preparing for a Disputed Presidential Election 357 
certification can only be "evidence" of a return having Safe Harbor status; 
the governor's certification cannot give the return Safe Harbor status. 
Thus, if two (or more) returns purport to have Safe Harbor status, but the 
two Houses of Congress cannot agree on which one, then neither return 
( or none of them) is capable of superior status and each return must be 
rejected. In Wroth's own words: "If the decision of the authorized 
tribunal cannot be made out, then there is no valid return for the 
government to certify."74 By contrast (under Wroth's interpretation of the 
statute), if no return claims Safe Harbor status, then the governor's 
certificate is in in a position for conveying which return from the state is 
authoritative. 
In 200 l, as Congress was preparing to receive the electoral votes in the 
2000 presidential election, a report of the Congressional Research Service 
(CRS) embraced Wroth's view of the statute, citing and quoting Wrath's 
article extensively. 75 The CRS report added more arguments of its own, 
claiming that the legislative history of the Electoral Count Act supported 
Wrath's interpretation. The CRS reports quotes a Senator who played a 
particularly influential role in the drafting of the statute: "In the debates 
and final report of the Conference Committee, it is clear that the provision 
for the governor's certificate to control in the disagreement of the Houses 
was to apply only in the case of double returns without a state 
determination."76 The CRS report adds its own gloss to this point: "it 
appears that the [legislative] intent was ... to give a deferential position 
to the governor's certification only where there is no [timely] 
determination from a state authority under an election contest 
procedure. "77 
In 2004, however, a different law professor-Stephen Siegel-wrote 
a lengthy law review article that contradicted the Wroth-CRS 
interpretation and instead argued that the governor's certificate controls 
whenever the two Houses of Congress disagree over multiple returns 
from the same state, including when the two chambers disagree on which 
of multiple returns claiming Safe Harbor status is the one entitled to that 
status.78 Siegel premised his alternative interpretation both on the 
punctuation of the statute's text-the period, rather than semi-colon, was 
a strong indication (in his view) that the new sentence concerning the

supra note 52, at 344-45 (asserting that when multiple submissions of electoral votes from the 
same state all claim "safe harbor" protection, none can be counted unless both houses of Congress 
agree upon which submission is entitled to this "safe harbor'' status).

358 Loyola University Chicago Law Journal [Vol. 51 
governor's certificate applied to all of the preceding sentence, and not 
just its final clause-as well as his own differing view of the statute's 
legislative history. Based on his comprehensive analysis of what he 
acknowledged was an extensive and convoluted legislative record, 
involving a decade of debate between the disputed Hayes-Tilden election 
of 1876 and the eventual enactment of the statute in 1887, Siegel argued 
that the final compromise endeavored to minimize the circumstances in 
which a state would have no electoral votes counted because of a 
disagreement between the two chambers of Congress over which, of 
multiple returns, should be counted. Given this congressional preference 
for counting at least something from a state whenever possible, the 
congressional compromise settled on making the governor's certificate 
the tiebreaker in all circumstances in which the two chambers of 
Congress disagreed over which of multiple returns from the same state to 
count. In Siegel's own words: "[T]he governor's certificate as a fail-safe 
to prevent state disenfranchisement was a very conscious, if 
controversial, choice. Without it, the ECA would not have passed. . . . 
[G]ranting the state governor his tie-breaking _authority clearly was the 
choice Congress made. "79 One question for consideration is whether it is 
possible to develop a nonpartisan scholarly consensus in advance of 
November 2020 on whether Siegel or Wroth-CRS has the better of this 
interpretative debate-and thus whether at least this potential source of 
disputation can be set aside. 
C. Other Ambiguities Concerning 3 USC.§ 15 
Even if the debate between Siegel and Wroth-CRS could be resolved, 
there are still other uncertainties concerning the application of 
3 U.S.C. 15. Here are two worth considering: 
First, a state's supreme court definitively resolves a dispute over the 
appointment of a state's electors prior to the Safe Harbor deadline, 
thereby seemingly giving these electors Safe Harbor status, but the state's 
governor does not certify this appointment. Instead, the state's legislature 
purports to override the state supreme court and appoint a different set of 
electors, and the governor certifies this legislatively appointed set. There 
is no pretense that the legislatively appointed electors have Safe Harbor 
status, but there is a question whether the legislative act deprives the state 
supreme court's decision of its authoritativeness under state law. What 
does 3 U.S.C. § 15 require in this instance? What if the House wants to 
count one set of electoral votes (those backed by the judicial decision), 
whereas the Senate wants to count the other set of electoral votes (those 
backed by the legislative act and the governor's certificate)? 
79. Id. at 633.  VP-R0000183_0051 
(2021-079) 
2019] Preparing for a Disputed Presidential Election 359 
Notwithstanding the debate between Siegel and Wroth-CRS, is this an 
instance where the governor's certificate controls, or instead that neither 
return can be counted ( or that the one backed by the judicial decision must 
count, notwithstanding the disagreement between the two chambers, 
because it is the only return capable of Safe Harbor status)? 
Second, prior to the Safe Harbor deadline the governor certifies the 
appointment of the state's electors after completion of the state's 
procedures for counting the state's popular vote, but after the Safe Harbor 
deadline has passed (but before the meeting of the state's electors), 
evidence is discovered that the previously certified result is incorrect 
(perhaps it was absentee ballot fraud, as in North Carolina's 
congressional district in 2018, or some form of foreign cyberattack, or 
some other cause). The state's supreme court overturns the previous 
certification and declares the opposing set of electors the true winner of 
the state's popular vote, and the governor certifies this new result. But 
Congress has received both gubernatorial certificates, and the party 
favored by the first one is arguing that it is the only valid one because it 
is the only one with Safe Harbor status. What does 3 U.S.C. § 15 require 
in this situation. And if the House and Senate disagree, what happens 
given that both returns have the governor's certificate? 
D. The Consequence of Not Counting Any Electoral Votes from a 
State? 
Suppose, because of a cyberattack or otherwise, it is determined 
pursuant to 3 U.S.C. § 15, that a state has failed to appoint any electors 
and therefore has not valid electoral votes to count. How is that state to 
be considered in the calculation of whether any candidate has won a 
"majority" of electoral votes, as required by the Twelfth Amendment? 
The amendment states: "the person having the greatest number of votes 
for President, shall be the President, if such number be a majority of the 
whole number of electors appointed." Normally, the number necessary 
for a majority is 270 because 538 is the total number of electors 
nationally. But if a state chose not to participate, then presumably its 
number would be subtracted. from the denominator of 538. Is the same 
true if the state wanted to participate but was prevented from doing so 
because of a cyberattack? What if the state thought it appointed electors, 
but there was a dispute about this appointment, with the consequence that 
Congress refused to count any electoral votes from the state? Is this latter 
situation the same as a cyberattack that prevents appointment, or different 
for purposes of calculating the Twelfth Amendment denominator? In 
other words, is this denominator issue a unitary one, or is it instead 
variable depending on the particular circumstances that causes problems 
with the appointment of a state's electors? And, relatedly, what if the  VP-R0000183_0052 
(2021-079) 
360 Loyola University Chicago Law Journal [Vol. 51 
Senate and House diverge on how to handle this issue; is there a 
mechanism for determining an answer in the event of a bicameral 
divergence on this point? · 
E. Completion or Incompletion of the Electoral Count? 
Given that 3 U.S.C. § 15 requires the counting process to consider one 
state at a time in alphabetical order, what happens if Congress appears to 
be stuck on a particular state (before any candidate has reached an 
indisputable majority of all electoral votes in the count)? Does the vice 
president of the United States, as President of the Senate and thus 
presiding officer over the special electoral count procedure under the 
Twelfth Amendment and 3 U.S.C. § 15, have constitutional or statutory 
authority to insist upon completion of the count in a timely manner 
(before noon on January 20), if the two chambers of Congress otherwise 
would remain mired in a dispute over a particular state? 
There are various provisions of the Electoral Count Act that endeavor 
to move the count along, so that it does not become stuck or bogged 
down. 3 U.S.C. § 15 itself provides: "When the two Houses have voted, 
they shall immediately again meet, and the presiding officer shall then 
announce the decision of the questions submitted." This provision seems 
to authorize the vice president to make some definitive pronouncements 
in light of disagreement between the two chambers. But the extent of the 
vice president's authority is unclear in this regard. And the very next ( and 
last) sentence of 3 U.S.C. § 15 arguably cuts against permitting the vice 
president to take up the next state if there are unresolved matters 
concerning the state under immediate consideration: "No votes or papers 
from any other State shall be acted upon until the objections previously 
made to the votes or papers from any State shall have been finally 
disposed of." 
The next section of the United States Code, 3 U.S.C. § 16, contains 
additional provisions designed to achieve a timely completion of the 
electoral count: 
Such joint meeting shall not be dissolved until the count of electoral 
votes shall be completed and the result declared; and no recess shall be 
taken unless a question shall have arisen in regard to counting any such 
votes, or otherwise under this subchapter, in which case it shall be 
competent for either House, acting separately, in the manner 
hereinbefore provided, to direct a recess of such House not beyond the 
next calendar day, Sunday excepted, at the hour of 10 o'clock in the 
forenoon. But if the counting of the electoral votes and the declaration 
of the result shall not have been completed before the fifth calendar day 
next after such first meeting of the two Houses, no further or other 
recess shall be taken by either House. 
And, in the same vein, the following section, 3 U.S.C. § 17, provides:  VP-R0000183_0053

2019) Preparing for a Disputed Presidential Election 
When the two Houses separate to decide upon an objection that may 
have been made to the counting of any electoral vote or votes from any 
State, or other question arising in the matter, each Senator and 
Representative may speak to such objection or question five minutes, 
and not more than once; but after such debate shall have lasted two 
hours it shall be the duty of the presiding officer of each House to put 
the main question without further debate. 
Perhaps most significantly, the next section, 3 U.S.C. § 19, states: 
While the two Houses shalI be in meeting as provided in this chapter, 
the President of the Senate shall have power to preserve order; and no 
debate shall be allowed and no question shall be put by the presiding 
officer except to either House on a motion to withdraw. 361 
This provision, more than any other, would seem to empower the vice 
president to move the proceedings along if they are stuck because of a 
disagreement between the Senate and the House. Even so, "the power to 
preserve order" is not exactly the same as the power to render a final and 
definitive judgment concerning a consequential dispute of statutory 
interpretation; and if the House of Representatives is insisting that the 
electoral votes of a state must be counted, while the Senate is insisting 
that that they must be rejected-and if 3 U.S.C. § 15 is itself unclear on 
the consequence of this dispute under the particular circumstances 
(perhaps it is the situation when both returns have the governor's 
certificate )--then is it clear that the vice president can unilaterally 
announce a position on the matter and insist upon moving on to the next 
state? If the House of Representatives refuses to move on to the next state, 
because it does not consider the previous state resolved (despite the vice 
president's pronouncement), is it part of the vice president's authority "to 
preserve order" to insist that the count continue with the next state? 
F. The Relevance of the Twentieth Amendment? 
The Twentieth Amendment seems to contemplate the possibility that 
the counting of electoral votes may be incomplete and thus there might 
be neither a president-elect nor a vice president elect at noon on January 
20, when the terms of the previous president and vice president expire, 
and thus there would need to be an acting president to be identified in a 
statute enacted by Congress: 
If a President shall not have been chosen before the time fixed for the 
beginning of his term, or if the President elect shall have failed to 
qualify, then the Vice President elect shall act as President until a 
President shall have qualified; and the Congress may by law provide for 
the case wherein neither a President elect nor a Vice President elect 
shall have qualified, declaring who shall then act as President, or the 
manner in which one who is to act shall be selected, and such person  VP-R0000183_0054 
(2021-079) 
362 Loyola University Chicago Law Journal [Vol. 51 
shall act accordingly until a President or Vice President shall have 
qualified. 
But what if there is a debate on whether or not the situation exists where 
"a President shall not have been chosen"? Suppose the House of 
Representatives thinks the electoral count remains incomplete because of 
an intractable dispute, and thus in its view the situation calls for an acting 
president until the dispute is resolved, whereas the outgoing vice 
president (before noon on January 20) believes that the electoral count 
has been brought to a conclusion despite the House's objection, and thus 
the declared president-elect is entitled to all the powers of the office 
starting at the beginning of the new term. Does the Constitution, properly 
interpreted, provide an answer on whether the situation is one involving 
an acting president, as the House contends, or a president-elect, as the 
outgoing vice president contends? 
Related, if there were to exist the situation at noon on January 20 of 
two simultaneous claims to the status of commander-in-chief--one from 
previously incumbent president claiming to have been declared re-elected 
by the outgoing vice president, and the other from the Speaker of the 
House claiming to assume the status of acting president given the House's 
declaration that there is no president-elect because the electoral count 
remains disputed and incomplete--do military officials, including those 
responsible for control of nuclear weapons, wishing to obey the lawful 
commander-in-chief know how to decide who is the lawful commander­
in-chief?
