Cindy just said that Park Service 
informed her that Kremer's pulled 
permit. So we should be good. In a 
measure of good faith, Alex is making 
apology on his show to them. 
I'm hoping EVERYONE is good now 
and can work together

Caroline, just seeing if there's any 
last-minute updates for tomorrow? 
Are there going to be any other 
speakers other than POTUS? What 
time do you recommend we get there, 
meaning VIPs? 
Caroline, 
Joe Flynn contacted me. The General 
and his group need 6 VIP passes. He 
also wants to join Roger, Alex etc in 
leading the March to the Capitol. How 
can we get them the VIP passes? 
He called me about an hour ago.
