Just an FYI. Alex Cannon and his team verified that the lOk+ supposed dead people 
voting in GA is not accurate  I didn't hear that claim. It is not accurate. I think I found 22 if I remember 
correctly. Two of them died just days before the general  It was alleged in Rudy's hearing today. Your number is much closer to what we can 
prove. I think it's 12  My son found 12 obituaries and 6 other possibles depending on the Voter roll acuracy  That sounds more like it. Maybe he can help Rudy find the other 10k ??  lol
