Dear Mark. .. I know the mayor sent this to you last evening, but just wanted to emphasize the importance of 
timing. We need to pull the trigger today, to have the impact that's needed in the states that we're targeting. 
We're estimating it's going to run between $5 to $8M ... and we will bring in Mike Glassner and Mark Serrano 
to put it together and push it out under the mayors supervision. With all due respect, we don't want the 
campaign comms people involved ... We need this to get done, done right, and done now. 
There is only one thing that's going to move the needle and force the legislators to do what their constitutionally 
obligated to do, and that is apply pressure ... specific pressure in targeted areas. This plan does exactly that, 
while educating the American people who will then apply pressure to make sure their legislators refuse to 
certify a fraudulent vote count. 
We can do all the investigations we want later, but if the president plans on winning, it's the legislators that 
have to be moved, and this will do just that. We're just running out of time. 
Thanks for your consideration. 
Strength and Honor, 
BERNARD B. KERIK 
Police Commissioner 
City of New York (Retired)
