2 Mr. - So the time is 4:01 p.m., and this is the transcribed interview of Scott 
3 Johnston conducted by the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the 
4 United States Capitol. This interview is being conducted pursuant to House Resolution 
5 503, and it's being conducted remotely via the Webex platform. 
6 My name is- and I'm an investigative counsel with the select 
7 committee. With me from the select committee staff are who's a senior 
8 investigative counsel. We're also joined by a couple of professional staff members: 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 and 
Although this is a staff-led deposition, members of the select committee may join 
if they choose, and if they do, they can ask questions. I don't know if any will join us 
today, but if they do, I'll pause and just acknowledge for the record that they've joined. 
Mr. Johnston, I just want to make clear for the record that you're participating in 
14 this interview voluntarily, which we appreciate. And I also want to make sure that we 
15 acknowledge for the record that you were advised of the option to have a lawyer present 
16 with you and ultimately have declined to have counsel with you here today. 
17 Is that correct? 
18 
19 Mr. Johnston. That is correct. 
Mr.- Okay. Just a few ground rules, logistics for the conversation we're 
20 going to have, just in terms of the transcription of it. The video feed, as you heard at the 
21 very beginning, is being recorded through the Webex platform, but the reporter's 
22 transcription writing down what we say is going to be the official record of the 
23 proceeding. 
24 We just ask to confirm that you are not recording the interview on your end. 
25 Mr. Johnston. I'm not recording the interview.  1 
2 
3 Mr.- And also confirm that no one else is present with you. 
Mr. Johnston. No one else is present with me. 
Mr.~ Thank you. Please wait until each question is completed before 
4 you begin to respond, and we will do our best to wait until your response is complete 
5 before we ask the next question. The reporter can't note nonverbal responses, such as 
6 shaking or nodding your head, so it's important that you respond to each question with 
7 an audible verbal response. 
8 We'd ask that you give answers to the best of your recollection, and if a question 
9 is unclear, please ask for clarification. If you don't know the answer, it's fine just to say 
10 so. 
11 And, finally, I remind you, as we remind all witnesses, that it is unlawful to 
12 deliberately provide false information to Congress and doing so could result in criminal 
13 penalties. 
14 Do you understand that? 
15 
16 Mr. Johnston. Yes, I do. 
Mr.- Wonderful. So I don't think we're going to take a long time today, 4 
17 but if at any point you want to take a break, stretch your legs, get a drink of water, we can 
18 accommodate that. Just say so and we can pause. But otherwise, unless you have any 
19 questions, we can plunge right in. 
20 Mr. Johnston. No, I think we're good. Do you need me to mute myself each 
21 time when I'm not talking, or is there not much background noise there if I leave it off 
22 mute? 
23 Mr.. I can hear you just fine. I don't think there's any technical issues, 
24 and if there's something that's going on, somebody can pop up and let us know, but I 
25 think for now we're good the way it is.  1

12 Mr. Johnston. Perfect. 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q EXAMINATION 
So, Mr. Johnston, could you please state your full legal name? 
Scott Robert Johnston. 
And in what city and State do you currently live? 
My legal residence is in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. 
And is that where you currently are now? 
No. 
Where are you now? 
Currently, I am in Mexico. 
Okay. And so help me understand that. You seemed to make a point to 
13 say legal residence in Sioux Falls. Are you in Mexico on vacation, long term? What 
14 brings you to Mexico? 5 
15 A Currently here throughout the summer. I'm a constant traveler. So South 
16 Dakota recognizes full-time nomad status in order to give you residency in a State. 
17 Q Okay. So a resident of South Dakota, but indefinitely in Mexico. Is that 
18 safe to say? 
19 A Not indefinitely, but for the next few months, yeah. Few months, few 
20 weeks, yeah. 
21 Q Where did you consider yourself to live between November 2020 and 
22 January 2021? 
23 
24 A 
Q Mesa, Arizona. 
And I'm not going to put your full phone number on the record, but I just 
25 want to confirm that you have a cell phone with  1 
2 Is that correct? 
A That is correct. 
3 Q And is that the phone number you were using between November 2020 and 
4 January 2021? 
5 
6 A 
Q 
7 period? 
8 
9 A 
Q Yes. 
Were there any other phone numbers that you were using during that time 
On a personal basis, no. 
Okay. Now, you and I previously spoke in December of 2021. Do you 
10 remember that? 
11 
12 A 
Q Yes, I do. 
And during that interview, we discussed how you came to participate in the 
13 Women for America First bus tour in late 2020. 
14 Do you remember that? 
Yes, I do. 6 
15 
16 A 
Q So I just want to confirm that I have some of the basic details of that correct. 
17 If I remember correctly, your first interactions with Women for America First came when 
18 you were invited by Dustin Stockton and Jennifer Lawrence to attend a November 14, 
19 2020, event in Washington, D.C. 
20 Is that right? 
21 
22 A 
Q That is correct, at the Supreme Court. 
Now, can you tell us briefly what the basis of your acquaintance with 
23 Mr. Stockton and Ms. Lawrence is? 
24 A I have known them and stayed in contact through them throughout the 
25 years when they worked with the campaign in the State of Arizona for Kelli Ward when  1 she was running for U.S. Senate. And we became friends at that point in time. 
2 
3 
4 Q 
A 
Q Do you remember about what year that was? 
2016, I believe. 2015, 2016. 
Now, before November of 2020, had you ever met or interacted with Amy 
5 Kremer or Kylie Kremer? 
6 
7 A 
Q I didn't even know who they were. Never heard of them. 
So safe to say the first time you met or interacted with them was at this 
8 November 14th event in Washington, D.C.? 
9 
10 A 
Q That is correct. 
Now, following that, I understand from our previous conversation that you 
11 were asked by the Kremers to join them on their March for Trump bus tour. Is that 
12 right? 
13 
14 A 
Q By Dustin Stockton, yes. Dustin and Jennifer. 
Okay. So explain to us what that request was and how you came to be on 
15 the bus tour following the D.C. event at the Supreme Court? 
16 A Just a simple, hey, they're organizing a bus tour that we were talking about, 
17 that they were talking about after the Supreme Court rally: Would you like to join us? 
18 We know you've got some free time right now from work or your schedule is more open; 
19 you're working remotely. Would you like to come with us? 
And I said: Sure, why not? It's something to do. 7 
20 
21 
22 Q 
A And so what did you understand you were going to be doing on the tour? 
My understanding of why I was officially brought on was Dustin needed help 
23 just doing simple administrative tasks or, you know, having some sort of assistant to kind 
24 of help him with whatever --whatever he needed done, you know, running simple 
25 errands for him or other tasks.  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q And were you expecting to be paid for your role? 
I was not. 
Did you expect to be reimbursed for expenses that you incurred? 
I was reimbursed for expenses that were incurred. 
Now, following the bus tour, did you ask for payment for the services that 
6 you provided? 
7 A I was told --to clarify the payment question, I was told in the middle of the 
8 tour, after the rallies in December, that they would pay me a thousand dollars a week to 
9 continue on the tour with them, and they would go back to the beginning. I said: 
10 That's great, go ahead, you know. 
11 And they never --they never made that payment. So it was --I was totally 
12 volunteer. 
13 Q And when you say you were told that you'd be paid a thousand dollars a 
14 week to stay on the tour, who told you that? 
15 A Dustin told me, and then Kylie had also mentioned --Kylie Kremer had 
16 mentioned it multiple times. 
17 Q And did anyone ever explain to you why you were not ultimately paid for 
18 your services? 
19 A My understanding is there was some sort of disagreement with Dustin and 
20 Amy, with the Kremers in general, I guess you could say. So, therefore, they were 
21 withholding payment to me, trying to use that as leverage. 
22 Q Now, did you know whether Dustin and Jennifer were expecting to be 
23 compensated for their assistance on the bus tour? 
I don't know what their agreement was, no. 8 
24 
25 A 
Q But what was the basis then of the dispute between Dustin and the Kremers  9 
1 that your, for lack of a better way of putting it, compensation kind of became the sacrifice 
2 over? 
3 
4 A 
Q I don't recall the exact --the exact issue. 
Okay. But just to put a pin on it, you thought you were going to be paid a 
5 thousand dollars a week to stay on the bus tour into late December, and then later on a 
6 conflict arose between Dustin and the Kremers and the Kremers ultimately decided not to 
7 pay you anything? 
8 
9 A 
Q That is correct. 
Now, when you were on the bus tour, did you spend time on the bus riding 
10 around? Were there additional vehicles? How were you getting around? 
11 A So I was on the bus less than a handful of times when it was moving. I got 
12 around either in a pickup that they had that was towing a U-Haul a lot of the time at the 
13 beginning of the tour. And then towards middle to end of --middle of the tour I would 
14 say is when I was transferred into a Suburban with another gentleman by the name of 
15 Matt Mccleskey and did most of the driving at that point. 
16 Q Now, if I remember from our conversation back in December, I think you 
17 said that you joined the tour shortly after Thanksgiving in Florida. Is that right? 
18 
19 A 
Q Black Friday, yep, is when I flew out to Miami. 
So were you continuously with the group from Black Friday through January 
20 6th, or was there a period where it stopped and you went home or was it --tell us about 
21 that. 
22 A I was continually with somebody from the group, yes. So there was a time 
23 period when they had driven back or they were going back from D.C. to Las Vegas, or the 
24 West Coast, that myself and Matt Mccleskey flew to Phoenix and then stayed at my 
25 house for a couple days.  And about what time was that that you were in Phoenix? 
I can look it up. Can I get my phone? 
Sure. 10 
1 
2 
3 
4 Q 
A 
Q 
A Let's see here. It's not showing in the email with the reservation, so let me 
5 just give a ballpark on there. It would have been --it was right before Christmas. So 
6 I'm going to say that it was right around December 18th, 19th. 
7 Q So that's helpful. So were you with the March for Trump bus tour on 
8 Christmas? 
A Yes, I was. 9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 Q This might be a helpful time for us to pull up what we have as an itinerary. 
1111, are you able to pull up exhibit 1? 
A 
Q 
A 
Q December 16th is when I flew out. I just found the date. 
December 16th is when you flew --
To Phoenix from D.C. 
Okay. And so that would have been following the December 12th event in 
16 Washington, D.C.? 
17 
18 A 
Q 
19 Johnston? 
20 
21 A 
Q That is correct. 
So you can see this is marked as exhibit 1. Can you see that okay, Mr. 
Yes, I can. 
So this is an email that was produced by Kylie Jane Kremer. And if we scroll 
22 down, what this is, is it's forwarding an itinerary as of about December 27th for this 
23 March for Trump bus tour. And you can see here it starts around Christmas, actually 
24 December 26th, the day after. And it says here the team arrives in Las Vegas. 
25 And then you can see here that their I think RON is the abbreviation they're using  11 
1 about where they're going to stay the night for a hotel. Trump Las Vegas. And you can 
2 see, according to this document, December 27th, there's a bus call in the afternoon to 
3 leave Las Vegas to drive to Pasadena, California. And, along the way, there's events you 
4 can see here that they're saying they're going to have. So 7 p.m., on December 27th, an 
5 event in Pasadena, California. Depart that event about an hour and a half later, and 
6 then stay at a Westin in Pasadena the night of the 27th. 
7 Then you can see, the next day, the 28th, according to this schedule, leave 
8 Pasadena midmorning; stopping at --in Ventura, California; driving another couple of 
9 hours to Huntington Beach, California, for an event at 3 o'clock; a couple hours later, 
10 drive to Palm Desert. 
11 And if we scroll down a little bit further here, on the night of the 28th, arriving in 
12 Cathedral City, California, which I understand to be the area of Palm Springs, staying at a 
13 DoubleTree Palm Springs? 
14 And the next day, December 29th, leaving that morning from Palm Desert to drive 
15 to Phoenix and then Las Cruces overnight, and then ultimately ending up in Texas at the 
16 border wall on Sunland Park on December 30, 2020. 
17 Mr. Johnston, to the best of your knowledge, is that itinerary accurate for the 
18 stops that the bus tour went to during this time period? 
19 A Can you scroll back up to the 28th on there for me? So we have Palm 
20 Desert. The 29th is inaccurate. We were in El Paso. So not too far from Las Cruces. 
21 So they deviated a little bit from that. That appears to be the proper address of the 
22 DoubleTree. I'd have to double-check it, but it does look accurate. 
23 Q So I guess then, from a bigger picture perspective, were you with the bus 
24 tour as it went from Las Vegas to El Paso? 
25 A The majority of the time, yes. We were on the same route. Were we  1 right behind the bus? No. 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q But you were participating -­
Yes. 
You were playing the role as a driver for the tour during this time period? 
Yes. 
Okay. Now, and the reason I wanted to draw that out is because, 
7 obviously, you know one of the reasons that we spoke --we've been interested in 
8 speaking with you is because of this discussion of prepaid telephones on this bus tour, 
9 you know, sometimes called burner phones. And I'm happy to use whatever 
10 terminology you like. 12 
11 But we just want to go through the details of as much as you can tell us about this 
12 specific sort of moment in time, because I understand that you had a pretty specific 
13 recollection of this to Rolling Stone when you've been interviewed by them, but one of 
14 the reasons I wanted to put this itinerary in front of you was, if it's generally accurate, 
15 trying to place exactly when during this stretch of the tour this burner phone transaction 
16 and any conversations on these phones may have happened. 
17 So, if you could, why don't you start by just telling us in as much detail as you 
18 remember, and then I'll ask followups, as needed. 
19 A Okay. So, on Monday, the 28th, is when I had Kylie Kremer in the vehicle 
20 from Pasadena on. We did not --I did not attend, and we didn't drive to the other 
21 events that were in Huntington Beach and wherever else they had them that day. 
22 Kylie rode in the --we first had a different rental vehicle, which we had to go swap 
23 out. And we swapped that out at the --I believe it was the Ontario Airport in California. 
24 I'd have to double-check on their --those records. Swapped out a vehicle because Amy 
25 had to have a Suburban or a Tahoe. She couldn't have a minivan.  13 
1 So we swapped those out. Kylie was there in the vehicle. That's when she was 
2 discussing, you know, how events were going to unfold and how there was going to be 
3 something with the former President Trump on January 6th at that point in time. 
4 It was once we arrived in Pasadena ahead of the group that Matt Mccleskey and I 
5 went and checked the entire group in, started getting things ready, credit card 
6 authorizations and such like that signed for the hotel and everyone's name on a room. 
7 And that --
8 
9 
10 Q 
A 
Q Can I pause you right there? 
Yes. 
So you've mentioned --I just want to make sure that we've got this straight. 
11 So you said arrived in Pasadena on the 28th? 
12 A Palm Springs on the 28th. 
13 
14 Q 
A Okay. 
We left Pasadena on the 28th. 
15 Q Got you. Okay. So you were in Pasadena on the night of the 27th, and 
16 then, the morning of the 28th, you left Pasadena to go to Palm Springs? 
17 
18 
19 A 
Q 
A That is correct. 
Okay. Sorry for interrupting. Go ahead. 
No apologies needed. 
20 So it was at that point, once we got to Palm Springs, Cathedral City, whatever 
21 jurisdiction it was at that point, is when Kylie had asked me and started talking about 
22 prepaid burner cell phones, whatever we want to call them. 
23 And, you know, she had a few questions about where you could purchase them 
24 and if I knew anything about it. And that's when we started talking, and I said: I can 
25 run over and grab them.  1 
2 And then she asked if I would purchase them for them. 
Q Okay. So what time of day was that conversation with Ms. Kremer about 
3 the burner phones on December 28? 
4 
5 
6 A 
Q 
A Late --late-early afternoon. I'd say between 1 to 3ish, 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. 
And it was after you already arrived in the Palm Springs area? 
That's correct, yes. Because we had to pick up another gal, Katie Kegel, 
7 who had flown into the area. 
8 Q Was this before or after checking into the DoubleTree Hotel? 14 
9 A During, because intermittently we were back and forth to the vehicle parked 
10 at the DoubleTree. 
11 Q And so the conversation is taking place in a car, in the hotel room? Where 
12 is that conversation taking place? 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A In the car. In the vehicle. 
And so she --I mean, do you remember specifically what she said? 
That she needed a way of communicating with top-level officials. 
Did she say what that meant? 
She had said with people from the White House, just top-level officials. 
18 That's --1 didn't ask further questions from there. 
19 Q Did she say why she needed some kind of method of communicating with 
20 them other than her own phone? 
21 A She was always afraid that somebody was listening in or following and had 
22 some sort of paranoia throughout the entire trip. So I assumed that it was linked to that 
23 somehow. 
24 Q So, when you say she was always afraid of someone listening in, how was 
25 that conveyed to you?  15 
1 A It was conveyed by multiple people on the tour that, you know, we're being 
2 watched by many people, and your phone calls can be being listened to, just kind of a 
3 conspiracy theorist type of motto. 
4 Q Now, before the burner phones came up, how many phones was Ms. Kremer 
5 using, Kylie Kremer? 
6 
7 A 
Q To my knowledge, one. 
And you produced to us a screenshot that you had from a conversation with 
8 her. Was that conversation taking place on the one phone that you knew of at the time 
9 that she had been using? 
10 
11 A 
Q Yes. 
So was anybody else there with you when she's having this conversation 
12 about the burner phones? 
13 A Matt Mccleskey was in and out of the vehicle. He was running back and 
14 forth handling something with the front desk of the hotel. 
15 
16 Q 
A To the best of your knowledge, did he hear her making these requests? 
To my knowledge, I --1 don't know. He was constantly when he was in the 
17 vehicle either doing a conference call or had his headphones on at that point in time. 
18 I do know when Kylie asked about the burner phones, Katie Kegel was inside using 
19 the restroom. So it was just Kylie and I in the vehicle for the majority of the time. 
20 believe that Matt was there because he did have a work call that he had to take. 
21 Q But Mr. Mccleskey didn't want to --he didn't participate in that 
22 conversation, did he? 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A He did not. 
Do you still have the phone number that you had for Ms. Kremer? 
Her personal number that we would text on and communicate on?  1 
2 
3 
4 Q 
A 
Q 
A Yes, yes. 
Yes, I do. 
Could you tell me what number you have for her? 
I can. Amy Kremer, I have 
5 Q But you said this conversation was with Kylie Kremer, correct? 
6 A That's correct. 
7 Q So what's the number you have for Kylie Kremer? 
8 A Kylie Jane Kremer, I have area code 
9 Q So you're in the parking lot of the DoubleTree Hotel during the check-in 
10 process. She's asking you about these methods of trying to find a different way to 16 
11 communicate with top-level officials, and you --I don't want to put words in your mouth. 
12 You suggested, you offered. How did the conversation move towards actually going and 
13 getting phones? 
14 A She had asked about burner phones or some sort of other communication 
15 which could be purchased or used. 
16 Q Okay. And so then walk me through then how the conversation goes from 
17 her asking generally "how can I have a secure conversation" to you going and purchasing 
18 phones. 
19 A She had asked what I knew about prepaid cell phones or if I knew anything 
20 about them. I had said: I've had a prepaid SIM card in the past when I've traveled. 
21 So I have --I keep a separate phone that's unlocked for when I'm out of the country or in 
22 an area that I would have to pay for, you know, roaming charges. So you get a local --a 
23 local SIM card with local service on there for the time that you're there. 
24 And then she kind of asked how that had worked. And then she'd asked about 
25 how burner phones would work in the United States, how you would purchase them, and  17 
1 how she could go about getting those. We went over aspects of it. Then she even 
2 asked me down to the point of it would be --you know: We should do that. We 
3 should get some because we're in California, and California has very strict privacy laws. 
4 That was even discussed. 
5 And I said: I'm not an attorney so I wouldn't know. But from my years of being 
6 in a call center and such like that, I said: You're right, California does have very strict call 
7 recording and privacy laws is my understanding. 
8 
9 Q 
A So then did she ask you to go buy prepaid phones? 
It was at that point she asked if I would be comfortable purchasing phones 
10 for them. And I said: Sure. That's fine. 
11 Q And so did you go do that immediately? When did you go, you know, buy 
12 the phones for her? 
13 A Very shortly after, right as the bus was --right after they had arrived is when 
14 I went over there to the CVS that was on the corner by the DoubleTree. 
15 
16 
17 Q 
A 
Q Okay. So about what time of day do you think that was? 
Between I'd say 3 to Sish, 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. 
And did you use your own money? Was money given to you? How were 
18 the phones to be purchased? 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A She gave me cash and said it was of the utmost importance to use cash. 
How much cash did she give you? 
$300. 
Was there any discussion about how much the phones were going to cost? 
I had --she had asked me if I knew how much they would be, and I said I 
24 assumed they would be under $100 each. 
25 Q And why --did she say why it was of the utmost importance that the  18 
1 purchase be made with cash? 
2 A She didn't want to be tracked or anyone to know. She'd made that clear, 
3 the reason she was getting them was to stay --fly under the radar. 
4 Q I mean, did you say to her: Well, you know, if I buy them, it will be just my 
5 own card purchasing them, it's not linked back to Kylie Jane Kremer? 
6 A I didn't even have that discussion with her because it was hard enough to get 
7 reimbursements from them, that if they're giving you the cash at that point, take it and 
8 not have to worry about getting reimbursed. 
9 Q Okay. So you take the $300 cash with the instructions to go buy --it was 
10 three phones. Is that right? 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 A That's correct. 
Q Did she say why three phones? 
A She did not. 
Q And did she say anything about what kind of phones they needed to be? 
A She said some that you can make phone calls on and easily text, which that's 
16 pretty much any phone nowadays. 
17 Q And so then you --I think you said it was on the corner across from the 
18 DoubleTree Hotel. Is that right? 
19 
20 
21 
22 A That is correct. 
Q All right. We have a map that we've pulled. 
_, if you could put up exhibit 2. 
So I can tell you, Mr. Johnston, that from the itinerary we were just looking 
23 at --we can scroll down a little,., so you can see the --there you go. Perfect. 
24 The itinerary we looked at from the Women for America First bus tour identified 
25 on the evening of December 28 this specific DoubleTree Hotel in Cathedral City,  19 
1 California. And according to Google Maps, across the street, catty-corner really across 
2 from where the DoubleTree is, is a CVS store. It's store No. 1520, according to CVS' 
3 website. 
4 Is that the location where you went to go buy the phones? 
5 
6 A The address that I have if you can zoom in, I have 68010 Vista Chino. Yes. 
Q Well, we put together this map, but I can tell you that that is the street 
7 address for the store that we have highlighted there. So did you walk over there? Did 
8 you drive over there? How did you get over to the CVS store? 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 A Walked over. 
Q Was anybody else with you? 
A No. 
Q And what kinds of phones did you buy? 
A 
Q They were of an Android model. I couldn't even tell you the brand name. 
Do you remember --well, when you buy a prepaid phone, does it tell you 
15 what the area code is going to be on it? 
16 A So, when you buy it, you buy a SIM card with service that you can pop into it. 
17 So you buy three SIM cards, three phones. How they activated the service at that point, 
18 that was up to them. I did not help them activate the service or anything at that point. 
19 The service was prepaid, and the phone was purchased to where you can just put the SIM 
20 card in it. 
21 Q Okay. So the net --that's sort of betraying my own lack of personal 
22 experience having purchased any prepaid phones. 
23 When you go and buy a prepaid phone, does it all come in like a single box that's 
24 the phone and the SIM card, or do you have to buy the phone separate from the SIM 
25 card? How does that work?  20 
1 A Separately. So you buy the phone, and then you buy the SIM card. 
2 Oftentimes, there's multiple providers that you can choose the service from or the level 
3 of service in which you're looking at for amount of data and minutes, et cetera. 
4 Q Okay. So then, for this purchase of three phones, you had to buy three 
5 prepaid phones and three SIM cards? 
A That is correct. 6 
7 Q Were there any other items that you included in the purchase beyond those 
8 three phones and three SIM cards? 
A 9 No, 
14 
15 
16 more? Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q And you paid with cash? 
That is correct. 
Do you remember how much the transaction was ultimately for? 
I believe there was about 30 or 40 dollars change. 
Okay. So somewhere in the neighborhood of $250, maybe a little bit 
And when --you and I spoke on the phone a week and a half ago now, do 
18 you remember that? 
19 
20 A You and I. Yes, I believe so. 
Q Well, I'm just --I want to --I just want to make sure that you remember. 
21 think when we spoke on the phone a week and a half ago or so, you had mentioned to 
22 me that, although this was a cash purchase, that you frequently when you go to a CVS will 
23 type in your phone number or use like a card --
24 
25 A Yes. 
Q --to scan for points. Does that refresh your recollection about talking  21 
1 about that? 
A Yes, okay. Yeah. So -- 2 
3 Q So, for this purchase on December 28th, did you use a CVS account or put in 
4 your phone number for --I have one on my own key chain. I think it's called a CVS Extra 
5 Care card, if that sounds familiar to you. 
6 Did you do anything like that for this transaction? 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 A I believe I might have, yes. 
Q But you're not sure if you did? 
A I can't recall. 
Q Did you get a receipt for the purchase? 
A I did. 
Q And what did you do with that receipt? 
A Gave it to Kylie. 
Q Did she ask for the change back? 
A Yes, she did. 
Q And, after that, did she ask for your assistance getting the phones set up? 
A She did. And I said: All the instructions are there. Let me know if you 
18 have questions. 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 Q Did she have questions after that? 
A She did not. 
Q And did she say who the phones were for? 
A She did not. 
Q When was the --when you gave the phones to her, was that immediately 
24 after having made the purchase, or was it later on the next day? When was it that you 
25 were handing these phones back?  1 
2 
3 A Immediately. 
Q And where was that? 
A After --we were at the --when I handed her the phones? She was still in 
4 the vehicle at the DoubleTree. 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 Q In the parking lot at the DoubleTree Hotel? 
A That is correct. 
Q Now, do you remember where you stayed that night? 
A I do. 
Q Where is that? 
A I stayed at the Triada Palm Springs, T-r-i-a-d-a. 
Q And do you know, was there a reason why you weren't staying at the 
12 DoubleTree Hotel? 22 
13 A They didn't have enough rooms for the amount of people that we needed to 
14 add on there, due to some COVID restrictions and occupancy stuff going on at that time. 
15 
16 
17 Q And do you know where Kylie Kremer stayed that night? 
A Triada. 
Q Okay. So my next question then is, when did you see --when did you next 
18 see these prepaid phones after you gave them back to Kylie? 
19 A On the drive through --through the desert on the way to Arizona the next 
20 day. So that would have been the 29th. 
21 Q Did anybody else, at least to your knowledge while you were on the tour, 
22 see the prepaid phones? 
23 A I would have --I would assume that multiple people had them. She was 
24 constantly carrying around two phones in her hand. Whether anyone actually noticed, 
25 with how busy they were, was that vigilant to observe it, I don't know.  1 
2 Q 
A So did you get the phone numbers to any of these phones? 
That's something that Kylie or whomever registered the SIM card would 
3 have had to have gotten at that point. So, no, I never had the phone numbers. 23 
4 Q But --and we're going to get to it. I think you said that you saw Kylie using 
5 the prepaid phone or one of the prepaid phones. Did you ever see anyone else on the 
6 tour using one of the prepaid phones that you purchased? 
7 
8 A 
Q No, sir. 
Now, Dustin and Jennifer, to the best of your knowledge, did they ever see 
9 the prepaid phones being used? 
10 A I can't recall if they saw them or not. To the best of my knowledge, I would 
11 say that possibly. 
12 
13 
14 Q 
A 
Q 
15 from you? 
16 
17 A 
Q But they weren't with you when you purchased the phones, right? 
They were not. 
And they weren't with you when Kylie asked for it or received the phones 
That is correct. 
And they weren't in the car with you when you were driving Kylie Kremer 
18 from the Palm Springs area to New Mexico and Texas the next day? 
19 
20 A 
Q That is correct. 
Okay. But you didn't have anything to do with the activation of the 
21 phones. You don't know the phone numbers themselves. You don't even have the 
22 area code. Is that right? 
23 A That is correct. 
24 Q Now, I want to talk about the media reporting on this, just to confirm some 
25 of the details that were there. And we have the articles; we can pull them up if you  24 
1 need to, but I'll just tell you some of the things the articles say and you can tell me if you 
2 were accurately quoted or if you were the source for that information. 
3 So, on November 23rd of last year, Rolling Stone published an article titled 
4 "January 6th organizers used anonymous burner phones to communicate with White 
5 House and Trump family, sources say." And the article describes information from three 
6 sources who were on the bus tour, including someone who said that Kylie Kremer 
7 directed an aide to pick up three burner phones days before January 6th. 
8 You were one of those three sources, right? 
9 
10 
11 right? 
12 
13 A 
Q 
A 
Q That is correct. 
And the other two sources were Dustin Stockton and Jennifer Lawrence, 
I can assume so. 
Well, did they --did Dustin or Jennifer tell you that they spoke to Hunter 
14 Walker from Rolling Stone? 
15 
16 A 
Q They did. 
Did anyone else from the bus tour tell you that they spoke to Hunter Walker 
17 from Rolling Stone? 
18 
19 A 
Q No. 
Now, in general, the article contains information that's basically the gist of 
20 what we went over, including that, according to sources that spoke to this journalist, that 
21 Kylie took one phone and another phone went to Amy. 
22 Do you know whether one of the phones went to Amy Kremer? 
23 A It very well could have. You know, that's been what I've thought where it 
24 went, but I have --I never saw Amy with one, no. 
25 Q Okay. So it was --if you said that, it would have just been speculation that  1 one went to Amy, because of how close she was with Kylie. Is that fair? 
2 
3 A 
Q That's correct. 
And also that Kylie said that she needed phones to communicate with 
4 high-level people. That's consistent with what you've said today, I think. This 
5 happened in the Palm Springs area. One quote from this article says that Kylie, quote, 
6 "talked with Mark Meadows on her personal phone once but mainly on the burner 
7 phone," unquote. 
8 Do you know what the basis of that quote is? 
Can you elaborate more what you're looking for for that one? 25 
9 
10 A 
Q Yeah. Well, so are you the source of that information? Did you hear Kylie 
11 Kremer talking on her personal phone with Mark Meadows? 
12 
13 
14 A 
Q 
A Whom she told --whom she had said was Mark Meadows, yes. 
Okay. Tell me why you're being specific about your wording on that. 
I don't know Mark Meadows from Adam. So I wouldn't know what his 
15 voice sounds like or anything else to that extent. I was going based upon what Kylie had 
16 said whom she was talking with. 
17 Q And so this was a phone conversation that --was that on speaker phone that 
18 you could hear another voice, or was it a private conversation that she later on told you 
19 was with Mark Meadows? 
20 A No, it was on speaker phone. Kylie was constantly doing things on speaker 
21 phone. 
22 Q And was there something about the phone call itself that you understood it 
23 to be with Mark Meadows, or was it only after the fact that she said, "Hey, that was Mark 
24 Meadows"? 
25 A After the fact that she had said it was Mark Meadows.  26 
1 Q And so tell me then about what that conversation entailed, to the best of 
2 your recollection. 
3 A So the beginning of the phone conversation, I believe she had mentioned, 
4 "Hey, be super quiet; it's the White House calling," something to that extent. 
5 During that conversation, they discussed how they were going to be holding an 
6 event on January 6th with the President being there and that they'd like to work out 
7 some of the details. And that's pretty much where that conversation went at that point. 
8 
9 
10 Q 
A 
Q And so was there anyone else on that call? 
Katrina Pierson was on one of the calls that she was on as well. 
And then help me understand the timing of this, to the best of your 
11 recollection. Was this the day after Palm Springs or the following day? Do you 
12 remember where you were on the road as this call is happening? 
13 A We were Arizona-California border on 1-10 there. Where exactly at that 
14 point, I couldn't tell you. You know, I think we were outside of just literally barren 
15 desert of California. I'm even trying to think of a --think of a city that's there. There's 
16 not too much there. And that's --that's where they had happened, because it was 
17 constantly going in and out, the signal. 
18 Q So, based on the itinerary that we were looking at, I think, if I'm 
19 remembering correctly, 28th is leaving Pasadena, staying in Palm Springs area. The next 
20 day, 29th, is leaving Palm Springs and driving west. The 29th was an overnight drive to 
21 Texas. 
22 So maybe this is on the 29th is when you think this conversation happened with 
23 someone from the White House and Katrina Pierson? 
24 A Oh, it was definitely that day, because it was before we arrived in Arizona, 
25 because she took the phone call with the National Park Service and their attorney, Mike  27 
1 Yoder, at the Arizona State Capitol. 
2 Q And so this conversation with the White House and Katrina Pierson 
3 happened before that conversation with the Park Service? 
That is correct. 4 
5 A 
Q Now, later on, in March of this year, March 20th, Hunter Walker from Rolling 
6 Stone wrote another article following up on some of the reporting from before. The 
7 title is "Exclusive: Witness claims Trump's chief of staff was on phone call planning 
8 January 6th march on the Capitol." 
9 And, in this article, information is attributed to you by name. Are you familiar 
10 with that article? 
11 
12 A 
Q Yes, sir. 
Actually, I should have asked you. I mean, to the best of your knowledge, 
13 the article that we were talking about when you were an anonymous source from last 
14 November, did you read that article? 
15 
16 A 
Q Yes, I did. 
And, when you read it, was there anything that stood out to you as being 
17 factually inaccurate, to the best of your knowledge? 
18 A I have not read it since the time it came out, but at that point in time, it did 
19 appear to be accurate. 
20 Q Okay. So, in other words, there's nothing that, when you read it after it 
21 came out, you thought "that's not exactly how I remember it"? 
22 
23 A 
Q Not that I can recall, no. 
Okay. So then, March 20th of this year, now you're being attributed by 
24 name, and much of it is reinforcing some of the information that you previously had 
25 provided to Rolling Stone, I think. But I just want to confirm a few things about what  28 
1 you told Rolling Stone. 
2 Did you tell Rolling Stone that leaders in the Trump administration had 
3 deliberately planned to have crowds converge on the Capitol to make it look like they had 
4 gone there on their own? 
5 A "To make it look like they had gone there on their own" was a comment that 
6 Kylie Kremer had made. 
7 Q Okay. Tell me more about that comment. How do you know that's what 
8 Kylie said? 
9 A She was on the phone with another man and another woman whom she 
10 attributed to be Mark Meadows and Katrina Pierson. So I directly overheard that 
11 conversation while in the call --in the car. 
12 Q 
13 phone? 
14 
15 
16 
17 A 
Q 
A 
Q Is this the same conversation that we've just been talking about on speaker 
Yes. 
And was that on her personal phone or on one of the burner phones? 
It switched from her personal phone to one of the burner prepaid phones. 
How did that --tell me more about that. What do you remember about 
18 there being a switch from one phone to another? 
19 A Kylie had said, "Let me take this offline," and then switched phones. Who 
20 called whom I can't recall at that point, but I know that's when it switched. 
21 Q I'm glad you mention that. The first call before Kylie says "Let's take this 
22 offline," do you know who initiated that call? 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A It rang in, because she had said: Be quiet, this is the White House calling. 
And, when she answered, it was both a man and a woman speaking? 
That is correct.  1 
2 
3 Q 
A 
Q And it was only those two voices on the call? 
To my recollection, yes. 
And it was after the fact that she represented to you that the woman was 
4 Katrina Pierson and the man was Mark Meadows? 
5 
6 A 
Q That is correct. 
Now, did you tell Rolling Stone that the organizers were constantly using 
7 burner phones? 29 
8 A I would have to re-read the article, but I said something to the effect of that, 
9 yes. 
10 Q So tell me more, then, about what your sense is of the frequency of the use 
11 of those burner phones during this time period. 
12 A In December or what time period? Leading up to January 6th? In 
13 general? What time period are you looking at? 
14 Q Well, from --as far as I understood it, there's no burner phones before you 
15 bought them in Palm Springs. Is that right? 
16 
17 A 
Q That's my understanding. 
Okay. And so we're really talking just about from this December 28th until 
18 January 6th. So tell me about your --what you remember seeing, perceiving about the 
19 use of burner phones during that limited window of time. 
20 A So the limited window of time that I actually saw Kylie with one of the 
21 burner phones was from the time that they were purchased and given to her, the next 
22 day in the vehicle, on our way to El Paso, where we stayed. And she left from El Paso to 
23 Washington, D.C. 
24 So I did not see Kylie again until we arrived in D.C. So how she was 
25 communicating at that point, I --I wouldn't know. She was communicating to the group  1 on her personal phone and texting everyone as well. 
2 Q Okay. Did you ever see --and maybe I asked this before. Did you ever 
3 see Amy Kremer using a prepaid phone? 
4 
5 
6 
7 A 
Q 
A 
Q Not to my recollection, no. 
And did you ever see Amy's partner, James Lyle, using a prepaid phone? 
Not to my recollection. 
Okay. And I ask because I think that those are the other two individuals 30 
8 that are --I don't know if it's implied or stated in one of the Rolling Stone articles as being 
9 the other two users of these three prepaid phones. So I'm just curious about --
10 
11 A 
Q That's been my speculation as well. 
Okay. So, to the extent you may have said something about Amy and 
12 James using prepaid phones, it's based on speculation, not firsthand observation? 
13 
14 A 
Q That's correct. 
And then, again, to go back to the best of what you know. I know I can't 
15 ask you to tell me what other people know. But, to the best of your knowledge, what 
16 did Dustin or Jennifer see or hear regarding these phones? In other words, did you tell 
17 Dustin and Jennifer about these prepaid phones during this period, December 28 through 
18 January 6th? 
19 A To my knowledge, yes, because we were pretty close. I didn't say --I just 
20 said she needed them to communicate with top-level officials, the same thing that Kylie 
21 had told me. I didn't tell them that they were going to be holding an event at the 
22 Ellipse, because Kylie had said that nobody else can know. They'll announce that shortly 
23 to the rest of the group. They didn't want everyone to start talking about what could be 
24 going on. 
25 Q Okay. Did Dustin or Jennifer ever say anything back to you about  1 confirming they saw or independently heard about the prepaid phones? 
2 
3 
4 A 
Q 
A That I purchased them or that their phones existed? 
Just that the phones existed. 
Since that time, they have, that they've known that I purchased them and 
5 they believe that they recall seeing them, yes. 
6 Q Yeah. I guess what I'm trying to get at, just to be straightforward, is I'm 
7 trying to understand to what extent Dustin and Jennifer have knowledge of the phones 
8 separate from what you told them. Does that make sense? 
9 
10 A 
Q Right. You'd have to ask them what their knowledge is on that. 
So they didn't say anything to you that you can remember that indicated 
11 they had some kind of separate knowledge? 
12 A No, not beyond what --that I had told them that they were purchased, no. 31 
13 Q Now, the same question about the earlier Rolling Stone article. There's this 
14 article that came out just a couple weeks ago. I assume you read it after it came out. 
15 
16 A 
Q Yes. 
And, after you read it, was there anything that you recall standing out as 
17 being inaccurate or you were misquoted in any way? 
18 
19 A 
Q It had a left-leaning slant to it, but was fairly accurate. 
Yeah. I mean, just in terms of the facts of the phones and the 
20 conversations and the issue about keeping the march secret, that kind of thing. 
21 
22 A 
Q No, it was accurate. 
Now, you're aware I think, if you've read that article, that the Kremers and 
23 Katrina Pierson have denied basically everything about these burner phones. 
24 Do you know that? 
25 A Yes, I do.  32 
1 Q And you also I think in this article said that the other person who might be 
2 able to sort of corroborate the story as a witness was Matt Mccleskey, whose name 
3 you've already mentioned, but Mr. Mccleskey is quoted in that Rolling Stone article as 
4 saying that essentially your story is not true. Are you aware of that? 
Yes, I am. 
What do you make of those denials? 5 
6 
7 A 
Q 
A That they, you know, obviously --the way that I read Matt's quote and how 
8 he was quoted in Rolling Stone, I believe that his quote was he did not have --he was not 
9 involved with any conversation with Meadows or Pierson. He didn't completely 
10 acknowledge that he was --deny that he wasn't in a conversation or conversations that 
11 Kylie Kremer was involved in. So he wasn't necessarily confirming he was on the other 
12 end. 
13 What do I make of them denying the absence of the burner phones? Maybe 
14 Matt didn't see it. Maybe Matt --maybe Matt really didn't know any --anything of that. 
15 He was constantly working, conference calls, and had noise-canceling headphones on. 
16 believe they were Dr. Dre headphones that he had on. 
17 Q Now, last week, I saw a story posted online. I think the original outlet was 
18 rawstory.com. And they reported that President Trump's former lawyer, Michael 
19 Cohen, had been in contact with the person who will testify before the select committee 
20 about the purchase of the burner phones. 
21 Are you familiar with this reporting? 
22 
23 A 
Q I'm not familiar with the reporting. 
Okay. Did you speak with Michael Cohen about your testimony before the 
24 select committee? 
25 A Yes, I have.  1 
2 Q 
A Okay. Can you tell us about that? 
Basically, he said: Tell the truth. Tell what your truth is and be honest 
3 and up front with people. 
4 Q Well, so how does that --how is there a connection made there between 
5 you and Michael Cohen for that conversation to even take place? 33 
6 A Jennifer Lawrence had --he's known her for a while. That's how we got in 
7 touch. 
8 Q And did she offer to --did she --was it her idea? Was it Mr. Cohen's idea to 
9 speak? Whose idea was it? 
10 A It was Jennifer's idea to speak with Michael Cohen to see if maybe he knew 
11 an attorney that could come to this meeting with me or see if he thought I needed one at 
12 that point. 
13 
14 
15 Q 
A 
Q Okay. Understood. 
And then we exchanged contact information. 
Okay. All right. That's helpful to know. I understand that it's maybe in 
16 the public record, but you're probably aware --you seem like a fairly well-educated 
17 person --that Mr. Cohen is not himself a lawyer. So I was asking about --or he's no 
18 longer a barred attorney. So I was just trying to clarify on that. 
19 So --but it is true that you did speak with Mr. Cohen about your story and shared 
20 details with him about the purchase of these burner phones. Is that right? 
21 A That is correct. Nothing more than what was in the --he just read the 
22 Rolling Stone article. There was nothing above and beyond that. 
23 Q Okay. And the purpose of this connection that Jennifer made was to see if 
24 you could find legal counsel for purposes of your testimony before the select committee? 
25 A That's correct.  1 
2 Q Now, I want to show you what's marked as exhibit 6. 
I'm sorry,.; it's exhibit 7. We've renumbered them. There we go. 
3 So this is an email from Hunter Walker, March 22nd, at 9:15 in the evening, and 
4 what I'll tell you --the names have been blacked out there, but the people that 34 
5 Mr. Walker is reaching out to are the two media communications contacts for the select 
6 committee. And the subject line there is: Rolling Stone story. 
7 And here it says, you know, you can read it, but I'll read it for purposes of the 
8 record: Hey, guys, hope you are well. I have a story coming for Rolling Stone noting 
9 Scott Johnston will be doing an on-record interview with committee investigators and a 
10 court reporter on Monday afternoon. The story will note Johnston is providing text 
11 messages --including from Amy Kremer and Kylie Kremer --and that investigators have 
12 specifically asked him for corroboration of his claims of their use of burner phones. He 
13 says that in a meeting today, he was warned of consequences for perjury and asked if he 
14 was willing to participate in the interview next week. He was also told other witnesses 
15 who spoke to the committee have denied the use of burner phones. According to 
16 Johnston, his interview last December was an informal interview and only handwritten 
17 notes were taken. He said they now want to go, quote, on record, quote, because of 
18 recent reporting and the, quote, importance, quote, of the issue. He also claims he was 
19 told they may want him to come to D.C. to testify in public hearings. Let me know if you 
20 guys want to respond in any way, including OTR and on background. Thanks. 
21 So, Mr. Johnston, based on the timeline, you and I spoke on the phone earlier in 
22 the afternoon on the same day that Hunter Walker wrote this email. It appears that 
23 sometime after you and I spoke on the phone, you may have reached out to Mr. Walker 
24 to talk to him specifically about the conversation that you and I had just had, as is your 
25 right.  1 There's nothing --I want to be clear. I'm not trying to suggest that there's any 
2 requirement on your part to keep any of these conversations confidential. There is no 
3 requirement. 
4 I am curious, however, what your motivation is for speaking with Hunter Walker 
5 so quickly after you and I had spoken about this issue. 
6 A He had mentioned that he'd be curious if there was any followup from the 
7 committee. So that's the reason that I spoke out to him at that point. So the public 
8 hearing was something that he definitely had it in there, because I don't recall you or I 
9 speaking about public hearings. 
10 Q Yeah. I was going to ask about that. You and I --to the best of my 
11 recollection, we never suggested anything about public hearings one way or another to 
12 you, so you didn't tell him that, at least, I think. 
13 A I did not. 
14 Q Okay. Now, Mr. Johnston, I think you're aware, because we've had 
15 conversations about your own phone records a few months back, that the select 
16 committee has obtained phone records from service providers. 
17 Is that fair to say, you know that? 
18 
19 A 
Q Yes. 
Now, I can tell you that we have been able to review Kylie Kremer's call 35 
20 records for a time period much larger than the one that we've been talking about today, 
21 from November 1, 2020, through January 31, 2021. And the records include essentially 
22 what you think of as metadata, so the phone numbers, to or from, the time of day, the 
23 length of it, that kind of thing. 
24 And, earlier in our conversation, you talked about how on December 29 --that 
25 was the timeframe that you gave --you understood Kylie to have been having a phone  36 
1 call on her personal cell phone with someone she represented to be from the White 
2 House and Katrina Pierson. 
3 There are no records of any calls between Ms. Kremer's phone and a phone 
4 number associated with either Mark Meadows or the White House during that entire 
5 3-month span, much less the narrower December 28th-29th-30th timeframe. 
6 So I guess what I want to make sure I'm totally clear on is whether you still --that 
7 your recollection is truly that someone from the White House was calling Kylie Kremer on 
8 December 29th? 
9 A That's what Kylie gave information for me to believe. I had no reason not 
10 to trust her at that point. Can I confirm that with official records? No, but that's what 
11 I was told. 
12 Q 
13 store 1520. 
14 
15 A 
Q Okay. Now, we also went and checked with CVS for the records at the 
Okay. 
And even though it was a cash purchase, they're able to track all of those 
16 transactions, even those made with cash. What CVS told us is there is no record of any 
17 transaction for a prepaid phone, whether with cash or credit card, no transactions at all at 
18 CVS 1520 for the purchase of prepaid phones on December 28, 2020. 
19 There are no purchases of any prepaid phones of any kind the next day, December 
20 29th, at that store across the street from the DoubleTree Hotel. 
21 December 27th, there was a single transaction involving prepaid phones, but the 
22 details of that transaction don't match any of the details that you've provided to us 
23 earlier, to Rolling Stone, or to us today. It's not the right number of phones, not the 
24 right price, and it was not at a time period when you were in Palm Springs, and, in fact, it 
25 was during a time period that you were in the area of Pasadena.  37 
1 They also were able to check your CVS Extra Care information using the phone 
2 number ending in- And according to CVS' records, that Extra Care account has only 
3 been used in the State of California once, and it was in Los Angeles in February of 2019, 
4 never in Palm Springs, no transactions in California in December of 2020. 
5 So, to the best of your knowledge, is there any reason why, according to CVS' 
6 records, the purchase that you've told us about never happened? 
7 
8 A 
Q I would have no information why, no. 
So we just want to be fair to you in the course of all of this process, having 
9 spoken to us before, having spoken to Rolling Stone multiple times, this is the last chance 
10 on the record to have a say about what this story is and what the truth really is. 
11 So, based on all of the information that we've talked about today and the 
12 evidence that we have represented to you from CVS, is the story that you've told to 
13 Rolling Stone and to us today true? 
14 
15 A Yes. 
Mr.- All right. Let me pause here and see if any of my colleagues have 
16 any followup questions. A few more have joined us during the course of the interview. 
17 I don't see any. 
18 So I think, with that, Mr. Johnston, we appreciate your time very much today. 
19 And, if we have anything further, we'll be in touch, but we can go off the record. 
20 [Whereupon, at 5:06 p.m. the interview was concluded.]  1
