Here's the Tribe article. 
Still reviewing the opp brief in my Georgia case in prep for tomorrow mornings expedited hearing. I'll send 
more when I have a chance.

John, External Message 
Could you send me any written materials on electoral vote counting issues that you would like us to digest? 
Feel free to send the Tribe article that you mentioned as well; he has several on the subject that I have read, and I want 
to make sure we're both thinking of the same one. 
Many thanks, 
Greg
