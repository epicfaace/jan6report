Hi Kristin-I have some time tomorrow morning 
You -Jan 14, 2021 at 1 :37 PM -iMessage 
Hi Chris. Are we able to have a call? I'm doing a number of pitches for Cordie and 
just need to know our latest direction 
Jan 12, 2021 
Dr Cordi -Jan 12, 2021 at 7:13 PM -iMessage 
Chris do you have any pockets of time to reschedule the call with Kristin? Karyn 
was cancelling for herself and not Kristin. 
You -Jan 12, 2021 at 11:44 AM -iMessage

No. Jan 18th is when their board meets and they will get back to 
Dr Cordi -Jan 2, 2021 at 4: 53 PM -iMessage 
Thanks Kristin you're awesome. Just curious, any word from the Republican 
organization up North yet? 
You -Jan 2, 2021 at 4:52 PM -iMessage 
I'm submitting them to the White House planner 
Dr Cordi -Jan 2, 2021 at 4:52 PM -iMessage 
Kremers haha 
Dr Cordi -Jan 2, 2021 at 4:52 PM -iMessage 
Awesome. So we have passes? Are the passes approved through the White House 
or the creamers? 
You -Jan 2, 2021 at 4:50 PM -iMessage 
I have no idea. I believe Pastor Mark Burns goes on at 9:30. That's what time I'm 
getting there 
Dr Cordi -Jan 2, 2021 at 4:45 PM -iMessage 
Does it really start at 7 AM? 
You -Jan 2, 2021 at 4:41 PM -iMessage 
Yes. This is the White House event-or so I'm told. This is where our passes 
are for.  Dr Cordi -Jan 2, 2021 at 4:35 PM -iMessage 
Any intel here? 
Dr Cordi -Jan 1, 2021 at 3:23 PM -iMessage 
Wow this thing is really moving

Sounds great. Thanks Kristin. Who's event is that? Just curious for Chris's 
sake haha 
You -Jan 1, 2021 at 11:10 AM -iMessage 
Probably sometime between 230 and 4:30 PM. Can you please let me know if this 
works for you. 
You -Jan 1, 2021 at 11:09 AM -iMessage 
The Rally is in area 7 of freedom Plaza I believe. I think this will be the only stage 
and speaking opportunity on that day 
You -Jan 1, 2021 at 11:os AM -iMessage 
I'll confirm a time later. But will make it late enough for you to attend the White 
House event and then speak 
You -Jan 1, 2021 at 11:os AM -iMessage 
I have networked and traded favors to get Dr Cordi a speaking spot on the health 
freedom stage on Jan six in the afternoon 
You -Jan 1, 2021 at 11:07 AM -iMessage 
Happy new year my friends!

Thanks so much Kristin for all ur work Dec 31, 2020  Exhibit 4 -Page 5

Thinking positively! 
You -Dec 31, 2020 at 7:37 PM -iMessage 
I am fairly certain I can accommodate everyone! As long as no one stabs me in 
the back before then. At this rate you never know lol!! Happy new year guys 
Chris Lippe -Dec 31, 2020 at 7:36 PM -iMessage 
Have a Happy New Year!! 
Chris Lippe -Dec 31, 2020 at 7:35 PM -iMessage 
Thank you Kristin-if the VIP list if fairly open, I will have my son, Jake Lippe, and 
my fiance w me. Jen Franco. If that's not possible then just Cordie and I. We'll see 
you next week 
You -Dec 31, 2020 at 7:17 PM -iMessage 
Caroline is mostly who she says she is 
You -Dec 31, 2020 at 7:17 PM -iMessage 
I confirmed today that the event is officially taken over from the White House. 
One of my good friends is a DC lobbyist who had dinner with a senior White 
House staffer. There will probably not be anyone else on the stage other than 
POTUS on the sixth. This has not been announced but this is what was told to my 
friend 
You -Dec 31, 2020 at 7:16 PM -iMessage 
OK. I'm going to put you guys on the VIP list for the event on the six 
Chris Lippe -Dec 31, 2020 at 7:13 PM -iMessage 
On Tuesday? No. We arrive that night. We notified Pastor Gibson 
You -Dec 31, 2020 at 7:10 PM -iMessage 
Happy New Year's guys. I'm just confirming you are in Pastor Gibson's group 
to speak?? 
You -Dec 31, 2020 at 10:36 AM -iMessage 
I think the bottom line is the Kramer's are telling people things to get money out 
of them and their intent is not to do the right thing 
Chris Lippe -Dec 31, 2020 at 10:32 AM -iMessage 
Smart move Kristin to stay away. The game of Rallyers- ugh 
You -Dec 31, 2020 at 10:19 AM -iMessage 
I'm aware of the pastors think that they're putting a permit in their name. I'm also 
not sure this is not a scam. I declined to put it in my name  Exhibit 4 -Page 6 
You -Dec 31, 2020 at 9:34 AM -iMessage 
This is what I have to report at this time. I am going to distance myself because 
this has been all consuming and taking away from everything else. At this point 
there is no event on the fifth and the sixth I am unable to confirm any speakers 
including Roger 
You -Dec 31, 2020 at 9:33 AM -iMessage 
She has done this to Alex Jones for the Jan 6 event. He thinks the event is his 
because he has spent 300 K. But the permits are in the Kremer's name. From 
Kylie Kramer's mouth he is not setting foot on that stage. The whole thing is a 
duplicitous scheme 
You -Dec 31, 2020 at 9:32 AM -iMessage 
The whole thing is a scam in my opinion. Kylie is only trying to add us as names 
on the permit. Which still means she controls it. That way we find the funding for 
the event but it would still be her event. 
You -Dec 31, 2020 at 9:31 AM -iMessage 
Kylie tried to then deceive Pastor Gibson and Pastor Locke offering all three of us 
the permit telling them she had the funding. She doesn't. 
You -Dec 31, 2020 at 9:31 AM -iMessage 
Yesterday went from bad to worse. Kylie Kramer called me and offered me the 
permit for the event. There were a number of misrepresentations given to me 
including that she had the funding which she does not. Alex Jones funded it but 
that money went to Cindy. I tried to bridge the peace but neither side will work 
together. Cindy will not give up the money unless it's her event and Kylie won't 
give up the permit

Chris Lippe -Dec 30, 2020 at 7:17 PM -iMessage 
I am sending a contact- you did not get it from me or anyone at the White House. 
Find a way to explain why your asking-Maybe say you've been planning an event 
on the 6th but have heard there may be one large event-is that true .... 
You -Dec 30, 2020 at 6:09 PM -iMessage 
Alex is paying for the stage and given Cindy money for the groundwork. This 
came from the owner of Publix supermarket  Exhibit 4 -Page 7 
You -Dec 30, 2020 at 6:09 PM -iMessage 
Yes. It's just hard to discern who's telling the truth. I think Ali has blocked all of 
the other speakers to make this about him. 
Chris Lippe -Dec 30, 2020 at 6:09 PM -iMessage 
Smart move Roger 
You -Dec 30, 2020 at 6:08 PM -iMessage 
Ali is under the delusion that Alex Jones him and Roger are the main speakers for 
Saturday and the only other person that speaking is the president. Roger 
question that but that's the story he's sticking to 
You -Dec 30, 2020 at 6:07 PM -iMessage 
Trick lol 
You -Dec 30, 2020 at 6:07 PM -iMessage 
Roger asked Ali to Have Caroline tell Kimberly Guilfoyle to text him to vouch 
for her 
Chris Lippe -Dec 30, 2020 at 6:07 PM -iMessage 
Trick 
Dr Cordi -Dec 30, 2020 at 6:07 PM -iMessage 
Dirty truck? 
You -Dec 30, 2020 at 6:06 PM -iMessage 
I honestly think The creamers and Ali have pulled some ginormous dirty truck 
right now. To keep people out. I just had a conference call with Roger I and Ali 
were Roger tried to force the truth out of him and I still don't think I have a grasp 
on the situation 
Chris Lippe -Dec 30, 2020 at 6:06 PM -iMessage 
Hopefully Maggie will reply 
You -Dec 30, 2020 at 6:05 PM -iMessage 
The rest of the time when they speak it's about what's going on. Not some thing 
like a rally. Roger doesn't want to use his limited time on petty nonsense. He is 
advocating for a pardon for our friend who's in prison and for him that's more 
important 
You -Dec 30, 2020 at 6:05 PM -iMessage 
I wish it was that easy. They talked about the rally In passing once and the 
president mentioned he was thinking of speaking 
Chris Lippe -Dec 30, 2020 at 6:02 PM -iMessage 
Rogers access to the President is best resource to sort the bullshit  Exhibit 4 -Page 8 
You -Dec 30, 2020 at 6:01 PM -iMessage 
I have been told that permits for all events are in the Kremer's name. Kylie Kremer 
went around and called Julio and Karyn. They did not pick up but they gave me 
her phone number. I'm still trying to figure out what is going on 
You -Dec 30, 2020 at 6:00 PM -iMessage 
I'm still trying to get to the bottom of things. I think Ali has tried to manipulate 
this entire event. I don't even believe this woman is from the White House. 
Chris Lippe -Dec 30, 2020 at 5:38 PM -iMessage 
All texts are out. Tony from the CA GOP replied we have no interaction w Trump at 
this point, so no help here. 
Dec 27, 2020 
You -Dec 27, 2020 at 3:05 PM -iMessage 
We can just do our Tuesday call. I am scheduled to land at that time so it would 
be tight to have a call 
Chris Lippe -Dec 27, 2020 at 2: 55 PM -iMessage 
My only open appointment time Monday is 430p-5 PST. We also have our 1pm on 
Tuesday set. 
You -Dec 27, 2020 at 1 :32 PM -iMessage 
I am only free at 12 or 1230 your time. Flying home tomorrow. Have to take a 
connection so it's an all day event. That's my connection. Let me know if it works 
Dr Cordi -Dec 27, 2020 at 1 :30 PM -iMessage 
Also let's get table next to stage

There's one other person involved Felisa. I don't know her. But she reached out to

You -Dec 23, 2020 at 6:22 PM -iMessage 
Well I'm on your coast. So anytime after 8 AM Pacific works for me 
Dr Cordi -Dec 23, 2020 at 6:19 PM -iMessage 
Yeah for sure. In between patients now. Let's u, Chris and I jump on a call and 
hash it out since he may know some details we don't. Tomorrow or Saturday 
works for me. 
You -Dec 23, 2020 at 6:17 PM -iMessage 
But I would like to talk merchandising with you. I'd like to put some of Roger's 
shirts on your table. 
You -Dec 23, 2020 at 6:17 PM -iMessage 
OK. Well I'm going to have a conference call with her myself. I don't put people 
meaning Roger places without making sure he's protected
