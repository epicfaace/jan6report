Subject: Only two options 
Verified, audited results from properly counted, legal and timely ballots -Trump 
Wins 
Pelosi/ Schumer raw partisan political power rule -GOP legislatures elect to not 
send in electors from an unreliable and rigged system before all questionable 
conduct has been answered which means Biden does not receive 270 electoral 
votes, and consequently, the House voting by state delegations (26) elect the 
President -Trump wins. 
The only way Trump loses is rigged system (like the insurance policy of Russia 
collusion) and Republicans do not have the will to push back for the truth. This is 
coup 3.0 -Russian Collusion; Impeachment; and now Rigged Election.
