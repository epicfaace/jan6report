Nunes, and Cruz won't be able to 
attend so that opens a gap. 
Ken Paxton is attending if you think 
we should backfill. Or not.

Don't pin her 
Maggie won't help her

How/why is she not letting them I'm? • Have our security escort her out

She's taking over the event 
If I'm in charge of this event how can I 
get her out? She's making the 
decisions. 
Do we have our own Security? If so, 
get who's name on the permit to have 
security escort her out 
I have the permit. 
And ok 
If your name is on it, you can have 
security give her the boot
