2 Mr- Let's go on the record at 10:36. 
Good morning. Today is April 29th, 2022, and we're here for the transcribed 
3 interview of Mr. Frank Marchisella conducted by the House Select Committee to 
4 Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol pursuant to House 
5 Resolution 503. 
6 My name i I'm an investigative counsel with the select committee. 
7 And at this time I'd ask the witness to please state your full name and spell your 
8 last name for the record. 
9 Mr. Marchisella. Frank Anthony Marchisella, M-a-r-c-h-i-s-e-1-1-a. 
10 Mr.- And then, this is a staff-led interview. Members do have the link 3 
11 for the Webex and have the option of joining today. I don't foresee that happening, but 
12 if a member of the committee comes into the Webex, I'll alert you to that and let you 
13 know that we've got additional people on the call. 
14 
15 Mr. Marchisella. Okay. 
Mr. - There are no other staff members on the call. But same thing, I'll 
16 let you know if another staff member, like another lawyer from the committee, like me, 
17 joins us. 
18 And then I'll ask --so ask counsel to state their names for the record. 
19 Mr. Merting. Robert Merting. 
20 Ms. Crick. And Cindy Crick with Cindy Crick Law, C-r-i-c-k. 
21 Mr Great. And then, Frank, just a few housekeeping matters before 
22 we get started. I know last time we talked, it was a little more informal. Today, we've 
23 got some official reporters that'll be transcribing everything that we say. 
24 
25 Mr. Marchisella. Uh-huh. 
Mr. - So to make their job a little bit easier, let's just try to make sure to let  1 me finish my question before you start your answer so that we're not talking over each 
2 other. It's pretty hard for them to record two people talking at the same time. 
3 
4 
5 
6 Mr. Marchisella. Okay. 
Mr. Does that make sense? 
Mr. Marchisella. Yes, sir 
Mr. - Okay. And then, also, sort of on the same theme, they can only 4 
7 record verbal answers. So make sure that we're not using like a head nod or a uh-huh or 
8 an uh-uh. Just a yes or a no or a complete sentence. 
9 And then, today, just asking you to provide complete answers to the best of your 
10 recollection. Knowing that we've spoken previously, we're really just trying to get to the 
11 truth here, the best answer that you've got today. I'm not concerned about, you know, 
12 if last time you told us the car was red and today you said it was maroon. Not a big deal. 
13 Don't get hung up on these kind of fine details. 
14 And just, if your memory is fuzzy, just let me know, and we can deal with that 
15 when we get to it and, if you don't recall the answer to a question, just say "I don't recall." 
16 
17 Mr. Marchisella. Yes, sir. 
Mr. - All right. Great. And then, I'm also always happy to rephrase a 
18 question or provide some sort of clarification if you don't understand what I'm asking 
19 you. 
20 
21 Mr. Marchisella. Okay. 
Mr. - And then, also, I'll try to take a break about every hour. I'm hoping 
22 that we'll go about 2 hours today. And if you need a break at a different time, just let 
23 me know, or if you need a break to talk to your counsel, I'm happy to do that as well. 
24 
25 Mr. Marchisella. Okay. Thank you. 
Mr. - Yep. And then, also, just another warning --and this is a reminder  1 that we provide all witnesses that we talk to, but that it is unlawful to provide a false 
2 statement to a congressional investigator like myself. And so for the purposes of this 
3 interview, providing false information could result in criminal penalties for false 
4 statements. 
5 Do you understand that, or have you had a discussion with your lawyers about 
6 that? 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 Mr. Marchisella. Yes, sir. 
Mr.- Okay. 
Q EXAMINATION 
BYMR.-
AII right. Then, with that, I think we'll start just with a little bit about your 
12 background. Could you first actually just tell me your age? 
13 A Fifty-nine. 
14 Q And then what --what do you do careerwise? 
15 A I'm a construction worker. 5 
16 Q Okay. Great. And then, am I right --or why don't you tell me, any military 
17 or law enforcement background? 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q None whatsoever. 
Okay. But you have a --you've worked as a bouncer, I believe, right? 
Yes. Security. 
Okay. Security. Gotcha. 
Yes, sir. 
Okay. And then, why don't you just start with telling me how you came to 
24 find out about the Oath Keepers and then came to join the organization. 
25 A I believe it was --if I'm not mistaken, I believe it was on the news, and just  1 went to their website and joined. 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 Q Okay. And around when was that? 
A November of --it was the year the --
Mr. Merting. 2020. 
Mr. Marchisella. Was it 2020? 
Q 
A BYMR.-
2020 of the Presidential election? 
Yeah. Yes, sir. 
Q Okay. November. And was your interest in the Oath Keepers related to 
10 the Presidential election? 
11 
12 
13 
14 A None whatsoever. 
Q Okay. What sort of got you interested in the Oath Keepers? 
A Just the protection of people and property. 
Q Okay. And had you been seeing things around that time that gave you 
15 concerns about that? 
16 A Yes, sir. Yes, sir. On the news, you know, same thing everybody else was 
17 seeing: places burning; houses burning; cars burning, destroyed; people getting beat, 
18 stuff like that. 
19 Q And so those are kind of related to the --some of the protests, a lot of the 
20 racial justice protests that were happening over the summer of 2020? 6 
21 A Yes. Yes. All the protests. Not --1 wasn't really looking at the racial part 
22 of it. 
23 Q Okay. Got it. 
24 And then --so you said you found the Oath Keepers online. How did you --or 
25 sorry. And was it a news report?  1 
2 
3 A Yeah, I think it was a news report. 
Q Okay. And where was that news report? 
A I can't remember where they were. I think --I think the news was Virginia. 
4 I'm not sure. 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 Q Okay. Was it like an --it was like an online news source? 
A No, it was --I think it was TV. 
Q TV news? Okay. 
A Yeah. I believe so. 
Q And do you recall what was being reported about them? Was it their 
10 activity at a rally or something? 
11 
12 
13 
14 A Yes, sir. 
Q Okay. 
A That's exactly what it was. 
Q Great. And then --so you find the Oath Keepers website, and what 
15 happens after that? 
16 A I researched a little bit and found out it was military and law enforcement, 
17 ex and present. Felt like it was a good group at the time. 
Q Okay. 
A At the time. 
Q And so how did you go about actually joining? 7 
18 
19 
20 
21 A I typed it in and up come a website. It was like, you know, joining anything 
22 really. It was pretty basic and simple. 
23 
24 
25 Q Was it like an on line web form, or how did you --
A Yeah. 
Q How did you contact somebody?  1 A Well, yes. It was a form, I believe, and you filled it out. And then I got an 
2 email back --I believe it was an email --yeah --stating that they wanted my driver's 
3 license and my CWP for, I guess, vetting. 
4 
5 
6 Q 
A 
Q And CWP, is that conceal --a concealed carry permit? 
Yes. Yes, sir. 
And do you know what was done to vet you, or did anybody explain that 
7 process to you? 
8 
9 
10 A 
Q 
A No, sir, none whatsoever. 
Okay. So after you were vetted, what happened at that point? 
Basically nothing. I paid the tuition, and then it wasn't long after that --it 
11 was like --I'm not even saying a week. And then we got an email saying, call to action 
12 for Atlanta. 
13 Q And let me just ask you quickly. You mentioned that you paid the dues or 
14 the tuition that they asked for. How much were your dues? 
15 
16 
17 
18 A 
Q 
A 
Q If I'm not mistaken, I think it was $1,200. 
And were you told at all what those dues would go towards? 
No. 
Having been a member for, you know, a brief period of time, did you learn 
19 about what your dues were going towards? 
20 
21 
22 
23 no --
24 
25 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A No, sir. 
Okay. 
I never got no articles of anything until after all this was over. There was 
After --
--proof at all that I was even a member till they sent me the articles. 8  1

9 
10 
11 
12 Q When did you --when did you end up receiving that? 
A I think it was March. 
Q And when you --
A I could pull --I mean, I'm talking about not too long ago. 
Q Oh, of this --of 2020 --2022 I mean? 
A 2021, but to the end of it. 
Q Got it. Okay. 
A Yes, sir. 
Q All right. So months after January 6th? 
A March. Yes, sir. 
Q And when you said --when you say articles, what do you mean? 
A Oh, I --this is going to sound hard to believe, but I never opened it. It just 
13 said Oath Keepers, a package. I --when I say open, I opened it, glanced in there. It 
14 was papers, and that was it. 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 Q Okay. Got it. So just some sort of paperwork --
A Yeah. 
Q --after your joining? 
A Yes, sir. No more interest in it whatsoever after that. 
Q Okay. Do you by any chance still have that package? 
A I may. I could look to see, but I don't --I don't know. I don't --
Q Okay. 
A --know if I got it or throwed it away with the mail or what, no. 
Q Yeah. 
Mr~ Cindy and Robert, if maybe we can follow up afterwards. If he 
25 happens to still have that welcome package, we'd --9  Ms. Crick. Yep. 
Mr.- We'd like to -­

Mr --to see that. 
BYMR-10

4 
5 
6 Q Okay. And then were you put in contact? How did you --I know you said 
7 you received the call to action for the November 18th Atlanta rally. 
8 
9 
10 
11 A Yes, sir. 
Q How did you receive that call to action? 
A Email. 
Q Email. Okay. And so were you put on like an email listserv, or what 
12 happened? 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 A I guess it was with the membership when I put everything in. 
Q Okay. 
A And then --pardon me? 
Q Did you use ProtonMail with the Oath Keepers? 
A I don't know what ProtonMail is, sir. 
Q Okay. So it was just your personal email address --
A Yes, sir. 
Q --that they had? 
All right. And then --so that, I take it, was joining with the national Oath 
22 Keepers. But am I right that there's also the South Carolina chapter? 
23 A No, sir. There was no different chapters at --there --that had nothing to 
24 do --it was all one, as far as I was concerned. It's just the guys in the area met on the 
25 Mondays. But it wasn't a chapter. I don't even know why they were calling it a  1 chapter, because it was a very brief time. 
2 Q What --let's go in just a little bit to how you met the other South Carolina 
3 local guys and how --how you --to the extent you formed a group, how you started 
4 coming together. 
5 A Off the Oath Keeper chat room. It was an open chat room. And, 
6 basically, you get on there, and who's from South Carolina, stuff like that. 
7 
8 
9 Q And which application was that chat room on? 
A I have no idea, sir. 
Q Okay. 
A It was on --it was on the website. It was on the Oath Keeper website. 11 
10 
11 Q Okay. So that was like an on line portal, not --not the Signal chats that we'll 
12 talk about --
13 
14 
15 
16 A No, sir. 
Q --in a little bit? 
A No. 
Q And then, about how many of the local group that you were meeting with, 
17 about how many people was that? 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 A Three to four, five people. 
Q And when was that first meeting? 
A 
Q It was Monday. I don't know the exact date. It was Mondays at 8 o'clock. 
Mondays at 8 o'clock. 
Did the first meeting happen after the trip to Atlanta? 
A Yes, sir. 
Q Okay. Sometime around Christmas or earlier than Christmas? 
A I believe it was earlier than Christmas.  12 
1 Q Okay. All right. We'll come back to that a little bit then. So we can first 
2 go to the November 18th rally in Atlanta. 
3 
4 A Uh-huh. 
Q So tell me a little bit about that call to action. Who did it come from and 
5 what did it say? 
6 
7 
8 
9 A I had no idea where it come from. 
Mr. Marchisella. I did send you the thing, didn't I, the call to action? 
Mr. Merting. Yes. That's --
Mr. Marchisella. Yes. It was email. It give a place where it was going to be 
10 held. And then we drove there and basically parked in a parking lot, and then 
11 met --there was another Oath Keeper there in the parking lot. Don't know his name. 
12 And we told him --we walked up to him and said, We're new Oath Keepers. Where do 
13 we need to go? 
14 And they said, Go to the steps of the capitol. They said, Stewart will be there. 
15 And so we made our way there, and that's where I met Stewart on the steps of the 
16 capitol in Atlanta. 
17 
18 
19 
20 Q And how many --you said we drove down. Who did you drive down with? 
A Oh, it was me and Dave Kirk, and my wife drove with us. 
Q Okay. Can you tell me about Dave Kirk? Who is he? 
A Yeah. That's a friend of mine I've known for several years. He used to be 
21 my tae kwon do instructor years ago, and just became friends and worked --we worked 
22 together on some things. Just friends. But he --he's military and he was a police 
23 officer. 
24 Q What was his history, to the extent you knew it --know it, with the Oath 
25 Keepers? How did he know of the Oath Keepers?  1 A Well, I don't --he said he was a member prior when he lived in Oregon. 
2 That's what he told me. I mean, that's all I know. 
3 
4 
5 
6 Q So he had --so he had joined the Oath Keepers a while back --
A Yeah. 
Q --and then --
A But I mean --I never knew it. When I told him that I had joined, he said, 
7 Oh, I remember them. 
8 Q And so he sort of became active again in the Oath Keepers once you had 
9 joined? 
A Yeah. Basically, yes. 13 
10 
11 Q And did you tell him about that call to action and that you were going to be 
12 going to Atlanta? 
13 
14 A Yes. 
Q And he just decided that sounded fun or something, like, he wanted to get 
15 involved in and came with you? 
16 
17 A That's correct. 
Q Okay. All right. And then, so you travel to Atlanta on the 18th, the three 
18 of you --you, your wife, and Mr. Kirk. And do you recall who the other Oath Keeper that 
19 you met in that parking lot or parking garage was? 
20 
21 
22 A Yes. It was Whip. Whip? Is it Whip? 
Q Whip? Yeah. Have you heard --
A And Kellye, the attorney for Rob --Stewart. And there was other Oath 
23 Keepers there, but I didn't --I don't remember --know their names. 
24 
25 Q About how many other Oath Keepers were there for that event? 
A Maybe 10. Between 9 and 11, put it that way, to be safe.  1 Q And then, were there --of that kind of 9 to 11 Oath Keepers, anybody else 
2 that you later ran into at other events, like either January 6th or any other Oath Keeper 
3 events that you remember? 
4 
5 
6 
7 A 
Q 
A 
Q Now, how was that question, sir? 
Of that group that was in Atlanta -­
Uh-huh. 
--did you later see any of them at other Oath Keeper events, like are they 
8 people that you ran into again? 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A I only seen them one other time, and that was in D.C. 
In D.C.? Okay. 
Yes, sir. 
And it was all of that group? 
That's --no. There was one more. There was a gentleman --he was a 
14 Cuban gentleman. I can't remember his name. He was an Oath Keeper from Florida, 
15 but I can't remember his name. But he was --I know that he had an online marketing 
16 company, like an e-commerce company. And I'm trying to remember his name, and I 
17 don't remember. It starts with a D. Dom, Darin, or --not Darin. 
18 
19 
20 
21 Anyway, he --I did see him in Atlanta and I did see him in D.C. 
Q 
A 
Q Okay. 
I seen Whip, Kellye, and --and Stewart. 
Were --this gentleman that you were describing from Florida, were the 
22 other Oath Keepers that were there also from Florida or from all over? 
23 A No. Did not know where none of them were from. I think there was a 14 
24 couple there --I am pretty sure that a couple of them there were from Georgia, because 
25 they seemed to know the streets and what --you know, where everything was.  15 
1 Q Okay. So when you arrived, Kellye and Whip told you to head towards the 
2 steps of the capitol? 
3 
4 
5 A No, sir. No, sir. 
Q Okay. What --
A Kellye and Whip and Stewart were already there. There was another Oath 
6 Keeper --don't know his name --that was in the parking lot. 
7 
8 Q Okay. 
A Yeah. And when I --I approached him, because he had Oath Keeper patch, 
9 and I asked him --I says, where --I'm new. You know, where --you know, where do we 
10 need to go? 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 He said, Stewart's on the steps of the capitol. You can approach there. 
And then we walked over to --that's when we met Stewart, Whip, and Kellye --
Q And --
A --and other Oath Keepers, but I don't know their names. 
Q And so that was the first time you had met Mr. Rhodes, right? 
A That is correct. 
Q Okay. And how did that meeting go? What did he say to you? 
A Asked my name, asked me --he said, What's your background? 
I said, Security, bouncer. 
And he said, Okay. He said, Where are you from? 
And I said, Lewis, South Carolina. 
He said, All right. Stand here for a while. 
So we stood there, me and Dave. And then he left about maybe, I don't know, 
24 maybe 20 minutes, came back and said, All right. I want you and Dave to go down on 
25 the corner --down at the --there was a corner down from the capitol. He said, Just  16 
1 stand there and watch, see if there's any activity or anything like that. 
2 And we did. And that's where the Georgia State Police was and the Atlanta 
3 Police. They were all right there where we were standing. And, basically, 
4 that's --that's the last time I seen Stewart till that afternoon, the evening. 
5 Q And --
6 A And he came back when they were speaking --where the speakers were 
7 speaking. I wasn't there. 
8 
9 
10 
11 Q Gotcha. So for most of that day, you just kind of manned that corner and --
A Yeah. 
Q --were lookout? 
A Yeah. Well, I don't know about lookout. Just see if anybody --but I don't 
12 know why I was there, because law enforcement was strong right there. 
13 Q Right. Okay. I want to ask you a little bit about other groups that you 
14 observed that day. 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 A Uh-huh. 
Q Do you know who the Proud Boys are? 
A Yes, I know who the Proud Boys are. 
Q Okay. And did you see any groups of Proud Boys there that day? 
A Couldn't identify them. The only ones I could identify were ones called 
20 76ers or 19 --or 1776ers, because I --the only reason why, because they had the patch. 
21 First time I ever seen them in my life. 
22 And there was another one. The 76ers, and there was --oh, there was another 
23 one. I can't remember the name of them. Couldn't tell if they were Proud Boys, 
24 because they didn't have no patches or emblems on. Oh, 1776, and there was another 
25 one. I can't remember. They actually had a flag that they were holding, but I can't  1 remember. The 1 percent or 2 percent or something like that. 
2 Q Three Percenters? 
3 
4 
5 
6 A Yes. The Three Percenters, I believe, yes, sir. 
Q Gotcha. 
A Yes, sir. They were there, because I remember their insignia. 
Q Okay. For the Proud Boys, normally they wear black and yellow are the 
7 colors that they wear. And a lot of times they'll march kind of in a group. Do you 
8 remember seeing a group wearing prominently yellow or black? 
A No, sir. 
Q Okay. 
A If I did, I didn't --I didn't register to me. 17 
9 
10 
11 
12 Q Okay. All right. So after you spent some time on that corner just kind of 
13 watching what was going on, what did you guys do for the rest of the day? 
14 A Well, I know --I can't --I don't know if it was the Atlanta State Police or the 
15 Atlanta Police. They came up to us --me and Dave was standing there, and they asked if 
16 we could help --the speakers were over, they asked if we could help clear the streets. 
17 And then that's when we, you know, helped, just asked people to move along and wrap 
18 that day up. 
19 
20 Q And do you recall about what time that might have been? 
A Oh, it was still sunny, so I'm going to guess. I have no idea, but I'm going to 
21 guess at this and say between 5:00, maybe 6 o'clock. 
22 Q All right. And did you arrive early in the morning, or when did you get to 
23 Atlanta? 
24 A It was probably --it was about lunchtime. Total time at Atlanta capitol, 
25 maybe --maybe 4 hours.  18 
Did you see any of the speakers that day? 1 
2 Q 
A No, sir. I was at the corner. Everybody else --when I got there, there was 
3 a lady speaking, but I have no idea her name or even listened to what she was saying. 
4 
5 
6 Q On that day, there was sort of an event where some of the speakers, 
including --well, actually, let me first ask you: Do you know who Ali Alexander is? 
A I met him, but not at the time, sir. Not at that time. I did not know --you 
7 couldn't even know his name or what he looked like. If you want --you want a time line, 
8 right, sir? 
9 
10 
11 Q 
A 
Q Yeah. So let's --
At that time, I had no idea who this was. 
Okay. So at that time, you didn't know. When did you meet 
12 Mr. Alexander? 
13 A After --after --when everybody went to the hotel room, that's where I met 
14 Mr. Alexander. 
15 
16 
17 Q 
A 
Q Okay. So we'll come to that in one second. 
Yes, sir. 
But what I was going to ask --oh, and then, also, are you familiar with 
18 Mr. Alex Jones? 
19 
20 
21 
22 A 
Q 
A 
Q No, sir. 
Okay. Do you know who that is? 
No. 
Okay. Well, what I was going to ask you was, there was a group of 
23 individuals who were speakers at the event. Ali Alexander is one of those people. 
24 Alex Jones --I recognize you don't know who he is --is another. But a group of them 
25 entered the capitol on that day.  19 
1 Do you ever remember hearing people talking about some of the rally organizers 
2 or leaders entering the capitol? 
3 
4 
5 
6 A 
Q 
A In Atlanta? 
In Atlanta, uh-huh. 
No, sir. Was not aware of that whatsoever. 
Q Okay. And this wasn't like the January 6th event. This wasn't, you know, 
7 a forced entry or anything. It was --it was just some of the speakers going into the 
8 capitol, but it sounds like --
9 
10 
11 A No. 
Q --you don't remember that? 
A When I got there, sir, the capitol was barricaded, and there was police 
12 officers behind the barricade. The steps leading to the capitol is where we were at --for 
13 20, 30 minutes before we got moved down to the corner. 
14 Q Could you describe just sort of the mood of that day? Was it jubilant? 
15 Were people getting angry? 
16 
17 
18 
19 A I seen no anger. I seen no violence. No, sir. Did not. 
Q Okay. So not like --you know, nothing like the January 6th events? 
A Nothing, no. No, sir. 
Q Okay. And then sorry to repeat this question, I think, but you said you did 
20 not hear the speeches? 
21 
22 
23 A No, sir. 
Q All right. 
A Heard that. When you say heard, yes. I heard loud --there was 
24 microphones, but I couldn't make out what --nothing what they were saying, and I really 
25 wasn't listening.  20 
1 Q Right. Okay. Then, so after you helped clear some of the --one of the 
2 street ways after the speeches, tell me what happened after that. 
3 A Okay. Everybody met back in that same parking lot from where we first 
4 started. And then that's where Stewart --that's where we all stood there and we got 
5 the first Signal. I didn't even know what Signal was, and got the Signal on our phones. 
6 
7 
8 
9 Q So when you were all present together, did Mr. Rhodes tell you to download 
Signal? 
A Yes, sir. 
Q Okay. And what was the purpose of downloading Signal at that time? 
A To communicate. 
Q About what --
A We stayed there till later that night too, just patrolling the streets until 
13 everybody was cleared and got in their cars. 
14 Q Okay. And at some point, was there also --did you go to a --like a hotel 
15 lobby for some sort of social event? 
16 
17 
18 A Yes, sir. 
Q Okay. When did that happen? 
A That was at --when we finally --everything was finished. We got done. 
19 We went to the hotel lobby where they were having drinks and stuff like that there. 
20 And there was all kinds of people there. And I --pardon me? 
21 Q Did that happen --you just described that after you downloaded Signal, for a 
22 period of time in the evening, you were kind of going around different areas. Is 
23 that --maybe that was --
24 
25 A Yes, sir. 
Q Okay. And what were you doing when you were --when you were doing  21 
1 that? What was the purpose? 
2 A Just making sure that everybody made it to their cars and make sure that 
3 everything was, you know --nobody was getting hurt or no damage was being done. It 
4 was --it was quiet. It was actually boring. 
5 Q Did anybody tell you what you were, like, protecting against as you were 
6 taking people to their cars or --
7 
8 
9 A Just any kind of violence. 
[Reporter asked for clarification.] 
Mr- Okay. Let's just pause --Mr. Marchisella, let's just pause for one 
10 second until or after I finish my question before you start speaking, and I'll try to not 
11 speak over you also. 
12 
13 
14 
15 Mr. Marchisella. Sorry about that. 
Mr- No, that's okay. 
BYMR .• 
Q So you said that you were watching out or trying to prevent any violence or 
16 anything happening to folks as they were walking to their car. Who were you worried 
17 was going to cause that violence? 
18 A Had no idea who, where, what. Just it would --they --you know, if you 
19 looked at the TV, it was coming from everywhere. Can't identify no --no group or a 
20 direct individual. 
21 Q Did Mr. Rhodes say anything about what you should watch out for, or did he 
22 just say walk these people to their cars? 
23 A Just walk --walk to the cars. He never looked --he never said look out for 
24 anything. 
25 Q Okay. All right. And so when you finished that, that's when you went to  1 the hotel lobby area? 
2 
3 
4 A Yes, sir. 
Q And tell me about the hotel lobby. What did you see there? 
A I seen a lot of different people, a lot of Oath Keepers. Again, the --the 
5 Three Percent, there was people there, Three Percent. Is that what you called them 
6 before? The Three Percent? 
7 Q Three Percenters. 
8 
9 
10 A 
Q 
A Okay. And then there was the 1776. Is that correct? That group? 
I think that is the name of one of the groups, yeah. 
Yes. And then just different people. And that's basically where I met 
11 the --the only reason why I remember that Alex or Ali guy is that he came over and was 22 
12 shaking everybody's hands, telling us thank you, and basically for --I'm thinking to myself 
13 for what? You know, there was nothing happened here. 
14 Q And he came over --it was to a group of Oath Keepers? 
15 A Pardon me? 
16 Q Did he come over to a group of Oath Keepers to thank them? 
17 A Really, I sat in the lobby --me and my wife just sat there alone basically, and 
18 we --and Dave was there. And we never engaged, really, in any of the little groups 
19 around us, because we're new. I mean, I was like, what --1 don't even know what's 
20 going on here, you know what I'm saying? Everybody's talking and shaking hands and 
21 drinking. 
22 And that's when Mr. Ali there came over where we were sitting, shook hands, said 
23 thank you. Thank you for --you know, the security, and stuff like that. 
24 
25 And, basically, that was it. That's how I recognized his face and his name. 
Q And anybody else that was sort of, you know, a notable person or famous  23 
1 individual we could call or well-known individual that you remember meeting on that 
2 day? 
3 A Don't know his name, but there was a blond-haired gentleman that was with 
4 him in a suit and tie. And never seen him before, but he seemed to be --again, I'm 
5 assuming, but it seemed to be of importance. But he was blond-haired, young guy. 
6 Q Young guy. Okay. I was going to ask --I thought maybe when you said 
7 blond hair, we might be talking about silver hair, might be talking about Roger Stone. 
8 Do you know who Roger Stone is? 
9 
10 A No. Matter of fact, no. I couldn't identify Roger Stone right now. 
Q Okay. And what was this lobby meeting? Was it just like a cocktail hour 
11 or a social event? 
12 
13 
14 A That's correct. 
Q Okay. 
Mr.- Okay. Let's pause for one second. Let's actually just go off the 
15 record at 11:06 and pause. 
16 [Discussion off the record.] 
17 BYMR-
18 Q I wanted to ask you again just quickly about the Proud Boys. I know you 
19 said that you couldn't identify them there, but did you say you knew they were there? 
20 
21 
22 A Yes, sir. 
Q Okay. And how did you know that they were there? 
A I heard guys talking that there was some Proud Boys there and basically --I 
23 never heard of the Three Percenters or the 76ers till that day. I heard of the Proud 
24 Boys. 
25 Q And what were folks saying about the Proud Boys?  24 
A As far as that day? 
Q Yeah. 
A No. That was it. Basically it. 
Q Just that they were there? 
A Nothing you could put a top on. 1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 Q Okay. And then, for Mr. Roger Stone, let me just clarify that too. Did you 
7 say you would not recognize Roger Stone if you saw him? 
8 A No. I --I don't --I don't know Roger Stone. In other words, they --again, I 
9 heard later, after the --you hear the names, that he was there. I heard that he drove by 
10 in a car. I did not see him. And if I did, I didn't know it was him. 
11 Q Okay. Gotcha. Thanks. Thanks for that clarification. 
12 
13 A Yes, sir. 
Q Okay. After Mr. Rhodes told you to download Signal, was he also at that 
14 lobby meeting, cocktail hour? 
15 
16 
17 A Yes, sir. 
Q Okay. Did you talk to him at all on that occasion? 
A I think briefly. It was a --as a group. He was talking to guys as a group, 
18 just saying thanks, good job, and, you know, stuff like that. Small talk. 
19 Q So let's talk a little bit about your interactions with Mr. Rhodes, either 
20 communications on Signal or phone calls after that Atlanta rally. When was the next 
21 time that you remember talking to Mr. Rhodes? 
22 A It was, I believe, if I'm not mistaken, it was Signal or a phone call. He was 
23 asking if we could find local members. 
24 
25 Q And so he wanted you basically to start recruiting --
A Yes, sir.  1 
2 
3 
4 Q --around South Carolina? 
A Yes, sir. 
Q And did he explain, you know, why that was or what he was trying to do? 
A No, sir, because the only thing I was thinking was getting more members. 
5 Q Okay. And I just wanted to ask --I forgot to ask earlier. You said when 25 
6 you initially paid dues, it was about $1,200. What period of time --was that like a yearly 
7 due or --
8 
9 
10 
11 A Lifetime. 
Q Do you know when --do you know if David paid that lifetime dues amount? 
A I have no idea, sir. 
Q And then, so Mr. Rhodes basically asked you to grow the numbers of the 
12 South Carolina Oath Keepers. How did that go? 
13 A Not --not --nobody was really interested. I think --the only person that 
14 did come was the guys that were there, and they came off --that --they came off of the 
15 Oath Keeper chat room on the website. 
16 
17 Q So those were preexisting members? 
A Oath Keepers. Oh, yes, sir. Some of the --all the guys that I knew there 
18 were there for years. 
19 
20 Q What did you try to do to recruit members, if anything? 
A I just talked to guys I know that was military or law enforcement, like that. 
21 Basically, that was it. I didn't give it a whole lot of attention, but I did ask people, and 
22 they were, no, not at this time. 
23 Q So no new members, but you guys did start again to meet with some 
24 regularity on Mondays, I think you said? 
25 A Yeah. I attended --I attended five meetings.  26 
1 Q All right. And just tell me about those meetings. What were they like and 
2 what did you discuss? 
3 A Not to be --no pun intended, but, like I said, it was like being at the VFW on 
4 wing night. 
5 
6 Q 
A Right. So pretty informal? 
Yes. Mostly talking about their experiences in the military or law 
7 enforcement. 
8 
9 Q 
A So they're sharing war stories and fishing stories? 
Yes, sir. And I sat there like a lump on a log. I even told my wife, I said, 
10 I'm going to go a couple more of these and I ain't going back, because I'm just --I can't 
11 relate to these guys. 
12 Q Were --other than talking about their time in their prior service, were these 
13 guys talking about current events, like politics and the election? 
14 A Yes, sir. There was talks about politics and the election. Yes, sir, there 
15 was. 
16 Q And what do you recall of those discussions? 
17 A Just --really not recalling nothing. The same old regurgitated stuff you 
18 hear all the time. Nothing that really stands out to me. 
19 Q And can you tell me what, if any, what feelings you had about the election 
20 and what your involvement in politics was at that time? 
21 A Never been involved in politics in my life. It was the first time I ever 
22 registered to vote in my life. Yeah. Basically it. I mean --I mean, I hate to sound so 
23 ignorant about this, but I was as new as new could get. 
24 
25 Q 
A Did Mr. Rhodes join for any of your Monday meetings? 
Yes, he did.  27 
Q And how did he join? Was he there in person or did he call in? 
A No, sir. He'd call in. 
Q All right. And when --how many times did he do that? 
A Once. 
Q Do you recall when that was? 1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 A Yes. Right before December --right before we went up December. I can't 
7 remember the exact date. If you look at the Monday before the 6th, that was the date. 
8 Q Okay. And I think you said right before you went up in December. Do you 
9 mean right before you went up in January? 
10 
11 A January, I meant, sir. 
Q So Wednesday --January 6th was a Wednesday, so January 4th was the 
12 Monday before? 
13 
14 A Yes, sir. That was it. That was at that meeting. 
Q And let's --well, one thing I'll ask you actually. Did you ever have a 
15 conversation with Mr. Rhodes again about recruitment, like about the fact that you 
16 couldn't find any more members? 
17 A No. Well, he was basically nonchalant about that. He told me to keep 
18 trying. I did say, you know --he said, You got any new members? 
19 
20 
21 
22 I said, Everybody that's here has been members already. 
Q And how big was that group that came together to meet on Mondays? 
A Anywhere from three to five guys. 
Q All right. And let's talk about that January 4th meeting that Mr. Rhodes 
23 joined for. What was the topic of that meeting or what did you guys discuss that day? 
24 A He was main --mostly concerned about who was going to the --to the 
25 December 6th.  28 
1 Q When had you all started discussing the possibility of going up for 
2 January 6th? 
3 
4 A When they sent that --a call --that call --the alert call out on email. 
Q And how did you talk with the other local guys about going up? Was that 
5 through Signal or --
6 
7 A Signal, phone, text, just normal stuff like that that was local. 
Q Okay. And who --if we can go through for the names that you remember, 
8 can you tell me who the local guys were that --
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 A Yeah. Absolutely. 
Q --were going to go up for the 6th? 
A Yes, sir. Of course I can tell you. 
Q Sure. What were their names? 
A Well, I know David Kirk --
Q Yeah. 
A --personally. I know Bob. 
Q Actually, you know what? Why don't we --let me --I am going to pull up 
17 another exhibit. 
18 
19 A Okay. 
Q And hold on one second. I think this'll help us with the names. You can 
20 just tell me if this is a pretty complete or close to complete list. One second. 
21 So I'm pulling up what's been marked as exhibit 5, and this is an email --you were 
22 not on this email, so I'm just going to explain it a little bit. This was an email sent on 
23 January 4th from a man named Stephen Brown, who is part of a company called Resource 
24 Group that was an event organizer, and this is to Ali Alexander, who we've talked about. 
25 And in that email, he says to Mr. Alexander, This is the list of PSD we're having  1 working with us, and their names, nicknames from Signal. 
2 
3 
4 A 
Q Okay. 
And then he mentions that Gator or Kelly Meggs is the leader of the team. 
And then, if we scroll down, there's a long list with, on the left, some 
5 names --user names from Signal, and on the right, given names and last names. And 
6 one of them here is the Signal name Paddy Master Diver, and next to it is your name, 
7 Frank Marchisella. 
Yes, sir. 
Is that your Signal user name? 
That's my email. 
Okay. Is it also your user name on Signal or was it? 
I guess it was, yes, sir. I thought my user name was Frank Marchisella. 29 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Are you --and I should have asked first. Can you see this exhibit? Do you 
14 want me to zoom in a little bit? 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 A 
Q Yeah. Make it bigger. 
Okay. 
Ms. Crick. It might be best to read it out to you. Let us know. 
Mr. Marchisella. Okay. Yeah. I can see my name. Okay. Yes, sir. 
BYMR. 
Q Okay. And it's got some State designations on the farther right here where 
21 the cursor is, and they say South Carolina. And the first one that's noted is a guy named 
22 Bruce --
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A Yes, sir. 
--Bruce Holden. 
I know Bruce.  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 Q And he is part of the Monday VFW wing night? 
A Yes, sir. 
Q Okay. And then there's your name. Then we've got Robert Kennedy? 
A 
Q Yep. Bob. We called him Bob. 
Bob. 
6 And then tell me if any of these people are not part of your local group. 
7 Darren Bassett? 
8 A Darin is --was --or he wasn't there every time, but he was part of the 
9 meetings sometimes, yes. 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Okay. And then David Kirk? 
Yes, sir. 
Gotcha. And David's the one that went down with you to Atlanta? 
Yes, sir. 
So that's --that's five guys: Bruce, Bob, Darin, David, and you. 
Yes, sir. 
That's pretty much the whole group? 
That's it. 
Okay. 30 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 A There was a couple guys came and go, but I could not identify or know their 
names. 
Q And did all five of these folks end up going up for January 6th? 
A Yes, sir. 
Q Okay. And were they all present for the January 4th meeting that 
24 Mr. Rhodes called into? 
25 A Yes, sir. He called on Robert's phone.  31 
1 Q All right. And then, just tell me what it was that Mr. Rhodes wanted to talk 
2 about at that meeting. 
3 A He wanted to know who was going to attend and be going to Washington, 
4 D.C., on December 6th. And he wanted to say hello to the guys, and that's what he did. 
5 Q Did he tell you at all what --what you would be doing or why he was 
6 interested in whether or not you were coming up? 
7 
8 A Security. 
Q And in that email, we used the --I used the term or the acronym "PSD." Is 
9 that private security detail? 
10 
11 A Yes, sir. 
Q Okay. And so that's the sort of work that Mr. Rhodes expected you to do 
12 up there? 
13 
14 
15 A Yes, sir. 
Q And what did that entail, to your understanding? 
A Was to watch --make sure that speakers were protected in any way, shape, 
16 or form, like anybody else would be protected that's stating an opinion that --I wasn't --I 
17 didn't care about their opinion. I was there in property, public and private. 
18 Q And what did Mr. Rhodes tell you about that work? Like, did he talk about 
19 what you should do to prepare to provide security? 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 A Not till we got there. 
Q Okay. What else did you talk about at the January 4th meeting? 
A Basically, that was about it, sir. 
Q How about like equipment you should bring or what you --
A Oh, yes. 
Q --should wear?  32 
1 A Yeah. There was lists. Do not --you know, yes. There was equipment, 
2 protection equipment and stuff like this. And, oh, we were definitely encouraged to 
3 wear Oath Keeper patches, as many as we could put on. 
4 
5 
6 mouth. 
7 Q And why was that? 
A I don't know. That's what --that's what Stewart Rhodes said out of his own 
Q Okay. It sounded like Mr. Rhodes wanted people to know that you were 
8 Oath Keepers, though? 
9 A Yes, sir. Evidently, yes, sir, because, I mean, that was a direct statement 
10 from him saying, Wear all the Oath Keeper patches you can put on --your hat, your 
11 sleeves, your shirt, your jacket, whatever. 
12 Q And did he give you any sort of plan about, you know, where you would 
13 meet up or how you would meet the other Oath Keepers once you got there? 
14 
15 
16 
17 A No, sir. We were totally in the dark till we got there. 
Q And so I know at this time you have Signal. 
A Uh-huh. 
Q And there were different group chats that you could --that you can join or 
18 that sometimes you were added to. Is that right? 
19 A Yes, sir. My understanding, I think you had to be added to them. I'm not 
20 sure about exactly how that works. 
21 Q Okay. Can you tell me the different types of group chats that you 
22 remember being on? 
23 A Yeah. It was Atlanta. I think it was D.C. I think the D.C. was merged 
24 with Florida. And North Carolina, if I'm not mistaken. 
25 Q And so do you mean there was a D.C. chat, and then, separately, there was  33 
1 one that was related to Florida and/or North Carolina? 
2 A Well, I don't think it was all related to the State. I think it was all related to, 
3 like, who the groups that were going, or who was going. And they talked amongst each 
4 other. They talked amongst each other. 
5 Q All related to going to January 6th, but then kind of based on where you 
6 were from --
7 
8 A Yes, sir. 
Q --and going to? Okay. 
9 That email that we looked at previously mentioned another Florida Oath Keeper 
10 named Kelly Meggs, and said that he was going to lead the security teams. 
11 Do you know who Kelly Meggs is? 
12 
13 
14 
15 A No, sir. 
Q Okay. Do you remember, from the Signal chats, a user name OK Gator 1? 
A I remember Gator 1, yes, sir. 
Q Okay. And what do you remember about him? 
16 A Just the name basically and just a bunch of chitchat that I really didn't pay 
17 attention to. But, no, I do remember the name Gator 1 and that he was from Florida. 
18 put, you know, two and two together, Florida, gator. 
19 Q On the January 4th call, you said that there was a list of things to bring and 
20 not to bring, right? 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 you --A Yes, sir. 
Q And what were the sorts of things that you were not supposed to bring? 
A Absolutely no weapons whatsoever into Washington, D.C. 
Q And when you say --when you say weapons, what --what particularly do  1 
2 
3 A Anything, from a toothpick up to whatever you got, I guess. Nothing. 
Q And then what was on the approved list? 
A Self-protection stuff. Knee pads, you know, vests, helmet, anything that 
4 could save your own life in case, you know, something like, you know, if you --violence 
5 somewhere, I guess. 
6 
7 any --
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 Q How about communications devices? Did you guys talk about radios or 
A Yes, sir. 
Q --way to communicate? 
A Yes, sir. 
Q And what was said about radios? 
A That the --the radios, they said, would be given out, but they never did. 
13 There was no radios given out. 
Q Okay. Did your group have or use any radios? 34 
14 
15 A No. Bob Kennedy had radios. We never used or got any radio. I never 
16 even seen a radio in Washington. 
17 Q Okay. And then, did Mr. Rhodes tell you --or, actually, let me ask this. 
18 Did --on that call, did you guys discuss where you might stay when you went up for the 
19 6th? 
20 A Yes, sir. I was told that there was a room at the hotel that we stayed. 
21 think it was the Comfort Inn. And I called and booked the rooms, yes, sir. 
22 Q Okay. Does it sound --the Comfort Inn in Ballston? Does that sound 
23 right? 
24 A Yes, sir, that sounds right. 
25 Q And that was discussed on the January 4th call?  35 
No, sir. 
When did you hear about the Comfort Inn? 1 
2 
3 A 
Q 
A That was --that came from the gentleman in North Carolina off a Signal chat, 
4 said there was hotel rooms available at the Comfort Inn. Like, I guess he was beaming it 
5 out to whoever. 
6 
7 
8 Q 
A 
Q Do you recall his name or his user name? 
Paul's all I know. 
Paul? Was it --
9 A Yes, sir. 
10 Q Does Paul Stamey sound right, or do you know --
11 A I didn't know his last name, sir. 
12 Q If it was on Signal, I can tell you his Signal user name was Western State 
13 Leader. Does that sound familiar? 
14 A No, sir, it does not sound familiar. 
15 
16 
17 Q 
A 
Q Okay. So just --you just knew it as Paul from North Carolina? 
Yes, sir. 
And what --did he say anything else? Was it just there are hotel rooms 
18 available here or --
19 A Hotel rooms available at the Comfort --because I think there was a lot of 
20 chatter on there about there was no place to stay, and people bringing tents. And that's 
21 when I said, I ain't going up there and sleeping in no tent at 30 degrees. I ain't doing it. 
22 So that's when somebody said something about there's hotel rooms available, and 
23 that's --we got two of them. 
24 
25 Q 
A And do you recall about when you booked those hotel rooms? 
No, sir, I don't. It would --had to be right about --not --not long after we  36 
1 got that call to action. 
2 Q Okay. I want to ask you or kind of introduce a term and ask you about it a 
3 little bit. Do you know what I mean when I say --use the term "QRF"? 
4 
5 
6 
7 A I did not know --I had no idea what a QRF was. I do now. 
Q Okay. And what do you know --what is a QRF? 
A A place where they keep weapons. 
Q And when Paul told you about the Comfort Inn, was there any mention of a 
8 quick reaction force, or a QRF? 
9 A No, sir. I heard a statement, something about a bus outside. there was 
10 chatter about that. 
11 
12 
13 Q And was that from the North Carolina Oath Keepers? 
A If I'm not mistaken, it was North Carolina and Florida communicating. 
Q Do you remember which of the chats that was or what that chat was 
14 named? 
15 
16 A No, sir, I do not. 
Q So you mentioned that a QRF is a place where weapons are stored. Did 
17 you and the South Carolina --other South Carolina Oath Keepers bring any firearms to 
18 D.C.? 
19 
20 A 
Q No, sir. 
Not to D.C. Not to D.C. Let me clarify. To the area. Did you bring 
21 them up with you for the trip? 
22 
23 
24 A Yes, sir. 
Q Okay. And what sort of firearms did you bring? 
A I had my AR-15 that I was going to use for the target shooting later. Was 
25 never even engaged whatsoever in that. Then of course I carried my personal firearm,  1 which is a .45 Smith & Wesson. 
2 Q And then, the other four that traveled, did they have --do you know what 
3 they were --what they brought? 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 A I --no, I do not know what they brought. I know what I saw. 
Q Okay. What did you see? 
A AR-15s. 
Q Okay. And each person had an AR-15? 
A Yes, sir. 
Q And then how about a personal firearm? Did you see --
A I have no idea. I didn't see none, and I didn't ask. 
Q Who booked the two rooms in the Comfort Inn? 
A I did. 
Q Did you guys split --just split the cost of that? 
A No, sir. I paid for it. 
Q Oh, man. 
A Nobody else had any money, I don't think. 
Q Yeah. You've got to go back and Venmo those guys. 
A 
Q 
A I know. Yes. 
Did you guys bring spouses or was it just you all? 
Just us. No spouses. 
Q Why didn't you bring any spouses? 
A Mine had to work. I don't know what their reasons were. 37 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 Q All right. Let's talk about the trip up to northern Virginia, the Comfort Inn. 
24 How did you guys get up there? 
25 A SUV.  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 Q Whose SUV did you take? 
A Mine. 
Q And did you all drive together or were there multiple cars? 
A All drove together. 
Q All right. Well, just --why don't you tell me about the trip up there. So 
6 when did you leave? When did you arrive? 
7 A The 5th morning, we left pretty early, got there later that 5th afternoon. 
8 Basically, just pretty humdrum drive, just nothing exciting there at all. 38 
9 Q And then once you got there on the 5th --sorry. Tell me again what time. 
10 Did you say noon or afternoon? 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 A Afternoon. 
Q Afternoon. 
A Yes, sir. 
Q And you checked into the Comfort Inn, I take it, when you got there? 
A Yes, sir. 
Q What did you --where did you store the firearms that you just described? 
A Mine --my firearms was under lock in a bag. 
Q And was that in the car or in the hotel? 
A From the car to the hotel, yes, sir. 
Q Okay. So while you were --while you were staying at the Comfort Inn and 
21 in and out, your stuff was in your bag? 
22 
23 
24 
25 A I didn't leave anything in the car. 
Q Okay. 
A I didn't leave anything in the car. 
Q Okay. So once you arrived in D.C., checked into the Comfort Inn, did  39 
1 everybody move their firearms from the car into the Comfort Inn? 
2 A Long --the long rifles or the --yes, I seen them go in. But, again, I don't 
3 know what other weapons they had. 
Q Okay. Just what you saw --
A Yes, what I saw --4 
5 
6 Q As far as you know --just a reminder, try to let me finish the statement, just 
7 for the court reporter. 
8 So of what you saw, everybody brought whatever firearms they carried from the 
9 car into the hotel? 
10 
11 A Yes, sir. 
Q Okay. And so, then, what did you guys do that afternoon once you were 
12 checked in and had everything moved into the room? 
13 A Basically got everything, you know, organized, and then took an Uber to 
14 the --into Washington. 
15 
16 Q And what did you --what did you take an Uber into Washington for? 
A To go to the --let's see. What was the --Freedom Plaza, was it? Where 
17 the speakers were being held, is that what it was, the Freedom Plaza? 
18 Q Yeah. That's Freedom Plaza in D.C. where most of the speakers were on 
19 the 5th. 
20 
21 
22 A Yeah. 
Q And what did you all do at Freedom Plaza? 
A Basically just sat around there, wondered --you know, tried to get a hold of 
23 somebody to meet, and then finally, Stewart said he'd be there in a little bit, and we 
24 waited on him there. And then that's when we seen him, Kellye, and Whip come --met 
25 us at the statue of the horse.  40 
1 
2 Q And what happened after that meeting or once you guys met up with them? 
A We walked around the speakers, like the --I guess security, walking around. 
3 And then that's when Kellye, Stewart, Bruce, and myself --Stewart said, Let's go --go back 
4 to the hotel room. So I figured it was the hotel he was staying. I wasn't sure. I didn't 
5 ask. And so we walked to the hotel, and that's where we met a young lady and two 
6 other young ladies and escorted them to a parking garage. 
7 Q Let's rewind just a little bit. While you're at Freedom Plaza, I think you said 
8 you were walking around and doing security. Is that correct? 
9 
10 
11 A Yes, sir. Yep. Walking around, staying with the speakers. 
Q What did doing security mean? 
A Just walking around with the --you know, walking around where the 
12 speakers were. 
13 
14 Q And can you describe for me what you were wearing on the 5th? 
A Yes. My khaki jacket. What's a Carhartt jacket and pants, and work 
15 boots, and a hat. That was basically it. I think knee pads and some gloves. 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 Q And did you have like a facemask or anything at the time? 
A Yes. You had the COVID mask and --
Q Was that just like a mask or did you have a gator type thing? 
A Yeah. It was like a gator type thing that went around your head. 
Q And then how about Bruce? Do you remember what Bruce was wearing? 
A He had, I think, a jacket, hat, and, again, a gator thing around his face. 
Q All right. Did Bruce have knee pads? 
A I can't remember. 
Q Okay. Do you remember the color of his --
A Green.  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 Q --jacket and pants? 
A Green. 
Q Green. And yours were --sorry --khaki. Is that what you said? 
A It's like light brown. It was Carhartts. Carhartt jacket and pants. 
Q That standard Carhartt color? 
A Yes, sir. 
Q All right. So you walked around the plaza --you walked around the plaza 
8 on the 5th with Rhodes, Kellye, and --Kellye SoRelle --and Whip, and then you guys 
9 walked from the Freedom Plaza to a hotel, you said? 
10 A Yes, sir. 41  1 [11:36 a.m.]

A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q And do you recall the name of the hotel? 
No. I keep wanting to say Phoenix in my head for some reason. 
Was it the Phoenix Park Hotel? 
It could be, yes. 
Does that sound right? Okay. 
Yes, sir. 
And, then, I think you said you met one woman --well, three women, I 
Yeah, three women. 
Do you recall their names? 
No, sir, I don't. 
If I gave you some names, might you recognize them? 
Probably not, sir, no, but you can try, but I don't know their names. 
Does the name Bianca Gracia ring a bell at all? 
No, sir. 
Did you hear anybody discussing an organization called Latinos for Trump? 
Yes, but this was after the fact. 
All right. Actually, why don't I do this, I'll show you a picture, and you can 
21 tell me if you recognize the individual. So I'm going to pull up what we've marked as 
22 exhibit 2. And this is a photograph of a couple of people at that hotel that we just 
23 mentioned, the Phoenix Park Hotel. And was one of the women that you met this 
24 individual in the white sweater? 
25 A Yes, sir. That's her. 42  43 
1 Q Okay. So, just as we talk this through, I'll represent to you, her name is 
2 Bianca Gracia. 
A Okay. 
Q And so you met Bianca with two other women? 
A Yes, sir. 3 
4 
5 
6 Q And you met her at the hotel. And then did you guys stay at the hotel at all 
7 or just pick her up? 
8 A No, just picked --it was very brief, and then that's when Stewart told me and 
9 Bruce to come on, and that's where we walked them three women to the parking garage. 
10 
11 Q 
A Did you go into the hotel at all? 
Yeah, the second --when we came back, I did. I can't remember. I think 
12 we did for briefly when we met them, but it was pretty quick. 
13 Q All right. And then you walked them to the garage. About how far from 
14 the hotel was the garage? 
15 A It felt like a mile to me, but it was --it was a --not --a pretty good clip, I 
16 guess. 
17 Q And are we talking about the distance from Freedom Plaza to the hotel or 
18 hotel to the garage? 
19 A Hotel to the garage. It was both ways. It seemed like a long time. It 
20 seemed like a long haul to me. 
21 
22 Q All right. And then what happened when you got to the garage? 
A When we got to the garage, there was people there already. Immediately I 
23 thought we were walking --I thought originally we were walking these ladies to a car. 
24 Well, immediately she embraced a gentleman that was there, that that same lady in 
25 White, and the other two also embraced him. And then Stewart started talking to him.  44 
1 And then we basically sat down, and it was some like reporters there or whatever. And 
2 sort of Kelly was sitting there talking to us with reporters and everything, me and Bruce. 
3 And, basically, that was it. And then Stewart was having a conversation with a 
4 gentleman at this time. We didn't know who this was at the time. 
5 Q As far as members of the Oath Keepers that were there, it was just you and 
6 Bruce and Mr. Rhodes? 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 talked? 
12 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A And Kelly. 
And Kelly. Yeah, okay. 
Yes, sir. 
All right. And then what did you do while you were there when they 
Small talk, smoked cigarettes, talked to Bruce, talked to reporters, stuff like 
13 that. We were there about 15, 20 minutes maybe. 
14 
15 
16 Q 
A 
Q Do you remember anything about what was discussed? 
No, sir. 
And then I don't think we talked too much about Bruce. Can you just tell 
17 me about Bruce? 
18 A Bruce I met a total at that time --well, I've never seen Bruce since then. So 
19 I have probably seen Bruce maybe four --four to five times I talked to him. He seemed 
20 like a nice gentleman. Air Force. I believe he is Air Force and a real religious guy. 
21 Q Okay. And I think you said there is --did one of the members of the South 
22 Carolina Oath Keepers that you traveled with, did one of them have some specialty or 
23 expertise with radios? 
24 
25 A 
Q Yes. 
Okay. And that's Bob?  45 
A Yes. 
Q Okay. And that's Bob --
A Yes. 
Q --is that correct? 
A Yes. He was a Navy, a Navy fighter pilot. 1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 Q Okay. We'll come back to that. I was just making sure I was getting these 
7 guys straight in my mind. Okay. So, after they met in the garage, where did you guys 
8 go after that? 
9 
10 
11 A We went back to the Phoenix. 
Q And why did you go back to the Phoenix? 
A We ate, probably stayed there maybe an hour or so, and then Ubered back 
12 to our hotel room. 
13 Q And this --I'll pull this exhibit 2 back up real quick. Zoom out. All right. 
14 So is this the room in the Phoenix Park Hotel that you all went to? 
15 
16 A Yes, sir. 
Q Okay. And this picture, there is kind of a group of people here. We've 
17 already identified Ms. Gracia. Sitting next to her, is that Kelly Sorrell? 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 is? 
23 A Yes, sir. 
Q Do you know who the man in the hat behind her is? 
A I never seen him before or after or since then. 
Q And then the woman, the third woman in the photo, do you know who she 
A I don't know who she is. I think she is some kind of political figure because, 
24 while I was there, they were live-streaming. That's why they were sitting in like that 
25 position. They were live-streaming that, I don't know how or where, but she was  46 
1 talking. And I believe she is a political --something to do with some kind of political with 
2 Virginia. 
3 
4 
5 Q All right. And then that's Stewart Rhodes holding the cup next to her? 
A That's correct. 
Q Okay, and while you were there, and I think you said you guys ate. You 
6 ordered pizza; am I correct? 
7 
8 
9 A I think there was pizza there yes, yeah. 
Q So they did some sort of like panel discussion on Facebook live stream? 
A I think it --I don't know where it was going to, but, yes, there was guys 
10 sitting to my left. If you'll see that, if I'm not mistaken, there is a little hand right 
11 there --a hand right there with that cord? 
12 Q Yeah. 
13 A That's me videoing that. And the guy to the left of me was streaming them 
14 live. 
15 Q Do you remember anybody else, or do you remember anything about 
16 anybody else that was in that room? 
17 
18 
19 A Yeah, I do remember the guy behind Stewart. 
Q And who's that? 
A I have no idea who he is, but I know he was saying something about that he 
20 was arrested before at a rally. I don't know why I remember --I heard him talking to 
21 somebody about that. 
22 Q Did you hear anybody discuss their affiliation with any particular groups 
23 because like, obviously, you were an Oath Keeper there. I'll represent to you that Ms. 
24 Gracia was with an organization called Latinos for Trump. Do you remember hearing 
25 anybody discuss any type of similar groups or affiliations?  1 
2 
3 A 
Q 
A No, sir. 
About how many people were in the room, if you remember? 
Well, there was the other two young ladies that was with the lady in the 
4 white. They were in there somewhere. There was more than one room there. 
5 think there was like three rooms. And there was a couple other people in there, you 47 
6 know, just hovering around, pouring drinks, stuff like that. I couldn't identify them, or I 
7 had never them before or ever after either. 
8 
9 Q 
A Do you know whose room that was? 
No, I do not. I thought it was Stewart's, but I remember him mentioning 
10 when we got ready to leave, he said: I've get to get back to my hotel room. 
11 
12 
13 do? 
14 
15 
16 So that's when I knew it wasn't his. 
Q 
A 
Q 
A So, after this, well, panel discussion and pizza party ends; what did you all 
We went out front and waited for our Uber and then went back to our room. 
And you and Bruce went separately from Kelly and Mr. Rhodes? 
Yes, and that's when we met Dave and Bob and Darren. And then we all 
17 went together. Because Bob paid for all the Ubers. So he called Uber and picked us all 
18 up. 
19 Q Do you know what Dave and Bob and Darren were doing while you were 
20 with Mr. Rhodes? 
21 
22 A 
Q I have no idea, sir. 
All right. And then you think Mr. Rhodes and Ms. Sorrell just went back to 
23 their hotel afterwards? 
24 A I would say so because he said he had to get back to his hotel is what he 
25 said. And that was the last --last anything I've heard from him on that evening.  48 
1 Q Okay. All right. Throughout this day on January 5th and throughout the 
2 activities that we were just discussing, were you also talking with other Oath Keepers 
3 about what you were going to be doing tomorrow, or were you trying to figure out what 
4 would go on tomorrow or the next day? 
5 A No, sir. I didn't talk to anybody about the next day. We just know we 
6 were going to D.C. to provide security for the speakers. 
7 Q And, at that point, did you know where you were supposed to meet or when 
8 you were supposed to meet the next day? 
9 
10 
11 A No, sir. 
Q How did you find that out? 
A Well, one of the other guys was chatting with some people, I can't 
12 remember which one, and we Ube red --actually we Ube red to the --now we're on the 
13 6th, right? 
14 
15 
16 Q Yeah, we're on the 6th now? 
A Well, we Ubered to the wrong place. 
Q Okay. I guess, actually, before we move fully to the 6th, you just returned 
17 to your hotel room. Anything happen after that, or did you guys just go to bed? 
18 
19 A Went right to bed. Very tired. 
Q All right. So you said one of the South Carolina Oath Keepers at some point 
20 was talking to somebody else, and they gave you a location --
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 A Yeah. 
Q --to meet up at? 
A Yes. 
Q Do you remember which one that was? 
A No, I don't.  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 Ms. Crick. Do you need a break. 
Mr. Marchisella. No. I'm good. 
BYMR. 
Q Okay. 
A 
Q Sorry. Go ahead. 
No, that's okay. I couldn't hear, Cindy, but I'm guessing since it's 11:48, 
7 we've been going for a little over an hour, do you all want to take a break? I'm happy 
8 to. 
9 A That's fine. 
10 Mr. Merting. It's clearly up to you,_ We're at a nice stopping point 
11 because we're switching days, so it does work. But we're all used to that. 
Mr. - Let's go off the record at 11:48, and we'll come back at 11:55. 
[Recess.] 
BYMR.-
Q Let's go back on the record at 11:55. And before we get to the 6th, 49 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 actually, I just wanted to ask you a quick question. We had talked about the Proud Boys 
17 in Atlanta. And I know you said you didn't see any, but you kind of knew who the Proud 
18 Boys were and were told that they were there. Do you ever remember any other 
19 conversations with Oath Keepers about Proud Boys? 
20 
21 A No, sir. 
Q Okay. I wanted to ask in one of the exhibits which are the Signal chats. 
22 I'm going to pull up what's marked as exhibit 6. And this is one of those Signal chats you 
23 mention that you're on. This is the D.C. op Jan 6 Signal chat. And if we can see this. 
24 And you may or may not remember this, but let's --hopefully this refreshes your 
25 recollection a little bit. On this message right here, it's from OK Gator 1, who we have  1 talked about is Kelly Meggs, the Florida Oath Keeper. And he is posting to the Signal 
2 chat a tweet from a guy named Matt Couch. Do you know who Matt Couch is? 
3 
4 A No, sir. 
Q And he is noting that the leader of the Proud Boys, Enrique Tarrio, was 
5 arrested in D.C. And that arrest happened on January 4th. Can you read these 
6 messages. So this is repost from Kelly Meggs of this Matt Couch tweet. And Meggs, 50 
7 basically, lets everybody know that Mr. Tarrio's been arrested. And then you responded 
8 to that message: Wow. 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 Do you remember Mr. Tarrio's arrest or anything about that? 
A I remember, but I thought it --what day was that? 
Q That was on January 4th. 
A Oh. 
Ms. Crick. Do you need him to read that out to you? 
Mr. Marchisella. Which one? 
15 Ms. Crick. And remember,_ if he is not using his thing, his translator for 
16 dyslexia, we have to read this out, or you do. 
17 Mr.- Oh, sure. I'm happy to do that. 
18 BY MR 
19 Q So the Matt Couch tweet just says: Leader of the Proud Boys and my friend 
20 Enrique Tarrio is being arrested for a misdemeanor in Washington, D.C., as he just landed 
21 at the airport. They are arresting him for taking the fall for the burning of the Black 
22 Lives Matter banner at the last event per Joe Biggs on the phone. 
23 And then, in this version, some of Mr. Meggs' messages cut out. But basically he 
24 says he tried to call Mr. Tarrio, and he didn't answer. And then he said he'll call if he's 
25 out. That's that last message from Meggs. And then you responded: Wow.  51 
1 I just wanted to know if you remembered anything about Mr. Tarrio's arrest or 
2 any discussions about his arrest? 
3 A Yes, sir, and to be totally honest with you, I thought that was on the 5th that 
4 he got arrested. 
5 
6 
7 Q Okay. 
A I didn't know it was the 4th. 
Q Yeah, he was arrested on the 4th and then released on the 5th. What do 
8 you remember about his arrest or --
9 A That's all I --I heard that he brought a magazine into Washington. That's 
10 what I heard. 
11 Q Do you remember what you --you said "wow," so I take that to be kind of 
12 expression of some surprise. Do you remember what was surprising about that to you? 
13 
14 
15 
16 A That they arrested him for an empty magazine. 
Q Okay. Because that seems like a minor thing to you? 
A Yes, I thought so. 
Q The garage meeting that we just talked about on the 5th, were you aware 
17 that the individual that was there that embraced the three women, that that was Mr. 
18 Tarrio? 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 A Not at that time, sir, no. 
Q Okay. But you have since learned? 
A Yes. Not long after we left the garage. 
Q Okay. And how did you learn that it was Mr. Tarrio? 
A I heard people talking about it. 
Q And who was talking about it? 
A The people back at the hotel room.  1 
2 
3 
4 Q In the Phoenix Park Hotel? 
A Yes, sir. 
Q Do you remember who at the hotel room was talking about that? 
A The lady in the white and a couple of other people just chatting and talking 
5 about it and me sitting there listening. 
Q And what did they say about his arrest? 52 
6 
7 A Well, no --this wasn't talking about the arrest. That's when I learned that it 
8 was him, the leader of the Proud Boys. 
9 
10 
11 Q Oh, okay. What were they saying about him, then? 
A 
Q I don't really remember the conversations. 
Fair enough. All right. Then let's turn back to the 6th. So just take me 
12 through your morning of the 6th. 
13 A Oh, okay, we got up. I think we slept in because we were tired. And Bob 
14 called Uber. Bob paid for the food and Ubers. And he called Uber. I think we arrived 
15 in Washington around 10; I want to say about 10, 10:30 a.m. We got dropped off on a 
16 corner --I can't remember where --and then discovered that we were in the wrong place. 
17 And then we got --if I'm not mistaken, I can't remember if we got a ride from another 
18 Oath Keeper in the back of a truck. We went --I think this is it --and we got dropped off 
19 where the speakers were. I believe that's the case. And then --
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 Q Do you know how the --sorry, I will stop you there for one second. 
A Okay. 
Q Do you know how that Oath Keeper in the truck found you all? 
A He was there. 
Q Oh, he was --
A He was there.  53 
1 Q Okay. So, when you got dropped off with the Uber, he was there, and you 
2 all realized you were in the wrong place --
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Yes, sir. 
--and he said he would drive you to wherever you needed to go? 
Yes. So all of us piled into the back of his trunk. 
And was it just the South Carolina folks or were there --
Just the guys that was with us, yeah. Him and another gentleman was 
8 inside of the vehicle. 
12 
13 
14 
15 doing? Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A And do you know who those people were? 
--where the speakers were. 
Do you know who the two folks in the truck were? 
No. I know they were Oath Keepers because they had patches on. 
So, when you arrived where the speakers were, what did you all end up 
Okay. We went to where the stadium or the platform, and then behind the 
16 platform is where we met Stewart. Stewart was there with okay --Stewart handed out 
17 some blue tape to put around our right arm, you know, to make sure that --I think a 
18 couple guys --now they went with us --but a couple Oath Keepers were there that didn't 
19 have patches. And I think Stewart gave them patches, Oath Keeper patches. Okay. 
20 That's when he said to me and Bruce, he said: You guys go on the corners over here and 
21 the sidewalks and just, you know, stand, you know, alert, make sure, you know, 
22 everything is okay. 
23 Okay, we did. The other guy stayed behind the stadium, which there was a big 
24 TV. There was a big TV on there, and people were speaking. And that's basically it 
25 there until the next phase you want to ask.  54 
1 Q Yeah, I'll ask, so the two of you went and were just kind of doing that 
2 watch --again, watching out a little better or just monitoring a crowd. Is that what you 
3 said you were doing? 
4 
5 
6 
7 A 
Q 
A 
Q Yes, sir, a very small crowd. 
Were there any other people doing that sort of security work around there? 
I didn't see anybody else. 
Okay. Did you know the stage at --do you know who was speaking there 
8 or what group was at that stage? 
9 
10 A 
Q 
11 veterans? 
12 A Veterans. I think veterans. 
Was the organization called Veterans for Trump, or it was just a group of 
I didn't know the name of the group. I just know that they were veterans 
13 and people were speaking on --I didn't really pay attention to the conversations they 
14 were saying. 
15 Q And then we talked a little bit --when we talked about the January 4th 
16 meeting, we discussed radios and that there was some idea that they were going to be 
17 handed out to you guys and that you would get some radios. And I think you said that 
18 never happened, right? 
19 
20 
21 
22 A 
Q 
A 
Q That is correct. 
Did anybody on the 6th that you were with have a radio? 
No, sir. None of us had radios. 
Okay. And then why --I guess I'm just curious why Bob had some sort of 
23 radio specialty, right? 
24 A Yes, sir. Again, I think he was the Navy pilot, and he was in 
25 communications and stuff like that. And I think he had volunteered that. But it never  1 came to pass. 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 Q Okay. Do you know --did he --but he didn't bring any of his own radios? 
A Yes, he had his own radios. 
Q Okay. 
A But he didn't pass them out. 
Q Okay. Did he use a radio on the 6th? 
A No, sir. 
Q Okay. 
A I'll rephrase that. 
Q I guess I'm just a little bit confused. Bob had radios that he brought, but 
11 you never used them? 
12 A That's correct, sir. He said something about they needed to be 
13 programmed. 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 Q Did he bring them into D.C., or did he leave them at the hotel? 
A Brought them into D.C. 
Q And where did he keep the radios? 
A They were in a bag behind the stage. 
Q When you were here with Mr. Rhodes, do you remember anything about a 
19 bag of Mr. Rhodes' that he left? 
20 
21 
22 A Yes, sir. 
Q And what happened with that? 
A The bag --he --Mr. Rhodes must have told Bob or whoever or Dave or 
23 Darren, I don't know, to watch his bag. Because me and Bruce were out in the front, 
24 you know, we were away from them. So we don't know what happened once we did 
25 this. And, evidently, Stewart had left. I wasn't aware that Stewart left. No. And, 55  56 
1 evidently, in here --I need to jump --do I need to jump forward for the reason why? 
Q We'll talk about him asking about the bag later. 
A Yes, sir. But, evidently, he left the bag in their possession. 
Q Okay. And do you know what was in the bag? 
A No, sir, I do not. 
Q Can you describe the bag for me? Did you see it? 
A I never saw it. 2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 Q Okay. Other than the South Carolina group that you were with, were there 
9 any other Oath Keepers in that area? 
10 A When we first got there, yes, but then they disappeared. The only Oath 
11 Keepers that I recognize there were the guys that we came together. 
12 
13 
14 
15 Q All right. And then, at some point, did you reunite with the other three? 
A Yes, sir. We --
Q Okay. 
A Yes, they were behind the stage, and we would walk around. And then, 
16 after the crowd disperse was gone, we walked back toward the stage, and the other guys 
17 were there behind the stage. 
18 
19 
20 
21 Q 
A Do you have any idea about what time that was that the crowd dispersed? 
No, sir, not exact time. 
Q Were they walking towards the Capitol? Is that how they dispersed? 
A Well, no, it wasn't all at once. It was fading slow. And there wasn't that 
22 many people there to start with. 
23 Q How about do you remember in relation --do you remember President 
24 Trump speaking that day? 
25 A He was on that screen behind the speakers.  57 
1 Q And do you remember kind of in relation to his speech, did the crowd 
2 disperse while he was speaking or after he finished speaking? 
3 
4 A 
Q After he finished speaking, maybe 20 minutes after that. 
Okay. So you stayed in that area near the stage until at least 20 or 
5 30 minutes after his speech? 
6 
7 
8 A 
Q 
A Well, no, we were there longer. 
Okay. About how long did you stay in that area after his speech? 
After his speech, I'd say we were still walking around, me and Bruce, and the 
9 other guys were behind us, the stage. I would say we walked around another 
10 30 minutes or so, then met up with the guys behind. And Stewart --there was nobody 
11 else there at this time. And then we stayed there for another maybe 20 minutes, 
12 maybe. And that's when that gentleman came out from --I want to say a Virginia 
13 politician. 
14 Q When you say "walking around," you just mean walking around the stage 
15 like in a loop? 
16 
17 
18 A 
Q 
A Yes, sir. 
And, yeah, tell me about this encounter with the Virginia politician. 
Yes, sir, he came, he came from around the front of the stage. We were on 
19 the back now behind that monitor where Trump spoke. Okay. He came through, and 
20 he said: You guys, I think there's something going on at the Capitol. 
21 
22 
23 And I never said nothing. Everybody was going: Well, what's going on? 
He said: Well, let's go up there and find out what's going on. 
And there was another gentleman with him that was with him that had a beard. 
24 That's the two I remember. So we said: Okay. 
25 And so Bob stayed behind, and the rest of us, me, Dave, Bruce, and Darren,  58 
1 followed him and that bearded guy to the Capitol. 
2 Q All right. Let's pause there for one second. Let's try to talk about where 
3 that stage was that you guys were circling. Do you remember any landmarks that were 
4 near you? 
5 A No, see there was a building behind me --or behind the stage, there was a 
6 building, and then there was like a park. It had benches. 
7 Q How about the Washington Monument? You know what I'm talking about, 
8 the big obelisk --
9 
10 A 
Q I didn't see it. A lot of trees. 
Okay. Were you closer to the Capitol? Do you know where the 
11 Washington Monument is? 
12 
13 
14 day? 
15 
16 
17 
18 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q No, sir, not in relation to where we were at, no. 
Okay. Got it. Did you use any metro stops while you were there that 
Metro stops as far as buses or taxis? 
Metro as in train, the subway stations. 
No, sir. 
I was seeing if I can think of some landmarks for you and see if we could 
19 figure out where the stage was. 
20 A It was a veteran speaking. If we can narrow that down where the veterans 
21 were speaking, it will show you that, but I can't remember. 
22 Q All right. Well, we can probably locate it that way. I think I know where 
23 you're talking about. Okay. So this --do you remember why you thought he was a 
24 Virginia politician or an elected official? 
25 A That's what I can't remember because I really didn't pay attention. He was,  59 
1 like --here is what I gathered when he was speaking: He ran for something and didn't 
2 get elected. He was --this is what --he was --I don't know what he was as a politician. 
3 And then, when the revote came, he was elected out of it. And he was a speaker there, 
4 too, but I didn't see him speak. He must have spoke before we got there or, you know, 
5 one of those times I didn't notice. But he did have a guy with him that had a beard, 
6 about like yours, maybe longer. 
7 Q Let me --actually, let's pause for one second. I'm going to see --hold on 
8 one second. 
9 
10 A Sure. 
Ms. Crick. Sean, real quick, if I could leave your screen, it's because my laptop is 
11 going to die, but I'm still here in the room. 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 me to. Mr. - All right great. No problem. 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A BYMR.-
I might have a photo, and I just want to see maybe if we can identify. 
Oh, that would be great if you had his photo. I could remember his face. 
All right. Was it any of these individuals? I can zoom in more if you need 
Yeah, zoom in a little bit more. No. 
No? 
I don't know what the guy with the sunglasses and the hat looks like. But I 
21 know the two --the other two on my right, that's not them. And I think that one is a 
22 little more heavyset to my left than the guy that was there. I can't identify him with the 
23 sunglasses or toboggan on. 
24 Q So they lead you towards the Capitol or tell you something is going on at the 
25 Capitol. And were they encouraging you to go?  60 
1 A Yeah, they said --yes, they were as a matter of fact. It was like: Come on, 
2 let's go. 
3 
4 Q And then what happened when you got there? 
A Okay. We walked up there, and as soon as we got to the area right there 
5 where we decided to stop, he went forward, turned around and looked and seen we 
6 didn't want to go no further. He turned right around and walked right by and faded off 
7 in the crowd. And I remember distinctly him looking right at me and putting his arms 
8 out and tilt his head sideways and just like fell back into the crowd and disappeared. 
9 
10 
11 Q Interesting. 
A Yeah. 
Q So I want to --the video I had said we were going to play, I want to see if this 
12 is the area that you stopped in --
13 
14 A 
Q Okay. 
--if you recall. It's a 2-minute, 45 second video. We'll watch some of 
15 this. And I'll stop at various points and ask you some questions. 
16 
17 
18 
19 A Sure. 
Q But let's see, I think I need to --can you hear that at all? 
A Yes, sir. 
Q Hold on one second. I am going to --let's actually --let's take a break for 2 
20 or 3 minutes. There is a sound setting that I've had to mess with before to get this to 
21 work. So let's go into recess at 12:16, and we'll come back at 12:20, and we'll watch 
22 that video. We're in recess now. 
23 
24 [Recess.] 
Mr.- Then we can go back on the record at 12:23. So you've arrived at 
25 the, near the Capitol. And I want to play part of this video. We're going to play it, and  61 
1 then I'll tell --we've had Sandeep Prasanna join us. He is another investigative counsel 
2 with the committee. And I'll tell him when to stop, and I'll have a couple of questions 
3 for you. 
4 So if you can just play that,_ 
5 [Video shown.] 
6 BYMR.-
7 Q If we can pause. So, one, is that where you guys --does that look like the 
8 area that you stopped to hang out for a little bit? 
9 A Yes, sir, that was where --I think that's --I think that's the area we stopped 
10 at period. 
11 Q Okay. And then did you hear that bit at the end where somebody identifies 
12 that there is tear gas, it sounds like? 
13 
14 A Yes, sir. 
Q Then everybody kind of repeated "tear gas." Then the last person to say it, 
15 there was a little beep. There's a sound; we can replay it in a second. It sounded like 
16 maybe either a radio or were you using --was anybody using the Zella app? 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 A No, sir. 
Q Did you hear the beep that I'm talking about? 
A I did not. 
Q - if you can go back up 5 seconds and then just play it again. 
[Video shown.] 
BYMR.-
Q Awesome. If we can pause here. 
Are you able to hear it? Did you hear it that time? 
A Slightly, yes, sir, I did. But it could have been anybody around there.  62 
1 know it wasn't one of us. 
2 Q I was just going to ask, that wasn't a sound that you recognized or you didn't 
3 know? Do you remember anybody communicating to other people that tear gas was 
4 being used? 
5 
6 A No, sir. 
Q Okay. All right. And, then, let's keep playing for a little bit, Sandeep. 
7 [Video shown.] 
8 Mr. Quinn. Actually, pause it, - And let's go to the last about 
9 20 seconds of the video. Yeah, that should be good. And then let's play it here. 
10 [Video shown.] 
11 BY MR. 
12 Q All right. And pause. So there goes the end of the video. Did you hear 
13 that last bit where somebody --and it might have been the person holding the phone, 
14 which I think is you --said, "Hey, somebody, text Stewart, tell him --if tells us to do it, we 
15 can do an op"? Did you hear that? 
16 
17 
18 
19 A That wasn't me that said that. 
Q Okay. Do you know who said that? 
A 
Q It sounds like Dave Kirk (ph). 
Dave --okay. Was somebody texting with Stewart at that time, do you 
20 remember? 
21 
22 A They were trying and no reply. 
Q Okay. 
23 And then, Sandeep, if you can pull that video down, and that's all we need. 
24 Thanks for your help. 
25 I just wanted to ask you about that part. When David said "we can do an op," do  63 
1 you know what he would have been talking about, or what did that mean. 
2 A As a matter of fact, at that time, I didn't even hear that. I don't think we 
3 engaged in conversation on that. But I would think that he would have meant is there 
4 somewhere else we can go to, you know, like we did to start with around a rally or 
5 something. 
6 
7 
8 Q 
A 
Q Just to go be useful, tell us what to do basically? 
Yeah, exactly. 
Gotcha. 
9 A But there was no reply from that point on. I mean, really the last time we 
10 seen Stewart was behind that stage. And all the way up to that point there, we still had 
11 no idea what was going on, where we were at, why we were even there because that guy 
12 led us there, and basically that's it. I mean, until you're ready to move on, then I can tell 
13 you what happened from there. 
14 Q Okay. Great. Yeah, why don't you tell me what happened after --so, 
15 after you stayed in that area for a while, what happened? 
16 A Okay. We left there. We walked around the side of the Capitol to the 
17 other side where then that's where we seen Stewart. We seen Stewart. There wasn't 
18 as many people on this other side. And the first thing that happened, Stewart turned 
19 around and said we were all standing there. He said: Did you guys go in the Capitol? 
20 
21 And immediately we all said: No, no. 
And he turned around, and it sounded like he said "good," but he could have said 
22 anything. But then he turned around again angry, upset that we left his bag back at that 
23 other place where the stage was and mumbled --he was mumbling stuff, cussing, and 
24 stuff like that. And, basically, and then him --I believe it was him, David, and Darren 
25 went to go get his bag. Me and Bruce just stayed there. Like I said, there was nothing  64 
1 at all happening. There were some police officers there. Everything was pretty calm. 
2 Q Do you recall any other Oath Keepers other than the South Carolina folks 
3 and Stewart that were there when you saw Stewart? 
4 
5 
6 A Yes, sir. Plenty. A lot of them. 
Q Any ones that you remember by name or by Signal username? 
A I remember one gentleman backed to where we talked about Atlanta. 
7 Remember Atlanta? 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 Q Yeah. 
A Well, we jumped forward now. The Cuban guy from Atlanta was there. 
Q Okay. 
A Oh, Darrio (ph). 
Q 
A Darrio (ph). Okay. I gotcha. 
Darrio (ph), yes. That's the one I met in Atlanta. And then he was there. 
14 We talked --you know, basically, honestly, small talk, you know, family, how is 
15 everything, is everything good, stuff like that. And that was basically it until Stewart, 
16 Dave, and Bruce returned. That's when --oh, excuse me, go ahead. 
17 Q No, I was just going to ask. I think, you started to go into some detail here. 
18 What caused you to move from the west side of the Capitol, where we just watched that 
19 video, to the other side that you said? 
20 A Basically, just everything was just died down, and we just walked around to 
21 the other side, basically. What? Oh, the alerts on the text message. We got a 
22 tornado alert. First of all, we've got a tornado alert. I forgot about that. So it was 
23 now. The tornado alert. And then, about 30 minutes after the tornado alert, we got 
24 another alert that said: Off the streets of Washington by 6 o'clock curfew. 
25 That alert came through. And then, after that, that's when we stayed around  65 
1 maybe 10, 15 minutes, and then we walked around to the front. Sometime Stewart, 
2 David, and Darren got back, I guess, when Stewart's bag, that's when I mentioned --and I 
3 think Bruce did, too. He said: Guys, look, it's 5:35. We've got to get off these 
4 streets. 
5 And then we all dispersed and walked back. 
6 
7 
8 
9 Q You said it was David and David Kirk, and who else went back with --
A Darren. 
Q 
A Darren. David and Darren and Mr. Rhodes went back to find his bag? 
That's correct. And then, when they came back, that's when they brought 
10 Bob back. That's the first time I seen Bob since we left the stage. 
11 Q And did they say if they found Mr. Rhodes' bag? 
12 A I assume they did. I assume. I don't know if they did or not. He wasn't 
13 cussing anymore, put it that way. 
14 
15 
16 Q Rhodes came back with them? 
A Yes. 
Q About how long did it take them to go back to the stage and then return to 
17 where you were? 
18 A It wasn't that long. Enough where I know we were off the streets. We 
19 were off the streets of Washington, D.C. by I think 15 till 6, maybe 15 or 20 minutes till 6. 
20 So it had to be in that time range. 
21 Q I got you. Understood. All right, so then, after you guys realized you 
22 needed to, you know, basically vacate that area and get off the streets because of the 
23 curfew, where did you go? 
24 
25 A Back to that Phoenix. 
Q And why did you go back to the Phoenix Park Hotel?  1 A That's where --everybody walked to that area. There was no particular 
2 saying: Okay, we're going here because of this. 
3 We went back there, we were there approximately enough time to eat a 
4 sandwich, and then call Uber and back to our room. 
5 
6 Q 
A Who invited you to the Phoenix, or how did you know to go there? 
There was really no invitation. It was following the Oath Keepers, the 
7 group that I was telling you that was there. 66 
8 Q Yeah. When you were there, did you get a sense of like who got you in or 
9 who gave you access to this spread of sandwiches? 
10 A No, there was just other Oath Keepers there making sandwiches and then 
11 passing them out. I never seen Stewart again after that. 
12 
13 
14 
15 Q 
A 
Q 
A Was that in somebody's hotel room? 
It wasn't in the hotel room. This time it was lobby. 
And was it just Oath Keepers or other people? 
There was Oath Keepers there because the patches. There was other 
16 people there that didn't have patches on. 
17 
18 
19 Q 
A 
Q Do you know if they were affiliated with some other group? 
I have no idea, sir. 
Okay. Were they just kind of like regular folks, or was it people kind of in 
20 gear like you were? 
21 A It looked like they were in gear, but it looks like they had got back early 
22 enough to remove it. 
23 
24 Q 
A And then, after you guys ate the sandwiches, what did you do? 
Bob called Uber, and we Ubered --we waited out front, then we Ubered 
25 back to Virginia to a hotel room.  1 
2 
3 Q 
A 
Q And then what happened next? 
Went to bed, got up the next morning, and come back to South Carolina. 
All right. Let's talk a little bit about --I know at one point there was 
4 mention of a plan to go to a shooting range after the 6th. Is that right? 
That is correct. 67 
5 
6 A 
Q Okay. And, well, let me ask this question. When you brought the AR-15s 
7 to the Comfort Inn in the Northern Virginia area, why did you bring those weapons? 
8 A To go to the shooting range is why we brought those. Me and Dave were 
9 talking: Well, heck, if we get back, we'll do some targeting shooting. We never 
10 thought that this would happen the way it happened. 
11 Q And tell me what you can remember how you heard about the shooting 
12 range and who told you. 
13 A I can't remember. It was a chatter backdoor at a meeting that we could 
14 use a shooting range and do some target shooting. And that basically that was it on 
15 that. But it was never mentioned again.

Q And this was in one of the in-person meetings in South Carolina on Monday 
Yes, sir. 
And they mentioned --where was the range, do you remember? 
I don't know exactly. I just know it was North Carolina. 
Okay. And was it another Oath Keeper who was bringing you to the range? 
A 22 Yes, 
Q Like the Oath Keeper owned the range, or what was the Oath Keeper 
24 connection to that range? 
25 A It didn't say. It didn't say. But I know it wasn't just us from South  1 Carolina. It was lots of people that were supposed to be there. 
2 Q There is another kind of farm or area that Oath Keepers would sometimes 
3 frequent. There was a guy named Caldwell, Thomas Caldwell. Did you ever hear his 
4 name mentioned?

9 A No, sir. 
Q Okay.

Q Okay. So you departed for South Carolina the next morning, the morning 
10 of the 7th? 
11 
12 
13 A Yes. 
Q And then did you just drive straight back to South Carolina? 
A Straight back. We stopped, fueled up, and ate once fast food and went 
14 straight back. 
15 Q Okay. What was the feeling among your group after the 6th when you 
16 guys were driving back? Did you guys talk about the events of the 6th? 
17 
18 
19 
20 A Yeah, shock, stunned. Like, wow, this really happened like this? 
Q What was --
A Something like that. 
Q What were you --and I know it sounds like a silly yes --but what were you 
21 shocked about? 
22 
23 A That people did that to the Capitol. 
Q Did at that time on the trip back, were you aware that Oath Keepers had 
24 entered the Capitol? 
25 A No. None whatsoever. I didn't even know anybody entered the Capitol 68  69 
1 until we got to the hotel room. 
2 Q And you mean anybody at all? 
3 A Anybody at all. 
4 Q Okay. And when did you learn that Oath Keepers had entered the Capitol? 
5 A It was I think a couple of days after that with more news. 
6 Q I have a couple --if you don't mind, I am pretty much done with questions 
7 for you. But if you don't mind rewinding a little bit to the Atlanta rally. 
8 A Sure. 
9 Q I have a couple more questions about that. 
10 A Yes. 
11 Q You mentioned --so I know at some point, Mr. Rhodes directed you to a 
12 particular corner where you said there was pretty big police presence, or the police were 
13 already there, basically. 
14 
15 A 
Q That's correct. 
And tell me, when you interacted with the police, did you have a 
16 conversation with any of the police? 
17 
18 
19 A 
Q 
A Yes. 
Okay. And what did they tell you or ask you? 
Are you talking about the final or just a casual conversation? It was casual 
20 conversation too. 
21 
22 Q 
A Let's do both. What was the casual conversation about? 
Just, basically, weather stuff, you know, just: Hey, how you doing, you 
23 know, nice day, just stuff like this. The actually --I can't remember --I don't know if he 
24 was --he was a high ranking, I guess, police officer, he had, I think, stripes and asked us to 
25 come over. And that's when he asked me and Dave if we can help, you know, clear the  1 streets --
2 
3 
4 
5 right? Q And --
A --a police. 
Q And you said there was a pretty good number of police around that area, 70 
6 
7 A 
Q Yes, sir. Quite off. They even had armored trucks. I mean like tanks. 
Do you know why they asked you to help? Did it look like they didn't have 
8 enough people to help? 
9 A No, they had way more people to help. I don't know why that was even 
10 asked of us. 
11 Q Was this, in other experiences or in talking to other Oath Keepers, was this 
12 typical to coordinate with law enforcement like that? 
13 A I have no idea. Very first time ever being involved in anything like this. 
14 never been to a rally before in my life. So, basically, I was thinking maybe it was typical. 
15 Q All right. And then the other question was just I think you had told me, I 
16 know we have rehashed this question out, but later somebody told you that Roger Stone 
17 was there. Is that correct? 
18 A Yes, sir. 
19 Q Do you remember who told you that? 
20 A No, I do not. 
21 Q All right. Great. Then, if you give me just 2 minutes, and I'm going to look 
22 through my notes real quick, and I think we might be done here. 
23 
24 A Sure. 
Q One other question. I know you said you or somebody in your group was in 
25 touch with a North Carolina Oath Keeper named Paul who told you about the Comfort  1 Inn? 
2 
3 A Yes, sir. 
Q Did you ever hear mentions of North Carolina Oath Keepers named Dough 
4 Smith or Steve Kwiatkowski? 
5 
6 
7 A I never heard their names. 
Q All right.
