6 At this time, I'd ask the witness to please state your full name and spell your last 
7 name for the record. 
8 Mr. Robinson. My name is Mark Evans Robinson, and the last name is 
9 R-o-b-i-n-s-o-n. 
10 Thank you. This will be a staff-led interview, and members that 
11 are present, of course, can choose to ask questions as well. 
12 I'm I'm an investigative counsel for the committee. 
13 At this time, I'd ask for other members of the committee to announce themselves 
14 for the record. 
15 Hi, good morning. I'm I'm Senior 
16 Investigative Counsel with the committee. Thank you, Mr. Robinson. 
Good morning. I'm investigator. 
- senior counsel to the vice chair. 17 
18 
19 1. And, Mr. Robinson, I'm-. I'm the chief investigative 
20 counsel. Nice to meet you and thanks very much for being here. 
21 Mr. Robinson. Nice to meet you. 
22 In terms of members, we also have Mr. Adam Schiff and 
23 Ms. Stephanie Murphy that are present. 
24 Oh , sorry, I didn't see you on. If you want to announce yourself for 
25 the record as well.  4 
1 Yes. senior counsel. Thank you. 
2 At this time, could counsel for the Metropolitan Police 
3 Department please state their name for the record? 
4 Ms. Quon. Teresa Quon, Assistant General Counsel. 
5 Thank you, Ms. Quon. 
6 So, before we begin, Mr. Robinson, we'll go through a few ground rules with you, 
7 and I know you're aware of these from your career with MPD but just want to make sure 
8 you're tracking for this interview. 
9 This is an official interview, so it's being transcribed. We have a stenographer 
10 that's recording this interview, and she's joining us by Webex. 
11 When I ask each question, can you please just wait until we finish the question 
12 before you start your response. That way it's clear for the record. Also, if you do 
13 nonverbal responses, I'll indicate that for the record, but we'll also ask that you please 
14 make every answer verbal for us so that it's clear what your answer is. 
15 We ask that you provide complete answers just based on your best recollection. 
16 If you don't remember something, it's okay to say that you don't remember it, but to the 
17 best of your recollection, we'll ask that you please answer each question. 
18 Please let us know if you need any breaks or would like to discuss anything with 
19 Ms. Quon after any of our questions, and we'll go on a break. We'll mute, turn our 
20 cameras off. That way you can meet with her. 
21 Also, I have to remind you that you have to tell the truth. This is a congressional 
22 investigation, so you have to tell the truth to the best of your ability. It is illegal to 
23 provide false answers to Congress. 
24 And, also, again, if you have any questions, need any breaks, just let us know. 
25 Do you have any questions for us before we get started?  1

Mr. Robinson. No. 
Thank you. 
BY 
Q So, Mr. Robinson, please just give us a little bit about your background, your 
5 educational background, how you became --started working at the Metropolitan Police 
6 Department. 
7 A Well, I'm a high school graduate and also a United States Military vet. And I 
8 joined the Metropolitan Police Department in 1990, and I retired May 21, 2022. And so 
9 I spent 32 years with the Metropolitan Police Department and 3 years with the Fairfax 
10 County Police Department. 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 Q What branch of the service were you in? 
A Army. 
Q Were you an MP in the Army? 
A No. 
Q What various roles did you have within the Metropolitan Police 
16 Department? 
17 A I started out at the Fifth District. That's in 1990 to 1992. I spent 
18 the --probably about 12 years or so with the SOD, Special Operations Division. In 1999, 
19 I went to the Training Academy. At the Training Academy, I was an instructor there until 
20 2004. And, in 2004, I got promoted to a sergeant, went to the First District Substation, 
21 spent a few years there. 
22 Then I was recruited to come back to SOD to work with the Automated Traffic 
23 Enforcement Unit. I was there until it was civilianized. And then, in 2011, I returned 
24 back to SOD, where I stayed there until I retired. 
25 Q And, just for the record, Mr. Aguilar has joined.  1 So SOD, so that's Special Operations Division. Is that where the 
2 Presidential Motorcade Unit falls within MPD? 
3 
4 A 
Q Yes. 
Okay. So how long were you assigned to the Presidential motorcade in 
5 total? I think you might have said it, but just to make sure. 
6 A Yes. I was initially in SOD traffic in 1992 to 1999. And then I returned in 
7 2011 to Special Operations Division. So, from 2011 to May 21, 2022, was my duration 
8 with SOD. 
9 
10 Q 
A And what were your responsibilities within SOD? 
Conduct roll call, check calls. And we provided the assignments for the 
11 members assigned, handling demonstrations, handling the POTUS --the POTUS escorts, 
12 the Vice President escorts. 6 
13 All foreign dignitaries that responded to the area, we provided escorts for them as 
14 well, the motorcades, and dealt with any civil uprisings within the city, large-scale 
15 demonstrations, marches, parades, et cetera. 
16 Q So, with the POTUS movement, just walk us through how that would 
17 normally occur. How would you receive word? How would you prepare? Just walk 
18 us through that process with the POTUS movements in particular. 
19 A So, a lot of times, Secret Service would contact the Metropolitan Police 
20 Department and Special Operations Division via email. And they also had --personal 
21 contact was Lieutenant Margiotta. So we would receive information either through a 
22 vmail --an email, I'm sorry. And it would come as a daily assignment. 
23 We also have a Planning Division that would get the assignments as well. So the 
24 roll call sergeants would get the assignments and assign members to the motorcade itself. 
25 And so, the way it worked, we would have a lead vehicle, a tail vehicle, and  7 
1 Metropolitan Police would provide three motors. And then you have U.S. Park provide 
2 their three motors, and Secret Service provided three motors as well. And so that's for 
3 the POTUS and the VP. 
4 And so, if you had a medium, they would get motors as well --medium dignitary in 
5 the area, meaning their security level. And, if you had a high, of course, they would get 
6 the same treatment as a POTUS. 
7 Q So you said earlier, I think you mentioned roll call earlier, and so that's the 
8 individual that assigns the MPD officers for the POTUS movements that day? 
9 
10 
11 
12 A 
Q 
A 
Q Yes. It would be the roll call sergeant. 
And that's the role you were in I'm assuming in 2021, 2022? 
Yes. 
So, on January 6 --I'm jumping ahead, but we'll get there later. You would 
13 have assigned the MPD officers for the POTUS movements on January 6th of 2021? 
14 A So, because that was a major movement, the --it came from the 
15 commander. It was a collaboration. So the assignments came from the Commander of 
16 Special Operations. That would be Robert Glover, who's now retired. And it would 
17 also be Lieutenant Margiotta, who would have got the details. 
18 And so oftentimes I would be assigned to the POTUS because of my seniority and 
19 because I was an official. And so Lieutenant Margiotta would like --always wanted an 
20 official to be on the POTUS motorcade as the lead vehicle. 
21 
22 Q I'd also like to note for the record that Ms. Zoe Lofgren has joined. 
So I know within the SOD who was assigned the POTUS movements. Were there 
23 any other units within MPD that would assist with the POTUS movements other than 
24 SOD? 
25 A They would call in other additional units from patrol, you know, to handle  1 traffic posts if we were --didn't have sufficient manpower for it. 
2 Q 
3 correct? 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q And you said that the actual request would come in via email. Is that 
Yes. 
Who would that request come in to? 
Lieutenant Margiotta. 
Can you spell that last name for us, please. 
I believe it's M-a-r-g-i-o-t-t-a. 
And when you were coordinating these movements for POTUS, did you all 
10 communicate on the standard MPD radio or was there a special frequency or radio that 
11 you used for these movements? 
12 A I'm sorry. We would often use special events channel, and sometimes we 
13 would have three frequencies, MPD 1, MPD 2, MPD 3. 
14 Q And what would be communicated on this radio typically for a POTUS 
15 movement? 
16 A We would announce whether or not the POTUS is moving, if he's moving to 
17 cars. We will announce traffic closures, and we will announce whether or not we have 
18 arrived and POTUS is at the location. 
19 If he's about to return, we will announce that as well, preparing. And if we had 
20 to make traffic closures at that time, we would make traffic closures. And then we 
21 would --we will announce the return. 
22 Q Were you all at MPD responsible for the route, or would that come from 
23 Secret Service? 
24 A No, it was a collaborative joint, you know, information. So it would --the 
25 route would be established between Lieutenant Margiotta and Secret Service. They 8  1 would have meetings, and they would come up with --they would develop the route 
2 itself. If it's a problem, then the lead vehicle would also discuss that route, if there's 
3 some unforeseen problems, with the TS agent or the lead agent with Secret Service. 
4 Q And who was the point of contact, if you know, from Secret Service that 
5 would be doing this collaboration with you all? 
6 A It would either be the --whoever's assigned --and it's rotating --whoever's 
7 assigned as the TS agent, transportation agent, or the lead agent for Secret Service. 
8 
9 
10 Q 
A 
Q Typically, how much notice were you given for POTUS movements? 
Twenty-four hours. 
Were there ever times where you had to make a movement, I'm sure there 
11 were, but less than 24 hours' notice? 
12 
13 A 
Q Yes. 
Can you just describe some of those times? I assumed it, but can you just 
14 describe some of those? 9 
15 A I mean, sometimes, I mean, we received notices as late as a half an hour, you 
16 know. 
17 
18 Q 
A Okay. 
And that's when they would communicate to Lieutenant Margiotta that we 
19 have a POTUS movement. And oftentimes, we would have to respond expeditiously 
20 to --to the White House. 
21 
22 
23 Mr.- Does anyone have any followup to those questions? 
B 
Q I have one. Mr. Robinson, let me ask you this: You mentioned that that 
24 was a major movement that day. Do you recall the reason why it was considered a 
25 major movement that day instead of just a regular movement to the Ellipse?  10 
1 A Because I know there was a speech involved, and I know that that meeting 
2 itself, I don't know if they were preparing for anything. I don't know that anybody 
3 expected what was going to happen on January 6th to happen, to occur. 
4 But I know we had a lot of protesters within the area itself, and I think it was high, 
5 a high movement, and we did have personnel, CDU units and all of that in the area. 
6 Q Do you know if there was any discussion of any routes or anything in regards 
7 to back and forth to the Ellipse that day on any of the frequencies, any trouble or 
8 anything mentioned on the frequencies during that day moving back and forth to the 
9 Ellipse? 
10 A Yes. I believe we was on special events channel, and I was monitoring the 
11 traffic. And so I could hear some of the units pointing out to individuals that there were 
12 individuals along Constitution Avenue that were armed, that were up in the trees, and I 
13 can hear the units responding to those individuals. And so there's always a concern 
14 when there's a POTUS in the area. 
15 Thank you. 
16 
17 Q Mr. Robinson, I just wanted to, before we get into the details of January 6th 
18 itself, just zoom out a little bit. 
19 In the days preceding, were you also working any of the movements with the 
20 Presidential motorcade, January 3rd, 4th, 5th? 
21 
22 A 
Q Yes. 
Were there any conversations you had or rumors indicating that the 
23 President may want to go to the Capitol on January 6th in the days before? 
24 A Well, not the days before. But on January 6th, while at the Ellipse, the TS 
25 agent did advise that the President wanted to go to the Capitol from the Ellipse. And so  11 
1 that information was being discussed. 
2 I think while he was speaking and then shortly after he had finished speaking, that 
3 was being discussed and which the TS agent relayed to myself that the President wanted 
4 to go to the Ellipse. 
5 
6 
7 
8 Q 
A 
Q 
A Before we get into that in a little bit more detail, who was that TS agent? 
I do not recall. 
Okay. And where was he receiving that information from? 
From his communication. You know, they have their own radio channels, 
9 and they monitor it themselves. And so I guess he's hearing the transmissions and 
10 relaying that information to me. 
11 Mrs. Murphy. I'm sorry. Mark said he wanted to go to the Ellipse. Could you 
12 ask that question and answer it again so that it accurately reflects that the President 
13 wanted to go to the Capitol, unless that's not what you meant? But what you said was 
14 Ellipse. 
15 BY 
16 Q Sure. Mr. Robinson, can you just --I think you started with what a TS agent 
17 told you. Can you just go through that again. And then we're going to start with more 
18 detail with January 6th itself, but to Ms. Murphy's question. 
19 A Yes. While on the scene at the Ellipse and the TS agent was receiving 
20 communication from his --through his channels, and he had mentioned to me that the 
21 President wanted to respond to the Capitol from the Ellipse. 
22 
23 
24 
25 Does that clarify it? 
Mrs. Murphy. Thank you. 
Q And I believe you said that was during the speech, correct, Mr. Robinson?  1 
2 A 
Q Yes. 
So let's just start from the beginning, though. When you --did you start 
3 your day out at the White House picking up the President and then to the Ellipse? 
4 
5 A 
Q Yes. 
Again, did you hear any conversations about what was the atmosphere in 
6 terms of just making that movement from the White House to the Ellipse? Was 
7 anything concerning or unusual? 12 
8 A Well, not from the White House to the Ellipse, because pretty much it's still 
9 on the White House Grounds so it's pretty much a secure Complex. 
10 However, there was a lot of demonstrators in the area, and that was cause for 
11 concern. And, like I said, again, for MPD, I could hear the radio transmissions with 
12 individuals in the area that were armed. 
13 Q And, on that radio channel, so the special events channel, is that only MPD, 
14 or is there the Service and Park Police on there? 
15 A I believe Park Police and Service do have the capability of monitoring those 
16 channels, those frequencies. 
17 Q Monitoring, but do you hear any of the Secret Service monitoring that comes 
18 over that channel? I'm just wondering if your sources over the radio is solely MPD or if 
19 it overlaps with other law enforcement. 
20 A Predominantly, it is MPD, but we do share those frequencies. And so there 
21 are times when you would hear Capitol --I've only heard Capitol and Park Police over the 
22 channel, come over the air itself. But on that particular day, predominantly it was MPD. 
23 Q Got it. Did you hear any of the Secret Service radio frequencies during any 
24 of that time on January 6th? 
25 A I could hear only the movements because they have multiple channels. But  13 
1 there is a channel that --there's a radio that Secret Service provide in the lead car and in 
2 the tail car. And so we can hear when the President's moving to the vehicles, and we 
3 can hear when he's preparing to leave, depart. And so that's when we're able to call 
4 traffic closures. 
5 
6 Q 
A Got it. 
Yes. But I can't --they have multiple channels that they communicate on, 
7 though, Secret Service. 
8 Q So, when you're hearing the movements in the lead vehicle that you're in, 
9 who is relaying that information from the Secret Service? 
10 A Probably one of their supervisors and then --yeah, it's one of the supervisors 
11 in one of the cars. 
12 Q Okay. But --and if you don't know, that's fine. I'm just wondering if it's 
13 the person who's actually in the President's vehicle or in another one of the vehicles of 
14 the motorcade that's relaying the information. 
15 A Oftentimes, it's the TS agent and I believe the lead agent communicating on 
16 their channel. 
17 Q So --and the lead agent, are you familiar with who the lead agent was for 
18 the Presidential detail that day? 
19 
20 A 
Q No. 
Do you work with the same Secret Service folks when you are involved with 
21 the motorcade? 
22 
23 A 
Q No. They rotate. 
Okay. But does the lead detail for the President himself, Robert Engel, are 
24 you familiar with him? 
25 A No.  14 
1 Q Okay. So you get to the Ellipse. Can you just talk us through what 
2 happens once you get there? 
3 A So the motorcade parks, and we're on standby until the President is finished 
4 and ready to go. And so we arrive safely. We park and stop. 
5 The President did exit his vehicle and went into a secure tent prior to the speech. 
6 I know he did the speech and then returned back to the tent and returned back to the 
7 limos. 
8 Q What was the plan, as it was conveyed to you all, about what was going to 
9 happen at the Ellipse and the movement after? 
10 A So, while on the Ellipse, we know that there were discussions about the 
11 President leaving the Ellipse and responding to the Capitol. And so we were quite 
12 concerned that he wanted to make that movement because I was hearing, like I said, the 
13 traffic on the radio with the large-scale demonstration. And I didn't have a clear picture 
14 as to what was happening at the Capitol, but there was concern on Secret Service part 
15 and as well as MPD. 
16 Q And what did you hear specifically? 
17 A I could hear --I could hear I believe at that time Commander Glover sending 
18 CDU troops to the Capitol, responding. And they were saying that there were 
19 demonstrators there attempting to breach the Capitol. 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q What time were you hearing that information? 
I believe that, if I'm correct, probably about 1:30, 2 o'clock. 
Was it after the speech? 
Yes. 
Okay. So let's just establish some timeframes here. The President's 
25 speech began at noon and ended around 1:09, 1:10.  1 
2 A Yes. 
Q So, knowing that that was the start of the speech, what time do you think 
3 you got to the Ellipse as part of the motorcade? 
4 A So I believe we arrived maybe a little --a little after 11, maybe 11:50, 40 or 
5 so. I don't recall the time exactly. 
Q Okay. And what type of vehicle are you in that day? 
A I believe it was a Dodge SUV. 15 
6 
7 
8 
9 Q And you were the lead car, and was the President's car the one behind you? 
A You have --it's the lead car, and it's the vehicle called corner back, which is 
10 their communications. Then you have the President's limo, and then you have a spare 
11 limo. 
12 
13 Q So there's four cars in total? 
A Well, it's more than that, but those are the cars that I recall that's behind the 
14 lead vehicle. 
15 Q Got it. So, when you get to the Ellipse and you park, do you stay in your 
16 vehicle, or do you go into the tent at all? 
17 
18 A No, I stay in my vehicle. 
Q And, in the vehicle, you have the MPD communications as well as the special 
19 event radio as well? 
20 A We have the special events. That is the MPD communication, but you also 
21 have a radio that's provided by Secret Service. 
22 Q Got it. So, just to go back to when you said the --when the TS agent told 
23 you that the President wanted to go to the Capitol, that was while the President was 
24 speaking. Is that right? 
25 A That was during the speech and after the speech.  1 Q What --let's just take it from the first part, during the speech. What was 
2 discussed when the TS agent conveyed that to your folks at the MPD? 
3 A He just mentioned that the President --there's a possibility that the 
4 President is going to go to the Capitol. 
5 
6 Q 
A And was there any action taken that you know of? 
No, because it wasn't confirmed at that time. It was just the possibility. 
7 And so my responsibility is just to inform my units, which was mainly the tail car and my 
8 three motors. 
9 Q And do you know if the TS agent was reacting to what the President said in 16 
10 his speech, or were there independent conversations that triggered him to tell you that? 
11 
12 
13 
14 A 
Q 
A 
Q I believe it was communications over his radio. 
Which would be the Secret Service radio? 
Yes. 
Which is the radio that you don't have --you didn't have that 
15 communication, access to that communication. Just trying to establish what you hear 
16 over the radio versus what you hear directly. Sorry it's confusing. 
17 A No, it's okay. No, like I said, they have multiple channels that they 
18 communicate on. And so the radio in the car I can just hear when probably the lead 
19 agent is announcing that the President is moving. You also have supervisors that are 
20 directly with the President. So they are communicating to the lead and TS agent that 
21 the President is moving so we can prepare for departure or arrival. 
22 And so in the other communications that I'm not privy to that they're talking 
23 about the movement from the Ellipse to the Capitol. 
24 Q Got it. So when --do you know if a route was established at any point 
25 while the President was speaking to provide him a path to get to the Capitol?  17 
1 A No. Fortunately, there was no route discussed, because it had not been 
2 confirmed that we were going to actually make the movement. 
3 Q So there wasn't --do you know if there was any discussion of any route at all 
4 in terms of just like as a preliminary plan, even though it hadn't been established that he 
5 would be going? 
6 A No, because, like I said, while we were still at the Ellipse, we didn't know 
7 what was happening outside of the Complex. And so, in order to even attempt to 
8 develop a route, I would have had to communicate with probably Lieutenant Margiotta to 
9 come up with a route from the Ellipse to the Capitol. And that would have had to be 
10 based on what was happening outside of the Complex. 
11 Q Got it. So, at the end of the speech, what was the plan supposed to be? 
12 A So, at the end of the speech, we do know that while inside the limo, the 
13 President was still adamant about going to the Capitol. That's being relayed to me by 
14 the TS agent. 
15 And so we did depart the Ellipse and we responded back to the White House. 
16 However, we --the motorcade, the POTUS motorcade was placed on standby. And so 
17 we were told to stand by on West Exec until they confirm whether or not the President 
18 was going to go to the Capitol. 
19 And so I believe we may have waited I would just estimate maybe 45 to --45 
20 minutes to an hour waiting for Secret Service to make that decision. 
21 Q 
22 vehicle --
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A Got it. Let me just pause there. Did you say the President entered the 
No, I did not. 
--at the Ellipse? 
No, I did not.  18 
1 Q Okay. So how --just walk us through in as much detail as you can. When 
2 the President leaves the tent and enters his vehicle, how do you learn that he was 
3 adamant about still wanting to go to the Capitol? 
4 A That is --the information is being relayed to me by the TS agent who's in the 
5 car with me. And so our communication was he's telling me that the President wants to 
6 go to the Capitol. He's upset, and he wants to go. That's the information that's being 
7 relayed to me. 
8 
9 Q 
A And was there any description of what was occurring in the car? 
No. Only that --the only description I received was that the President was 
10 upset and that he was adamant about going to the Capitol, and there was a heated 
11 discussion about that. 
12 Q When you say "heated," is that your word, or is that the word that was 
13 described by the TS agent? 
14 A No. The word described by the TS agent meaning that the President was 
15 upset, and he was saying there was a heated argument or discussion about going to the 
16 Capitol. And so that's [inaudible] to stand by. 
17 Q 
18 it? 
19 A 
20 motorcade. 
21 
22 Q 
A I'm sorry, it faded out a little bit. And that was what? Could you repeat 
I'm sorry. That was why we were told to stand by the Presidential 
So when are you told this exactly? Is it before you leave the Ellipse? 
It's prior to departure, leaving the Ellipse, en route to the Capitol --I'm sorry, 
23 en route to the White House. It's a short trip from the Ellipse. It's still on the White 
24 House Grounds. 
25 And so, when we arrived at West Exec, the TS agent just told us to stand by  19 
1 because they had not made a decision whether or not we were going to transport the 
2 President to the Capitol.  1 
2 
3 Q BY 
Got it. But let me just back up. Before you get to West Exec, you're still 
4 at the Ellipse. When was the information relayed to you about the heated argument, 
5 before your vehicle starts moving or while you are still waiting at the Ellipse after the 
6 President got into the vehicle? 20 
7 A Well, it was prior to --we're waiting. So the information is being relayed to 
8 me that the President is having this discussion about going to the Capitol. And then, 
9 while we are departing, the information is being relayed to me that we --the President 
10 still wanted to go to the Capitol. And so, once we arrive at West Exec, we're then told to 
11 stand by because --
12 Q Got it. Before you get to West Exec, one second. Before you leave the 
13 Ellipse area, do you remember, once the President got into his vehicle, did you all 
14 immediately start moving towards the White House, or was there some delay? Do you 
15 have any memory on that? 
16 A Myself, I'm a few vehicles ahead. So, once we know he was loaded, then I 
17 check with the TS agent and see whether or not we're ready to depart. And he 
18 acknowledged we were. And so we do what we called a slow roll. So I started just 
19 moving towards West Exec. 
20 Q I see.  1 
2 
3 Q 21 
BY 
I guess the followup is, when you're doing that slow roll, approximately how 
4 long was it before the slow roll before you started actually moving? 
5 
6 A It was within seconds. 
Q Within seconds. Did you receive the information about, in your words, the 
7 heated discussion while you were doing that slow roll or before you even started the slow 
8 roll? 
9 
10 
11 
12 A Before we started the slow roll and while we're actually moving. 
Q Got it. Thank you. 
BY 
Q Mr. Robinson, how long do you think it took you to depart from that Ellipse 
13 there where the drop-off and pickup point to the South Grounds there? 
14 A From the Ellipse to West Exec, probably --probably --I mean, it's not that 
15 far. [Inaudible.] no longer, no longer for that movement. 
16 
17 
18 Q So that would encompass, that slow roll, you'd probably say 2 to 3 minutes? 
A I probably would say 2 minutes. 
Q Okay. And all of that conversation that we're talking about happened 
19 during that timeframe? 
20 
21 A 
Q During that timeframe and also while we're waiting at West Exec. 
Now, let me ask you this: Is that normal that you would sometimes wait 
22 30, 45 minutes before --you know, if something was taking place, is that normal that you 
23 guys would wait there, or is that something that is not normally done? 
24 A No, that's --I wouldn't say that's nor --that's not normal. If there's a 
25 secondary movement, then we are advised of that. And there are times when we may  22 
1 wait maybe 10 or 15 minutes, maybe 20 at the max for Secret Service to make a decision 
2 whether or not there's going to be another movement so we can prepare for that. 
3 
4 
5 Q 
Q Thank you. 
BY 
Once you got to West Exec, Mr. Robinson, who were you communicating 
6 with in terms of telling you to stand by for that period of time until a decision was made? 
7 
8 
9 
10 A 
Q 
Q I was communicating with the TS agent that's inside my car. 
Got it. 
BY 
Going back --I think you mentioned it, but I just want to make sure it's clear 
11 for the record. What kind of vehicle was President Trump in on January 6th? 
12 A He was in the Presidential limo. I don't know if it was a truck or the 
13 Cadillac-style vehicle. 
14 
15 
16 
17 Q 
A 
Q Okay. So you don't recall which one out of those two? 
I do not. 
BY 
Mr. Robinson, you mentioned the limo. Is the truck vehicle, is that 
18 normally called a Suburban? Are you familiar with that term? 
19 A Yes. 
20 Q So that truck vehicle that you mentioned would be the Suburban, and then 
21 there's a limo that they call the Beast? 
22 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A Yes, that's correct. 
Okay. Thank you. 
You're welcome. 
Mr. Schiff.  23 
1 Mr. Schiff. Yes, thank you. Just a couple of quick questions. 
2 The heated discussion or argument that you mentioned, sir, do you recall anything 
3 else that was said about the nature of that argument? 
4 Mr. Robinson. No, other than the President was upset and that the President 
5 was adamant about going to the Capitol. And so that's why we were placed on standby. 
6 Mr. Schiff. And were you able to hear a discussion of why either the Secret 
7 Service or others were urging him not to go to the Capitol? 
8 Mr. Robinson. I couldn't hear that communication. I believe that's happening 
9 on another channel, Secret Service, that I'm not privy to. 
10 But the information I'm relying on is being communicated directly by the TS agent. 
11 And so he gave me the impression that he was alarmed, and I can sense that there was 
12 some concern about that response. 
13 Mr. Schiff. How often have you been part of the President's motorcade? 
14 Mr. Robinson. I --when I came back to SOD in 2011, I essentially took over after 
15 I Sergeant Earps (ph) had retired, Sergeant Steve Earps (ph). So I started doing the 
16 Presidential motorcade since 2011 up until I retired 2022. 
17 Mr. Schiff. So about how many times would you say you've been part of that 
18 motorcade with the President? 
19 
20 Mr. Robinson. Probably over a hundred times. 
Mr. Schiff. And, in that hundred times, have you ever witnessed another 
21 discussion of an argument or a heated discussion with the President where the President 
22 was contradicting where he was supposed to go or what the Secret Service believed was 
23 safe? 
24 
25 Mr. Robinson. No. 
Mr. Schiff. Thank you, sir.  Mr. Robinson. Yes. 
Mr. Schiff. Appreciate your service. 
Mr. Robinson. Thank you.

4 
5 Q What happened once you got to the West Exec and then you were there you 
6 said 45 minutes? Is it the same TS agent tells you then that there's going to be no 
7 movement for the rest of the day? 
8 A Yes. So, while waiting at West Exec, the agent did come back out and 
9 advise us that the President is not going --not going to the Capitol. However, the 
10 POTUS team remained in the area and we remained in the area until we heard 
11 Commander Glover give the 1033 signal to respond to the Capitol. 
12 Q Got it. And then what did you do at that point? 
13 A So, once we heard Commander Glover give the 1033 response over the 
14 radio, my team, I informed my team to respond to the Capitol. And we left the White 
15 House area from downtown, probably Pennsylvania Avenue, and responded to the 
16 Capitol. 
17 BY 
18 
19 
20 Q 
A 
Q What time was this, approximately? 
I would say approximately 3 o'clock. 
So you were at the White House until about 3 o'clock until you received the 
21 call from Commander Glover, and then you reported to the Capitol Building? 
22 A We had left the White House Grounds, but we were still in close, close 
23 proximity. I believe we was at 20th and Pennsylvania Avenue and staged because 
24 Lieutenant Margiotta wanted us to be staged in the area because our primary 
25 responsibility for that day was POTUS.  1 
2 Q B~ 
At any time on the 6th, even before you got to the Ellipse, did you hear 
3 about any specifics regarding the crowd, in terms of size, in terms of items they were 
4 carrying, what was being seized at magnetometers? Did any of that come into your 
5 knowledge in terms of over the radio or through just talking to others? 
6 A Well, while at the Ellipse, I can see that there was a large crowd on the 
7 Ellipse. I can also see prior to responding to the White House that there was a large 
8 crowd already on --a large presence already on Constitution Avenue. 
9 And so I can hear on the MPD radio that there were individuals --and this is 
10 probably during the movement and during the Ellipse while the President was speaking, 25 
11 that individuals was in the area and did have weapons. And I believe there was --MPD 
12 did make contact with individuals in the crowd that did actually have weapons. 
13 And we were receiving information from --complaints that there were cars in the 
14 area, and I remember specifically L'Enfant Plaza, vehicles --weapons were seen in a 
15 vehicle, so units did respond to that. So I can just hear those type of responses on the 
16 radio. 
17 
18 
19 Q 
A 
Q On the MPD radio? 
On the MPD radio. 
Okay. Then, just to get back to the President's movement, in the time that 
20 you were waiting or in any time afterwards, did you learn about what was going on within 
21 the White House? Were there any updates as far as why you all were sitting there and 
22 waiting? 
23 A So the only update I received was the fact --was whether or not they were 
24 going to confirm that we weren't actually going to motorcade to the Capitol. So that 
25 was what I was waiting for.  1 Q So it's fair to say, when the President was dropped off at the White House 
2 until you then ultimately left, it was still an open question whether he was going or not 
3 until it was confirmed by that TSA agent? 
4 
5 A 
Q Yes. 
And was that the same TSA agent that you were in touch with that was 
6 communicating to you from the time the President was giving his speech and 
7 until --throughout that time period? 
Yes. 26 
8 
9 A 
Q In any --while you were sitting there, again, before you left the Ellipse, when 
10 it was conveyed that the President adamantly wanted to go, was there --and I think Mr. 
11 Schiff asked this but just to drill down --was there a response given as to why he could 
12 not go? 
13 A There was no response given to me, per se, other than --and so I'm just 
14 waiting for the Secret Service to confirm whether or not we're actually going to respond 
15 to the Capitol or if the move is going to be canceled. That's what I'm waiting for. 
16 Q Did you learn later that day or in the days following why the President was 
17 not allowed to or permitted to go to the Capitol? 
18 
19 A 
Q I did not. 
Did you have your own sense, in your own law enforcement experience, 
20 whether that would have been a good idea for the President to go to the Capitol that 
21 day? 
22 A In my sense, it would have been a horrible --a horrible decision to respond 
23 to the Capitol. 
24 Q Why is that? 
25 A Because, even after receiving a 1033, it was difficult for myself, my team, the  1 POTUS team, which is my vehicle, the tail car and the three vehicles, to respond to the 
2 Capitol. All of the routes that we would normally use were at a heavy capacity with 
3 pedestrians. 
4 And, when I arrived at 3rd and Constitution, it was being blocked by a large 
5 number of demonstrators. They wasn't --they were not allowing vehicles to come in 
6 the area. They even blocked myself. I had to take an alternate route, which was 
7 Louisiana Avenue. And I came in through the Capitol's secured barricade, and that's 
8 how I was able to make it to the Capitol. And then --
9 
10 
11 Q 
A 
Q Sure. 
I'm sorry. 
But, just to be clear, though, that's still around like 3 o'clock after the 1033 
12 was announced, right? 
Yes. 27 
13 
14 A 
Q But prior to, around the 1:10 time period, when the President wanted to go 
15 to the Capitol, would that have been possible? Obviously, the time period is a little bit 
16 different an hour and a half later. 
17 
18 
19 A 
Q 
A Right. 
Just in your judgment. 
One, we would have --we didn't have --we didn't have plans to do it. Two, 
20 we didn't have resources in place. Because oftentimes when the President leaves the 
21 compound, the White House, it's a secured route, which means that we would have 
22 personnel along the route for traffic closures. 
23 And so none of that was in place. And so that, again, would not have been good 
24 for the motorcade to move because we didn't have resources in place for that movement. 
25 Q Were you involved with off-the-record movements with the President  28 
1 preceding this at any time? 
2 A Yes. 
3 Q And those could occur, as I think you said earlier, in a time of like 30 minutes' 
4 notice. Is that right? 
5 A Thirty minutes' notice is still mostly --Lieutenant Margiotta, the way he ran 
6 the unit, even when we have those 30-minute timeframe to respond and do a movement, 
7 he would still provide as many units as he can to cover critical traffic points. 
8 Q So, just so --in the off-the-record movements that you were involved in 
9 before, it's possible to have such a thing happen in less --with less notice. Is that fair? 
10 
11 A 
Q Yes, yes. 
Okay. Were you part of the November or December off-the-record 
12 movements when there was a MAGA rally November 12th and December --I'm sorry, 
13 November 14th and December 12th, when the President's motorcade drove by? Sorry, 
14 that was in November. 
15 A Yes. I was --I do remember being assigned to the motorcade, and I do 
16 remember Commander Glover telling us not to be involved with that OTR movement. 
17 
18 Q 
A Why is that? 
Because this was something that was unusual. The Presidential motorcade 
19 first came out I think the barricade at 15th and E Street, which is not normal. And the 
20 Presidential motorcade drove through that MAGA crowd. And that's why Commander 
21 Glover did not want MPD assets to get involved. 
22 Q So, just so I'm clear, so that November rally when the President drove by in 
23 the motorcade, MPD was not involved in that? 
24 
25 A That is correct. 
B~  29 
1 Q Was it because he was driving into a crowd that you normally try to avoid, is 
2 that why you all didn't want to be involved? 
3 
4 
5 A 
Q That is correct. 
BY 
So let's [inaudible] this a little bit more. For a time that --for the 
6 coordination that goes on with Secret Service and MPD for a movement of the President, 
7 there can be a movement that MPD is not aware of. Is that fair? 
A 
Q Yes. 
Give us one second. Thank you, Mr. Robinson. 8 
9 
10 
11 
12 [Discussion off the record.] 
BY 
Q Mr. Robinson, just a couple more questions. To take you back to waiting, 
13 to the Ellipse when you're in the car and you get --the TS agent conveyed the President 
14 adamantly wanting to go to the Capitol. Was that in person or did that come over the 
15 radio? 
16 A No, that was in person to me that he's communicating that the President 
17 wants to go to the Capitol. 
18 
19 
20 Q 
A 
Q 
21 Is that right? 
22 
23 
24 know? 
25 A 
Q 
A And that TS agent is in your vehicle? 
Yes, ma'am. 
And that he's getting that radio communication over his Secret Service radio. 
Yes, ma'am. 
And was it over the radio, or was there like cell phones being used, do you 
No. They do wear an earpiece, and so I guess he can hear certain  30 
1 transmissions that I can't hear because they communicate I believe over two radio zones. 
2 
3 
4 Q 
A 
Q 
5 Robinson? 
6 
7 
8 
9 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
10 his tone? 
11 A Got it. And that --that TS agent, can you describe what he looks like? 
I don't recall from that day. 
You don't --were you in the vehicle with him for a few hours, though, Mr. 
I was. I was. But --
Okay. White guy, Black guy, Hispanic? 
Probably he was a White male, slender built. 
Okay. And when he conveyed this information to you, was he --what was 
He was alarmed. He was concerned. And he appeared to be upset to me, 
12 because no one wanted to make that move. 
13 Q And, again, we're just going to go back to what was conveyed to you. In 
14 terms of as much detail as you can give, what makes you think --what makes you say he 
15 sounded alarmed? 
16 A Because he was like --he was saying that the President wanted to go to the 
17 Capitol. And he kept saying that he was in the limo arguing, you know, with [inaudible]. 
18 That's what he's communicating to me. 
19 And so we're preparing, you know --I don't think I reached out to Lieutenant 
20 Margiotta, because it was not confirmed that we're going to make that movement, but I 
21 can read the body tone from the TS agent that it was heated. It was something that 
22 neither agency wanted to do, and we were waiting for that decision to be made. 
23 Q When you say they were arguing, was it your sense that there was a 
24 back-and-forth between the President and the agents in the vehicle? 
25 A Yes.  31 
And why do you say that? 1 
2 Q 
A Because that's what's being relayed to me, that the President is in the limo. 
3 And this is verbal by the TS agent, not over the radio. He's telling me that the President 
4 is in the limo. He's upset, that the President wants to go to the Capitol. And so --and 
5 this is while we're waiting at the Ellipse shortly prior to our departure. 
6 Once we arrived at West Exec, it's still being communicated that the President is 
7 upset and there is a heated discussion in the limo. And we're waiting for the agents, 
8 Secret Service to make that decision of whether or not we're going to respond to the 
9 Capitol. 
10 BY 
11 Q And, just to clarify just so we can visualize how this is happening, the TS 
12 agent is receiving updates on his earpiece. Is that fair? 
13 
14 A 
Q 
15 earpiece? 
16 
17 A 
Q Yes, yes. 
And then narrating it to you in the car about what he's hearing over the 
Yes. 
So you're getting live updates from the TS agent as he's receiving updates in 
18 his ear, from what you remember? 
19 
20 
21 
22 A 
Q 
Q Yes. 
Okay. 
BY !IL 21 iii iii! LIS! ii 
And the earpiece communication is coming from the agents in the 
23 President's vehicle, correct? 
24 
25 A 
Q Correct. 
So the TS agent that you're with --now, just so again, to visualize it, are you  1 driving that vehicle? 
Yes. He's in my vehicle. Yeah, the TS agent is in my vehicle. 
So it's you and the TS agent. Is he in the passenger side? 
Yes. 
Are there other folks in the car? 32 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Sometimes the lead. I don't recall whether or not the lead agent was in my 
7 car. And sometimes for short movements like that, it's just the TS agent and myself. 
8 Q Okay. What was the followup? I mean, obviously, you're in the car with 
9 this guy. He's alarmed. It's something that neither agency, as you just said, wanted to 
10 do. How did it get resolved? 
11 A So we --when we respond back to West Exec, the President limo and --went 
12 into the compound, and I guess they went into the Oval Office. And so we're waiting on 
13 West Exec. And then, like I said, we were there maybe 45 minutes to an hour. Then 
14 they came back out, and the TS agent said: We're not making that movement. 
15 
16 Q BY 
Did the TS agent seem surprised that there was some type of argument 
17 going on in the President's vehicle? 
18 A No, he didn't seem surprised. It appeared to me that it was a concern. 
19 He had a concerned look on his face because, like I said, it's something that neither 
20 agency wanted to do or was prepared to do at that time. 
21 Q In the weeks or days after January 6th, I want to keep it like January 2021, do 
22 you recall anybody ever talking about this argument or this discussion with the President? 
23 Did anyone talk about it around the department, or any other POTUS movements? 
24 
25 A No. 
B  33 
1 Q Mr. Robinson, let me ask you a quick question. Concerning that 
2 movement, do you know if that TS agent was possibly on the cell phone receiving any 
3 communication or information during that time? 
4 A He did --he was talking on the phone, and he was communicating, you 
5 know, with the earpiece. And he exited the vehicle a lot of times, my vehicle, and talked 
6 to his superiors. 
7 
8 
9 Q 
Q Okay. Okay. Thank you. 
BY 
When you say "exited the vehicle," do you know if he went back to the 
10 President's vehicle? 
11 
12 A 
Q He went in that direction; I can tell you that. 
And when you say "superiors," would his superior be the lead --the lead 
13 Secret Service agent for the Presidential detail? 
14 A It would be his supervisors, and I know they have a few. So that's who he's 
15 communicating with. 
16 Q Just to go back to the words of "adamant" and "heated" and "argument," 
17 was there any sense that what happened in the vehicle went beyond just verbal 
18 back-and-forth? 
19 
20 
21 A 
Q I wouldn't know that. 
B~ 
So I know you were doing the roll call that day. Were there any other MPD 
22 officers who would have been receiving updates like this other than you? 
23 A No. 
24 Q Okay. So you would get the update, and then you would communicate that 
25 down the chain to your folks within MPD?  1 
2 A 
Q Yes. 
Okay. Do you know or would we be able to know who was assigned with 
3 you that day who would have been receiving your updates? 
4 A It would have been Officer Darren Edwards. And I recall that Officer 
5 Luckett --and forgive me, I can't remember his name. He's retired too. I don't 
6 remember the other two motors that were assigned that particular day. 
7 Q So we understand the process, the TSA agent receives an update, tells you, 34 
8 and then you're then communicating these updates to Officer Edwards, Luckett, and the 
9 other folks on your team? 
10 
11 
12 
13 A Yes. 
Anybody else have any questions? 
Mrs. Murphy. I do. Sorry. This is Rep. Murphy. 
I just wanted to go back. You said that your superior didn't want you to go to 
14 the --to go with the motorcade to the drive-by of that one protest in November. Is that 
15 right? 
16 
17 
18 right? 
19 
20 Mr. Robinson. The MAGA protest, yes. 
Mrs. Murphy. And so you didn't accompany the President to that. Is that 
Mr. Robinson. That is correct. 
Mrs. Murphy. And you didn't do that because your superiors didn't want you all 
21 driving into a crowd? 
22 
23 Mr. Robinson. That is correct. 
Mrs. Murphy. And so, on January 6th, when there was talk about going down to 
24 the Capitol and you know there are crowds that way, did you --when you first started to 
25 hear that they wanted you to drive that way, did you have to talk to a superior about  1 that? 
2 
3 
4 Mr. Robinson. Are you referring to the Presidential motorcade -­
Mrs. Murphy. Yes. 
Mr. Robinson. I would have had to communicate with Lieutenant Margiotta, 35 
5 because we would have had to come up with a route to get from the Ellipse to the Capitol 
6 or from the White House to the Capitol. 
7 Mrs. Murphy. But if they didn't want you driving into a crowd in November, 
8 would they have wanted you to drive into a crowd in January? 
9 Mr. Robinson. More than likely not. Not without securing a route. Not 
10 without assets in place. 
11 Mrs. Murphy. And you didn't --it didn't actually get to that level of escalation to 
12 the lieutenant because you hadn't yet gotten the confirmation that it was a certain thing 
13 that they were going to do? 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 Mr. Robinson. That is correct. 
Mrs. Murphy. Okay, great. Thank you. 
Ms. Quon. You're welcome. 
Ms. Lofgren? 
Mr. Aguilar? Mrs. Murphy? 
Any other questions? 
Mr. Robinson, thank you again for taking the time to meet with us
