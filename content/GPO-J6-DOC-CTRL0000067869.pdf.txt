Subject: Memo on Electoral College Processes and Battleground States 
FEDERAL LAW 
The Constitution and federal statutes establish a timetable following the November 
general election during which the electors of the electoral college convene in the 50 state capitals 
and in the District of Columbia, cast their votes for President and Vice President, and submit 
their votes through state officials to Congress. The electoral votes are scheduled to be opened 
before a joint session of Congress on January 6, 2020. 
The governor of each state is required by federal law "as soon as practicable" after the 
"final ascertainment" of the appointment of the electors, or "as soon as practicable" after the 
"final determination of any controversy or contest" concerning such election under its statutory 
procedure for election contests, to send to the Archivist of the United States by registered mail 
and under state seal, "a certificate of such ascertainment of the electors appointed," including the 
names and numbers of votes for each person for whose appointment as elector any votes were 
given (3 U.S.C. §6). 
On or before December 14, 2020, the governor of each state is required to deliver to the 
electors of the state six duplicate-originals of the certificate sent to the Archivist of the United 
States under state seal (3 U.S.C. §6). The electors of each state meet at the place designated by 
that state, on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December (December 14, 2020), to 
cast their votes for President and Vice President of the United States (United States Constitution, 
Amendment 12; 3 U.S.C. §§7,8). 
After the electors have voted in each state on December 14, 2020, they make and sign six 
certificates of their votes containing two distinct lists, one being the votes for President and the 
other the votes for Vice President. The law instructs the electors to attach to these lists a 
certificate furnished to them by the governor; to seal those certificates and to certify on them that 
these are all of the votes for President and Vice President; and then to send one certificate to the 
President of the Senate, and two certificates to the secretary of state of their state ( one to be held 
subject to the order of the President of the Senate). On the day after their meeting (December 15, 
2020), the electors are to forward by registered mail two of the certificates to the Archivist of the 
United States ( one to be held subject to the order of the President of the Senate), and one to the 
federal judge in the district where the electors have assembled (3 U.S.C. §§9,10,11).

CONFIDENTIAL AGSC 16-000066  Below are the Presidential Electors and the selection method for the six litigation states. The 
lists of electors were accurate as of the date of selection, but there were changes to the lists of 
electors in each state on the date of the Electoral College vote. State laws allow for the filling of 
vacancies if electors do not appear for the vote. The images included in this memo are 
examples from 2016 and are not from the 2020 election. 
ARIZONA 
The Arizona Republican Presidential Electors were chosen on August 14, 2020 by the State 
Party Chair in partnership with the Trump Campaign. Under state law, the State Party Chair 
makes the selections and submits the list to the Secretary of State, but the Trump campaign 
vetted and approved all of the electors before the list was submitted.

Sources of Law: The Sources of Law are the Arizona Election Code, and the U.S. 
Constitution.1 The specific section discussing the electoral college is A.R.S. § 16-212.2 There 
does not appear to be any relevant regulatory or sub-regulatory guidance governing the Electoral 
College in Arizona. Federal law requires electors to meet on December 14, 2020 (the first 
Monday after the Second Wednesday in December). Traditionally in Arizona, the electors meet 
at the State Capitol at a time requested by the Governor since the law has a minimum amount of 
details about Arizona's Electoral College process. 
How Arizona Handles Electoral College Voting: The Governor calls a meeting of the state's 
presidential electors on the date provided by federal law. The Secretary of State, as the State's 
top election official, prepares the Certificate of Vote. The Secretary of State is also the witness 
to the electors' signatures. A copy of the 2016 Certificate of Vote can be found below. The 
Governor and the Secretary of State already created and signed the Certificate of Ascertainment 
on the date that the Governor certified the election results for this election on November 30, 
2020.3 Once the presidential electors vote, the Governor will send the Certificate of 
Ascertainment and Certificate of Vote to all parties as provided by federal law.

The Georgia Republican Presidential Electors were chosen on March 16, 2020 by a vote from the 
State Executive Committee, at the recommendation of the State Party Chair. Under state law, the 
State Executive Committee chooses the electors, but in practice, the committee ratifies a list 
submitted by the State Party Chairman. The Trump campaign vetted and approved the electors 
prior to the State Executive Committee vote.

Sources of Law: The Chief Election Officer of Michigan is the Secretary of State ("SoS"), 
Jocelyn Benson. 8 The Secretary of State has "supervisory control" of election officials insofar as 
they implement Michigan's Election Code. The Secretary of State has limited rulemaking 
authority with respect to elections, that power being non-existent for most facets of an election, 
and in many places being shared with the State Board of Canvassers or more local elections 
boards.9 Regulations regarding the conduct of an election are minimal to non-existent.10 The 
same goes for Michigan Attorney General Opinions, interpreting Michigan's laws.11 The 
primary source of elections rules are therefore Michigan's Election code.12 
How Michigan Handles Electoral College Voting: There are two sections of the Michigan 
Elections code that deal with the post-election day processes for Presidential electors, the first is 
MI ST§ § 168.46, and 168.47. 
8 Michigan Statutes§ 168.21. The text of the law referenced by cites to the Michigan Statutes and their 
Election Code in this memo can be found here: [ HYPERLINK

CONFIDENTIAL AGSC 16-00007 4  Before the Electoral College meets, MI ST § 168.46 requires the Michigan governor to certify, 
under the seal of the state, to the United States Secretary of State, the names and addresses of the 
electors of Michigan. He must do this soon after the State Board of Canvassers determines the 
results of the election. When the governor finalizes his determination, he must send each elector 
a certificate of his or her election.13 
Michigan Statute § 168.47 deals with the convening of presidential electors for their vote.14 
Under MI ST § 168.47 Presidential electors meet in the Michigan Senate Chamber in Lansing 
Michigan at 2:00PM EST on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December 
following their election. 15 The ballot must have the name of the Elector on it, as well as the 
candidate to be voted for. 16 A picture of the ballot used by the elector is found on the next page. 
After casting their ballots in the Senate Chamber, the Electors then sign the "Certificate of 
Vote" attesting to their vote for the office of the President of the United States of America, and 
the office of the Vice President of the United States of America. This Certificate of Vote, a 
picture of which is two pafes below, is then sent to Congress and a variety of other entities such 
as the National Archives.1

The Nevada Republican Presidential Electors were chosen on June 13, 2020 at a virtual state 
convention. The Trump Campaign and the State Party worked together to create the slate of 
electors below that were unanimously approved by the body of the convention. The Trump 
campaign vetted and approved each name on the slate prior to the vote by the convention.

Sources of Law: Nevada has adopted the Uniform Faithful Presidential Electors Act.18 That law 
requires that all presidential electors sign a pledge to vote for the nominees for president and vice 
president who receive the highest number of votes in the state. t9 Under that law, political party 
chairs "shall submit to the Secretary of State each pledge signed pursuant to this section with the 
list of nominees for presidential elector and alternates" by "not later than the last Tuesday in 
August."20 The Secretary of State then submits a "certificate of ascertainment" "to the Archivist 
of the United States pursuant to 3 U.S.C. § 6" that includes a statement that"[ e Jach nominee for 
presidential elector shall serve as a presidential elector unless a vacancy occurs in the position of 
presidential elector held by that nominee for presidential elector before the conclusion of the 
meeting of presidential electors held pursuant to 3 U.S.C. § 7."21 
How Nevada Handles Electoral Voting: At the meeting of presidential electors, "[t]he 
Secretary of State shall preside" and "the nominees for presidential elector whose candidates for 
President and Vice President receive the highest number of votes in this State at the general 
election are the presidential electors."22 The Secretary of State must provide each presidential 
elector (as defined above) two ballots, one for President and one for Vice President.23 Electors 
then mark the applicable ballot for the person who received the highest number of votes at the 
general election and "shall sign and legibly print his or her name on the ballots and present the 
ballots to the Secretary of State. "24 
Once all presidential electors have presented their ballots to the Secretary of State, the Secretary 
of State shall examine each ballot. If a presidential elector presents both ballots marked with 
votes for the person who received the highest number of votes at the general election for the

Washington.

ballots. But if an elector "[ d]oes not present both ballots, presents an unmarked ballot or presents 
a ballot marked with a vote that does not conform with the provisions of subsection 1," then the 
Secretary of State shall refuse to accept either ballot from the presidential elector and "shall 
deem the presidential elector's position vacant."25 
That "vacancy must be filled pursuant to the provisions of NRS 298.065,"26 meaning that an 
alternate will be picked, but if no alternate is available, the remaining electors will nominate a 
qualified voter, who the Secretary of State will then appoint to fill the vacancy. 27 "The person 
appointed to fill the vacancy in the position of presidential elector, after signing the pledge 
described in NRS 298.065, shall mark both ballots and present both ballots to the Secretary of 
State pursuant to this section." 28 The law is clear that"[ o ]nly the votes accepted by the Secretary 
of State pursuant to this section may be recorded on the lists of votes made by the presidential 
electors pursuant to 3 U.S.C. § 9."29 
If the presidential electors whose votes are ultimately accepted by the Secretary of State differ 
from the electors who were listed on the initial certificate of ascertainment, then the Secretary of 
State will prepare an amended certificate of ascertainment that contains the names of persons 
who served as presidential electors send the amended certificate to the Archivist of the United 
States.30 
2. Additional mechanics 
In 2016, on December 19, the Secretary of State convened the electors in the state capitol 
building, in the Old Assembly Chambers, on the second floor, at 2pm, according to the public 
agenda press release for that mccting.31 That agenda included the following items: 
I. Call to Order 
II. Roll Call and Introductions 
III. Remarks about the Electoral College 
IV. Explanation of Procedures for Electoral College Meeting 
V. Administration of Oath to the Presidential Electors 
VI. Casting of Ballots for U.S. President and Vice President 
VII. Concluding Remarks 
VIII. Adjournment 
Based on this agenda, we expect that on Monday, December 14, 2020, the Secretary of State will 
convene the electors and follow the Uniform Faithful Electors Act's procedures as outlined 
above.

Sources of Law: Pennsylvania law provides for the appointment of slates of electors for each 
candidate for President and Vice President of the United States: 
The nominee of each political party for the office of President of the United States shall, 
within thirty days after his nomination by the National convention of such party, 
nominate as many persons to be the candidates of his party for the office of presidential 
elector as the State is then entitled to. If for any reason the nominee of any political party 
for President of the United States fails or is unable to make the said nominations within 
the time herein provided, then the nominee for such party for the office of Vice-President 
of the United States shall, as soon as may be possible after the expiration of thirty days, 
make the nominations. The names of such nominees, with their residences and post office 
addresses, shall be certified immediately to the Secretary of the Commonwealth by the 
nominee for the office of President or Vice-President, as the case may be, making the 
nominations. Vacancies existing after the date of nomination of presidential electors shall 
be filled by the nominee for the office of President or Vice-President making the original 
nomination. Nominations made to fill vacancies shall be certified to the Secretary of the 
Commonwealth in the manner herein provided for in the case of original nominations. 32 
25 P .S. § 2878. 
[PAGE] 
CONFIDENTIAL AGSC 16-000082  Pennsylvania law also provides for the election of the Commonwealth's presidential electors: 
At the general election to be held in the year 1940, and every fourth year thereafter, there 
shall be elected by the qualified electors of the Commonwealth, persons to be known as 
electors of President and Vice-President of the United States, and referred to in this act as 
presidential electors, equal in number to the whole number of senators and representatives 
to which this State may be entitled in the Congress of the United States.33 
After the Secretary of the Commonwealth receives, computes and certifies the returns of the 
election of presidential electors, see 25 P.S. § 3159, she "shall lay them before the Governor, 
who shall enumerate and ascertain the number of votes given for each person so voted for, and 
shall cause a certificate of election to be delivered to each person so chosen." 25 P.S. § 3166. 
The Governor of Pennsylvania recently issued a certificate of ascertainment for the 2020 
"d . I I 34 pres1 entia e ectors. 
The chosen electors "shall assemble at the seat of government of this Commonwealth, at 12 
o'clock noon of the day which is, or may be, directed by the Congress of the United States, and 
shall then and there perform the duties enjoined upon them by the Constitution and laws of the 
United States."35 
How Pennsylvania Handles Electoral Voting: As mentioned above, Pennsylvania's electors 
will meet at the seat of government in Pennsylvania, which is Harrisburg, at noon on December 
14, 2020, to cast their votes for President and Vice President. Wanda Murren, a spokesperson for 
the Department of State, recently said that the department was "still working out details on 
conducting the event while adhering to safety protocols related to the COVID pandemic."36 
Traditionally, the meeting of electors is a small, quiet, formal ceremony inside one of the 
Capitol's chambers. Id. After the appointment of several officers of the electoral delegation and 
a few other minor formalities, the electors proceed to vote for President and Vice President by 
writing their votes down on ballots and depositing the ballots into a ballot box. After the votes 
are counted and the count is announced, the electors sign certificates with the state's electoral 
votes that are sent to Congress.37

How Wisconsin Handles Electors Voting: The electors for president and vice president shall 
meet at the state capitol following the presidential election at 12:00 noon the first Monday after 
the 2nd Wednesday in December. If there is a vacancy in the office of an elector due to death, 
refusal to act, failure to attend or other cause, the electors present shall immediately proceed to 
fill by ballot, by a plurality of votes, the electoral college vacancy. When all electors are present, 
or the vacancies filled, they shall perform their required duties under the constitution and laws of 
the United States.38 
The presidential electors, when convened, shall vote by ballot for that person for president and 
that person for vice president who are, respectively, the candidates of the political party which 
nominated them under [ HYPERLINK "https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/8/18" ], the 
candidates whose names appeared on the nomination papers filed under [ HYPERLINK 
"https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/8/20" ], or the candidate or candidates who filed 
their names under [ HYPERLINK "https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/8/185/2" ], except 
that at least one of the persons for whom the electors vote may not be an inhabitant of this state. 
A presidential elector is not required to vote for a candidate who is deceased at the time of the 
meeting. [ HYPERLINK "https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/7/ii/75" ]. 
There is little outside guidance on the meeting of presidential electors in Wisconsin. The 
Wisconsin Election Commission has historically put out a notice of the presidential elector 
meeting during the end of the week leading up to the meeting. 39 In other words, we will know 
by Friday, December 11, 2020, the time and place of the Electoral College meeting in 
\Visconsin. Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers issued the ·wisconsin Certificate of Ascertainment 
on November 30, 2020.40
