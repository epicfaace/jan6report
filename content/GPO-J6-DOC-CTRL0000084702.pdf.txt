Molly, Hope you are doing well. Chris Ruddy ofNewsmax had us do this poll for his channel. They released it 
last week and Chris spoke to the President Thanksgiving Day. Our poll really supports the President's statement 
in his video today. You can print the slides in the link for the President and if he wants to discuss any of it, just 
let me know? Keep up the great work. Thank you.
