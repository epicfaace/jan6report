3 - So let's go on the record at 11:04 a.m. 
Good morning. This is a transcribed interview of Ms. Janet Buhler conducted by 
4 the House Select Committee to investigate the January 6th attack on the United States 
5 Capitol pursuant to House Resolution 503. 
6 At this time, I'd ask the witness to please state your full name and spell your last 
7 name for the record. 
8 
9 
10 Ms. Buhler. Janet West Buhler, B-u-h-1-e-r. 
- Thank you very much. 
This will be a staff-led interview. Members, of course, may choose to ask 
11 questions if they join. I don't see anybody who has joined so far. 
12 So in the room today are myself, investigative counsel, and -
13 -investigative counsel for the Select Committee. 
14 At this time, could counsel please state your name for the record? 
15 Mr. Tolman. Yep. Counsel for Ms. Buhler, Brett Tolman, T-o-1-m-a-n. 
16 - Thank you very much, Mr. Tolman. 
17 So as noted, there is an official reporter transcribing the record of this interview, 3 
18 so please wait until each question is completed before you begin your next response, and 
19 we will try to wait until your response is complete before we ask our next question. 
20 The stenographer cannot record nonverbal responses, such as shaking your head, 
21 so it is important that you answer each question with an audible verbal response. 
22 We ask that you provide complete answers based on your best recollection. If 
23 the question is not clear, please ask for clarification. If you do not know the answer, 
24 please simply say so. 
25 There are a couple of things I just want to cover with you before we get into the  4 
1 questioning. 
2 So, first, it is important that you understand that this interview is voluntary. If at 
3 any time you would like to stop speaking with us, that is your choice. 
4 Similarly, if at any point you need to discuss something with your attorney in 
5 private, please let us know, and we will take a break so you can have that conversation. 
6 Second, this interview is not under oath. But because this is a formal 
7 congressional investigation, you are obligated under Federal law to tell the truth, the 
8 same as if you were speaking with the FBI or DOJ. 
9 It is unlawful to deliberately provide false information to Congress. For this 
10 interview, providing false information could result in criminal penalties for false 
11 statements. 
12 Do you understand? 
13 
14 
15 Ms. Buhler. Yes. 
- Thankyou. 
Third, you are not obligated to keep the fact of this interview and what we 
16 discussed confidential. You are free to tell whomever you wish that you met with us, 
17 including the prosecutor or judge on your case, or you can tell no one at all. That is your 
18 decision. 
19 Fourth, the select committee is separate and independent from the Department 
20 of Justice. We have no involvement with the prosecutions, and the DOJ is not a partner 
21 with the select committee in this investigation. 
22 The subcommittee also is not a party to your criminal case and is not agreeing to 
23 submit anything on your behalf to the judge, nor can we make any representation 
24 whether, if you tell the judge you met with us, that the judge will be more favorable to 
25 you during sentencing.  5 
1 Fifth, we have agreed with your attorney not to share the substance of what you 
2 say with the Department of Justice prior to your sentencing, but there are two possible 
3 exceptions. 
4 If you told us about evidence of a crime that we thought law enforcement was 
5 unaware of, or if we had reason to believe you lied during this interview, then we would 
6 be obligated to tell DOJ or another appropriate law enforcement agency. 
7 And, if you tell the judge that you met with us, please understand that that may 
8 prompt questions from the judge about what you said and whether it is consistent with 
9 your prior statements and acceptance of responsibility. And if the judge starts asking 
10 questions, we may get asked to respond and divulge what you said. 
11 Logistically, just let us know if you need any breaks or if you'd like to discuss 
12 anything with your attorney. We're happy to go off the record for a little bit if you need 
13 to for whatever reason. 
14 So as I noted, myself and might be asking questions as this goes 
15 along. If we're ever talking over each or you can't hear us or we're just not clear, please 
16 let us know and we'll repeat the question. 
17 So that does all make sense to you, Ms. Buhler? 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 Ms. Buhler. Yes. 
- Great. 
Q EXAMINATION 
BY-: 
And with that, we'll get started with a little bit about your background. 
So where are you from? 
A 
Q Originally or --
Yeah. Where do you live now? I should've been more clear. I'm sorry.  1

3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
10 in Idaho. 
Q I live in --near Salt Lake City, Utah. 
Okay. Which town? 
Kaysville. 
And how long have you lived there? 
About 17 years. 
Were you born and raised in Utah or -Â­
No. 
Where did you --where were you born? 
Okay. Well, I was born in Utah, just like in a clinic, but I was always raised 
Okay. Thank you. 11 
12 
13 And what is your educational background? 
A I have a degree in fashion design from Brigham Young University, and I am 
14 one credit short of a degree in piano performance from the University of Utah. 
15 Q Understood. Thank you. 
16 So what do you do for a living now? 
17 A I live in both worlds. So I teach piano and violin lessons and --well, I used 
18 to teach fashion at the college until I was fired for January 6th. 
19 Q Understood. 
20 So now we're going to get into some more questions about, as you just noted, 
21 January 6th, and the lead-up to it. 
22 In general, how would you describe your level of political engagement 
23 throughout former President Trump's term? 
24 
25 A 
Q Throughout his term? As zero. 
Zero. So when did you start getting engaged in political events? 6  1 
2 
3 A 
Q 
A Well, I'm not really. I don't do anything political. 
Or when did you start really following politics? 
Well, I mean, I just watch whatever is on the news. Like, I don't --I don't 
4 know if that's what you mean or --
5 Q Yeah, that's more or less. When were you --so you said you were not 
6 really involved politically during President Trump's term, but did you pay close attention 
7 to politics during his term? 7 
8 A Okay. If you --when you say "involved," do you mean, like, participating in, 
9 like --like, I don't know, a candidate's campaign or something like that, or do you just 
10 mean, like, watching news or --I'm not sure what you mean by "involved." 
11 Q I'll clarify for you. Thank you. I guess then there are two parts to the 
12 question. 
13 First, I think you answered --and correct me if I'm wrong --you were not involved 
14 in the sense of being part of a campaign or working for anyone in office, correct? 
15 
16 
17 
18 A 
Q 
A 
Q Correct. 
Right. Did you go to any rallies during President Trump's term? 
No. 
Okay. And then --but did you follow politics closely during President 
19 Trump's term on the news or otherwise? 
20 A I mean, just sometimes. My husband is --like, watches a lot more than I 
21 do. Just like whenever the TV would be on, I would watch basically. 
22 
23 Q 
A Okay. Did you ever read print publications about political news? 
Like, we don't --I mean, so we don't subscribe to a newspaper or anything 
24 like that. I guess every once in a while I do. Well, during his Presidency, I don't think I 
25 subscribed to any even email newsletters or anything. So I was just watching  1 whatever --or listening to the radio, things like that. 
2 
3 
4 
5 Q Okay. So mostly radio. And was it local or national news? 
A Local. 
Q Okay. Did you follow political news on social media ever? 
A So I have --when I was on Facebook I had, you know, because I have friends 8 
6 from all different political beliefs. So what they would post, I would look at. I wouldn't 
7 say --I'm just trying to remember back that far. I mean, other than that, not really. 
8 
9 
10 Q Okay. So you said Facebook. Do you also have a Twitter? 
A 
Q I don't have Twitter. 
Did you follow any other social media sites? And I'm going to go through a 
11 list of them, and if yes, we'll go into it. If no --oh, go ahead. 
12 _, I'm going to follow up. 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 You said you don't have Twitter now. Did you have Twitter in 2020? 
Ms. Buhler. No. I missed the whole Twitter thing. 
Okay. Okay. Just want to make sure that's what it was. 
Thank you, 
BY-: , for clarifying. 
Q Okay. So I'll go through a list, so just bear with me. If you haven't heard 
19 of any of them, just say you were not engaged. 
20 Did you use Parler back in 2020? 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 A I think I was on Parler for a minute, yeah. 
Q And was that right before or after the election, do you remember? 
A Oh, gosh. It might've been after. 
Q Okay. Do you remember what you followed on Parler? 
A I mean, there was --it was political, I would say. As far as who it was -- 1 
2 
3 Q 
A It's okay if you can't remember exactly. 
I don't exactly remember. 
Q That's okay. Would you say that you got a lot of information about 
4 President Trump or about other political events on Parler? 
5 A I mean, there was a lot of talk about, gosh, all kinds of things, you know, 9 
6 from the election to just other political figures. Just like a variety of just politics, I guess. 
7 Q Would you say you relied on Parler as a source more than the local news or 
8 about the same? 
9 A Oh, no, I didn't rely on Parler at all. I mean, it was just more of, like, 
10 comparing. Like, I want to --I kind of like to compare what I saw on the news to what 
11 was said on Parler, just, like, try to make my own opinion about it. 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 Q Thank you. 
Did you use Reddit? 
A No. 
Q Telegram? 
A Telegram, I didn't start until --because, you know, Parler, like, died. So it 
17 was after that, that I heard about Telegram. 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 Q So that was in --later, January 2021. So you didn't use Telegram before? 
A No, huh-uh. 
Q Okay. That's totally fine. 
Have you heard of GETTR? 
A I've heard of it. 
Q Do you use it? 
A I'm not on it, no. 
Q TheDonald.win?  A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A No. 
Gab? 
I think I did create an account on there, but I never used it. 
Okay. Wimkin? 
I don't know that one. 
Were you ever involved with 4chan? 
I don't know what that is. 10 
1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 Q And did you follow President Trump specifically on any of those social media 
10 
11 sites? 
A 
Q I might have on Parler. I'm not sure. 
Okay. So right after the 2020 election, did you have any concerns about 
12 how the election went? 
13 
14 
15 A Yeah. Yeah, I did. 
Q And what were they? 
A Well, I was just concerned because the election went differently than other 
16 elections that I remember. 
17 
18 Q In what way? 
A Just usually we knew by, like, the end of that day, the election day, like, who 
19 the winner was, but it, like, went on for weeks. And even in Utah, we had a House race 
20 that was, like, they couldn't --it took weeks for them to finish counting. So I just 
21 thought that was a little odd. 
22 Q Would you say that your concerns rose to the level that you thought the 
23 election was stolen from former President Trump? 
24 A I don't know that I would say stolen, but just I'm like --I was concerned 
25 about it. I would've liked, you know, some more investigation, just --but I wouldn't say  11 
1 that I think that it's stolen. But I just kind of have, you know, just questions. 
2 Q All right. Do you remember precisely when you started to feel that way? 
3 I know you mentioned the length of time that it took. But was there, like, a moment 
4 where those concerns crystallized? 
5 A I guess, like, the next morning after the election, it was like, "Oh, they're not 
6 done counting yet, huh," you know. And then so from then, like, every day would be, 
7 like, "I can't believe they're not done counting," like, it just kind of got, like, just more 
8 interesting, I guess, to me. 
9 Q Okay. Understood. 
10 Do you remember seeing messages on Facebook or Parler in the days before the 
11 election about the possibility of the election being stolen? 
12 A Well, I mean, I think we've all seen messages like that. So, I mean, Trump, 
13 himself, is always saying it. 
14 
15 Q 
A Do you think that played into any of your concerns? 
I don't know. Because you never know about him, like, whether he's saying 
16 something that's really overexaggerated or not. So --
17 
18 
19 Q 
A 
Q I'm sorry. Go ahead. 
I mean, that was it. 
Okay. What about other political figures or people like Rudy Giuliani or 
20 someone else who before the election was talking about that? 
21 
22 A 
Q Before the election? 
Yeah. Just like trying to figure out in the days before the election, did you 
23 see any messaging that might've contributed to your concerns after the election? 
24 
25 A 
Q Oh, not before the election, no. 
Okay. So then after the election, did you start getting involved in any  1 activities related to alleged voter fraud or election insecurities? 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 A 
Q No. 
, do you have a question? 
Yes. Thank you. 
Ms. Buhler, I just wanted to go back. You said you recalled former 12 
7 President Trump talking about possible issues with the election. What do you recall him 
8 saying that might've stood out in your mind? 
9 A Well, I mean, this was after the election. And, oh, gosh, I guess I don't 
10 remember exactly what he said, but he's always, even now, still saying it was rigged or 
11 some --or whatever. 
12 
13 
14 Q Got you. 
A Some kind of language like that. 
Q Thank you. And do you recall any terms such as Stop the Steal 
15 or #StoptheSteal after the election? 
16 A I mean, like, a long --a ways after that. Like, I mostly heard that when I 
17 went to the--went to Washington, D.C., is when I really heard most of that. 
18 
19 
20 
21 Q Okay. We'll get into that later then. Thank you. 
- Thankyou, 
BY-: 
Q So you said you did not participate in any rallies or activities following the 
22 general election? 
23 
24 A No. 
Q Just for the record, you didn't go to attend the November 14th rally in 
25 Washington, D.C.?  1 
2 
3 
4 A No. 
Q And not the December 12th rally in Washington, D.C.? 
A No. 
Q Okay. Thank you. 
5 So then what really made you decide that you wanted to travel to Washington, 
6 D.C., for the January 6th rally? 
7 A So this is mostly kind of like the dynamics of the family. So my 13 
8 husband --like, we're a blended family. And his daughter's husband --and, you know, I 
9 mean, I know him, but I wouldn't say I know him real well. But he wanted to go. He 
10 was like, you know, a really big Trump supporter. 
11 And he called me --I mean, it was, like, 2 days before the rally, maybe 3 days 
12 before the rally --and he said, "Listen, I really want to go. And I don't have anybody to 
13 go with. And so will you go with me?" 
14 And out of the idea of, like, creating better relationships in the family, like, that's 
15 why I went, because I --he really wanted to go. 
16 And he's the one that, like, doesn't, what, blend well in the family, like, he 
17 doesn't --like, not everybody gets along with him. 
18 So I just thought, okay, this will be a good way to kind of bond with him and, like, 
19 bring the family closer together, that kind of thing. 
20 
21 
22 
23 Q Were you surprised that he called you? 
A I was kind of surprised, yeah. 
Q Why is that? 
A Because I wouldn't say we're close. That's why, you know. And plus, it 
24 was, like, 3 days before. So I was kind of, like, well, that's really soon. 
25 Q Why did --why would you say you weren't close?  1 
2 
3 close? 
4 A Why weren't we close? 
Q Well, yeah. What about your relationship made you think you were not 
A Well, so this is her, like, sixth husband, like, he's pretty new to the family. 
5 And, you know, you just were like, well, is this going to last? You know, how much 
6 should I put into this relationship because she might divorce him? You know what I 
7 mean, like, just --
8 Q Okay. So how long did you know him, I guess? 14 
9 A Well, trying to think when they got married, because they got married after 
10 we did. So maybe 6 --5, 6 years. 
11 Q Okay. Do you know if he reached out to anyone else in your family to go 
12 with him to January 6th? 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 A Actually, I don't. I didn't ever ask him. 
Q Did your husband talk about it at all? 
A Talk about what? 
Q Talk about going with your, I guess, stepson-in-law. 
A About me going with the stepson-in-law? 
Q Right. I should've been more clear. 
Did he talk about going with his son-in-law to Washington, D.C., on January 6th? 
A Oh, my husband didn't --he never was invited or never said he wanted to go 
21 or anything. 
22 
23 Q 
A How about your stepdaughter? 
I don't know. She --what I understood is that she had work, like --I don't 
24 know if she would've gone or not if she could have. I'm not --I don't know. 
25 Q Did you ever speak with your son-in-law about political issues?  15 
1 A So before the election, probably not. I think it was more after the election 
2 that, you know --which we don't see them that much. So he --I might've seen him 
3 twice between, like, November 3rd and January 6th, like at Christmas, I think we saw 
4 them, and maybe one other time. And, I mean, I don't make a habit of calling them on 
5 the phone at all. 
6 So, I mean, it would just have been, like, within family get-togethers where, you 
7 know --I mean, I knew he was, like, a Trump supporter. I mean, I did know that. 
8 didn't know how deep, like, how, you know, deep his support was at all. 
9 Q 
10 Christmas? 
11 
12 A 
Q Okay. Did you talk at all about Washington, D.C., when you saw him at 
I --gosh, I just don't remember. 
Do you remember seeing any tweets or social media messaging about 
13 President Trump around that time about inviting his supporters to Washington, D.C., for 
14 a, quote/unquote, wild sort of rally? 
15 
16 
17 
18 yeah. 
19 A 
Q 
A 
Q I do remember, I mean, hearing that there was going to be a rally, for sure. 
Okay. So around Christmas you knew there would be a rally? 
Yeah, I think --yeah, yeah, yeah, because that's pretty close to January, 
Did you follow your stepson-in-law on social media apps? Did you talk to 
20 him on, like, Parler? 
21 A No. 
22 Q So did he ever explain to you why he called you to go with him to 
23 Washington, D.C.? 
24 A I'm a person that likes to travel, so I think --and we've had, like, you know, 
25 where I've never --up until that time, I've never had any kind of disagreement with him or  16 
1 any kind of, you know, bad interaction with him. So, you know, it's been a very, what, 
2 agreeable, I guess, relationship. So that may be why he called me. 
3 Q But had you two ever taken a trip together before? 
4 A No. 
5 Q Do you --was he aware that you also --I'm assuming he had concerns about 
6 the election. So was he aware that you also had concerns about the election? 
7 A Oh, probably. I'm sure we probably talked about that at some point. 
8 Q And do you think that that played into his decision to ask you to go with 
9 him? 
10 
11 A 
Q Probably. 
Were there other people --did other people in your family share similar 
12 concerns, or was it mostly the two of you? 
13 A I would say our family is kind of divided, very divided on politics. So, I 
14 mean, there are some that are more on the conservative side and some on the more 
15 liberal side. And that's in my --within my husband's children. 
16 So that's probably why, because I would --I would say I'm more conservative, so 
17 that's why he would have talked to me. 
18 And, like, other people in the family, like, could not have even afforded to go, 
19 couldn't have bought an airline ticket. So that's another thing, is he knew that I could. 
20 Q Okay. So was it --you said 3 days before. So January 3rd is when you 
21 decided to go to Washington, D.C., or right around there? 
22 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A 
Q Yeah, I would say it was on, like, Sunday before. Is that the 3rd? 
That is, yes. 
Yeah. 
Okay. For information about January 6th, since you said you were aware of  1 it, but were you relying on your stepson-in-law for information about what would 
2 happen, or were you looking on social media? 
3 A So at that point when he said he wanted to go, I wanted to --I remember 
4 getting on VouTube, and I saw some, like --follow this sort of religious guy that talks 
5 about religion and politics. And he said that his --he was going to have a group of 
6 people that were going to meet up there. And I saw that, and I thought that would be 
7 good, to kind of meet with that group. 
8 Q Okay. Do you remember the name of the group or the social media site 
9 you were following? 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q This is, like, Professor Toto, he calls himself. 
Is that T-o-t-o? 
Yeah. 
Okay. Do you mind me asking what kind of religion or religious group? 
He's --oh, he calls himself Great --Great Harvest Ministries, I think. 
Okay. 
So just Christian, I guess. 
And where would they --where were they meeting up? Were they riding 
18 in a bus to Washington, D.C.? 
19 A No. It was just, like, they had a meeting point, and they were saying, you 
20 know, come meet at this point. 
21 
22 Q 
A Where was that? 
Well, see, that's the thing, is since I've never been to Washington, D.C.,, I 
23 could kind of generally, like, know somewhere near the monument. It was, like, on a 
24 corner by the monument somewhere. And so that's what I wanted to do. 
25 Q Okay. Was there any other information you were getting about the day 17  18 
1 on line? 
A No. 
Q Did you ever end up meeting up with that group? 
A No, because my son-in-law did not want to. 
Q And was that a disagreement you had before you left? 2 
3 
4 
5 
6 A Well, he agreed to it before we left, but then when we got there, he said, "I 
7 don't want to do that." 
8 Q I think we'll get back to that in a little bit. But just to close the loop on the 
9 social media stuff, were you getting news about January 6th from Parler? 
10 
11 
12 A Probably. 
Q Do you remember any specific messaging or rhetoric? 
A So I'm one of those people that's an observer, so I don't --I didn't ever post 
13 anything or message anything. I just was, like, watching what was going on. So I had 
14 no message from anyone. 
15 
16 
17 
18 Q Well, what do you remember observing? 
A What, on Parler? 
Q Yeah. 
A I think just --it was mostly people saying that they were going. I mean, I 
19 just --I honestly just don't even remember. It's just been that --and I can't --I mean, I 
20 can't look it up now. So I have no --I just don't remember at all. 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 Q That's okay. I'll ask maybe a couple questions that might help. 
Do you remember people talking about taking a bus to Washington, D.C.? 
A I don't think so. 
Q Okay. How about anyone talking or using the word "caravan"? 
A I don't think so.  19 
1 Q That's okay. And do you remember if there were any specific accounts that 
2 you noticed were organizing people to go to January 6th? 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 A No. 
Q Totally fine. 
So when did you end up leaving Washington, D.C.? 
A So it was hard to find a flight that went direct, so we left Tuesday morning. 
Q January 5th? 
A Uh-huh. 
Q What time did you arrive in D.C.? 
A Like 6 p.m. 
Q And it was just you and your stepson-in-law traveling together? 
Do you remember where it was --oh, sorry. For the record, you nodded "yes" to 
13 that question of --
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 A Oh. 
Q --it was just you and your stepson-in-law? 
A Yes. 
Q Thank you. 
Where in Washington, D.C., did you end up staying? 
A I think it's called the Row Hotel, the Row. 
Q Was that in the District? 
A I don't know what you mean by that. 
Q Sorry. Was it in Washington, D.C., itself or was it in Maryland or Virginia? 
A Yeah, it was in Washington, D.C., I believe. 
Q Okay. And I know you didn't end up meeting up with the Great 
25 Harvest --sorry if I got that wrong --Great Harvest group. But did you meet up with  1 anybody else when you were here? 
2 
3 
4 
5 A No. 
Q All right. Did you expect any violence at January 6th? 
A 
Q No. No. I would not have gone. 
Understood. But then I guess what was really your goal? Why did you 20 
6 say yes to coming to Washington, D.C.? What did you want to do when you were here? 
7 A Okay. So I've --like I said, I've never been to a rally before. That sounded 
8 interesting to me. And, you know, a lot of people in Utah and friends that we know, a 
9 friend of ours has been --had been to two rallies and she said, "Oh, yeah, that they're 
10 really great, they're really friendly, the people are great." So she made it sound like a 
11 great thing to go to. And she did not end up going. 
12 
13 And --sorry, what was your question? 
Q That's okay. It was, what were you --like, what was your goal in coming to 
14 Washington, D.C.? 
15 A Oh, okay. So, again, I wanted to support my son-in-law. I have never 
16 been to Washington, D.C., and I thought this would be a good time to go. And I just 
17 wanted to be part of the group. 
18 
19 
20 
21 Q When you say "the group" --
A Like, the entire --the rally, part of the entire. 
Q And why was it important to be part of the group? 
A I just wanted to get, like, maybe a perspective outside of my local area, to 
22 just kind of get a feel, like, you know, because Utah's a pretty conservative place. So I 
23 thought here's a chance to get a perspective from, you know, other parts of the country, 
24 see other people there from different areas, see if they have concerns, how concerned 
25 are they.  21 
1 Like, I was just trying to figure out really --you know, because I questioned myself 
2 at the time, was I overly concerned, was I being swayed by, you know, things I saw in the 
3 media or whatever. Like, I just wanted to get a sense of really what was going on. 
4 Q So did you expect people who attended the rally not to be concerned about 
5 the election? 
6 
7 A 
Q No, I did expect them to be concerned. 
Right. But you said you were looking for different perspectives. I'm trying 
8 to figure out, what were those different perspectives? 
9 A Well, I don't mean perspective as not concerned. I mean, just, like, the 
10 level of concern. Like what did they feel like's going on in their State? Is it just, like, 
11 the Presidential election, or did they feel like it was their other elections, you know, their 
12 local elections, or --
13 
14 
15 Q 
A 
Q Okay. Was there talk of stolen local elections too? 
No, I wouldn't say so. 
Right. So is it fair to say then, that in addition to being there to build a 
16 relationship with your son-in-law, you also wanted to be part of the group raising a voice 
17 about election concerns? 
A Yes. -, do you have a follow-up? 
Yes. 18 
19 
20 
21 So you mentioned earlier that you weren't expecting violence or anything. Do 
22 you recall seeing messages on line or through the President or anything about, like, 
23 revolution or 1776, anything like that? 
24 Ms. Buhler. No. 
25 Okay.  1 
2 How about civil war? 
Ms. Buhler. No. I mean, it's --I would think that would seem unsafe if it was 
3 saying revolution. I mean, I'm not that kind of a person that can handle that. 
Okay. That's all I had. Thanks. 
Thank you,

6 
7 Q So then you arrived in D.C., in the evening January 5th. Did you attend any 
8 rallies in Washington, D.C., on January 5th? 
9 A No. By the time we got to our hotel and ate something it was, like, 9, 9 
10 o'clock, maybe. 
11 Q Okay. And then in the morning what did you do? January 6th morning, 
12 I'm sorry, to be clear. 
13 A Well, so my stepson-in-law wanted to go early. So he wanted to meet at 
14 7:30 in the lobby and then make our way to the --Ellipse? Is that what it was? So I 
15 kind of just went with his plan. 
16 
17 Q And that's when you had expected to meet up with this group? 
A No. I expected that we would make our way there, and then I 
18 would --because I know that they weren't meeting until, like, maybe 10 or something. 
19 
20 Q Were you still in contact with this group, or were you just following? 
A Oh, I never was in contact with them. I was just hoping to, like, meet, meet 
21 up kind of, you know. 
22 Q Understood. Were there any speakers at the rally you were particularly 
23 excited to see? 
24 A Well, I didn't really know who was speaking, except I knew Trump was 
25 speaking, and that's all.  1 
2 
3 Q Okay. 
A Yeah. Yeah. 
Q And when you were in the crowd, did you have conversations with other 
4 people? 
5 
6 
7 A Yes. 
Q And what were people talking about? 
A I mean, it was --it was very friendly, and, I mean, it was, like, you know, 
8 "Hey, where are you from?" and, you know, just talking about things like that. And 23 
9 then, I mean, we were all just waiting, really, for it to start. I mean, I remember talking 
10 to people, but I don't, like, remember the specifics of our conversations. 
11 Q Okay. Did you see people dressed up in military fatigues, with, like, 
12 military-style backpacks? 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 A Not at that time. 
Okay. -BY 
Q Yeah, I might've missed this. 
So what time did you actually get to the Ellipse? 
A Well, we left our hotel at 7:30. 
Q Okay. Did you take the train there? Did you walk? 
A We --so when we went to the lobby, there was --there were two other men 
22 there who said that they were going down to the rally --and they were from 
23 Michigan --and they said, "Let's share an Uber together." 
24 Q Got it. And I also might've missed this. You got in on January 5th? Is 
25 that when you arrived to D.C.,?  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 A Yes. 
Q And you didn't go to any of the rallies on January 5th? 
A No. 
Q Got it. Got it. Okay. 
So you get to the Ellipse. What was the process for actually getting in? Were 
6 you in the inside part of the Ellipse, or were you out by the Washington Monument? 
7 
8 
9 
10 A We were not inside. 
Q Okay. 
A We were on the outer perimeter of that. 
Q And were you near the Washington Monument, or where were you on the 
11 outer perimeter? 24 
12 A So we thought about going in the perimeter but then there was, like, a really 
13 long line, and, like, you had to go through, like, a security thing. So we just were kind of 
14 like we didn't want to do that. 
15 And so we stood --there was, like --there were some speakers. We were kind of 
16 right by these big speakers. 
17 And then my son-in-law got a little impatient and he wanted to walk around. So 
18 then we ended up walking right up by the monument and just kind of --I think he wanted 
19 to find a better place to be able to see. 
20 But then it was really cold. So then the, you know, more separated from people 
21 you were, then the more cold it was. So then we kind of walked around there and then 
22 kind of came back down closer, back by the speaker again. But then we couldn't get as 
23 close because people had filled in. 
24 Q And I guess I missed this too. What was the significance of coming to D.C., 
25 for January 6th? Like, why was January 6th the date that you feel like folks were coming  25 
1 to the city? 
Well, I mean, they were coming for the rally, so -- 2 
3 A 
Q Nothing about Congress? You don't think there was any proceedings going 
4 on in Congress that people came to D.C., for? 
5 And I'll be blunt. Do you think the rally and folks came to D.C., for the 
6 certification of the electoral vote? Was that in the back of your mind when you came to 
7 D.C.,? 
8 A In the back of my mind, I wanted Congress to understand, like, how many 
9 people were there that were concerned about the election. In my mind, that's what. 
10 just wanted to be part of that, like, visibility of how many people. 
11 Q But were you tracking that January 6th was the actual date that Congress 
12 was certifying the electoral college? 
13 
14 
15 
16 A Oh, yeah, I knew that that was the --
Q Okay. 
A Yeah. 
Q Okay. So that was part of the reason why you were willing to come to D.C., 
17 from the West for January 6th? 
18 A Just to be part of the whole thing. I wouldn't say that it was because of 
19 Congress. Like, it was, like, the whole picture. 
20 Q Right. I'm just saying part of that picture was the fact that Congress was 
21 certifying the vote. 
22 
23 
24 
25 A Yeah. 
Q Okay. 
A Yeah. 
Mr. Tolman. Can I clarify a question?  26 
1 
2 Janet, was the certification of the vote why you went to Congress --went to D.C.,? 
Ms. Buhler. No. It was part of it. Like, I wanted to go to the rally. That was 
3 my --that was the thing I wanted to go to. 
4 
5 Mr. Tolman. There were, obviously --
Ms. Buhler. I knew they were certifying. I knew they were certifying. But I 
6 was coming to go to the rally. 
7 Mr. Tolman. And, obviously, you knew there were others that were probably 
8 there because of the certification. 
9 
10 
11 Ms. Buhler. Yeah. I mean, it was just part of the day. 
Mr. Tolman. Okay. Thanks. 
Actually, I'll follow up. Thank you, Mr. Tolman, for that. I'll 
12 follow up. 
13 So did you hear others in the crowd that weren't there really for the rally, that 
14 were just there for the certification? 
15 Ms. Buhler. I think that became obvious later when Trump was speaking. And 
16 then some people started saying, "They're about to vote." And then I feel like then you 
17 could see who was concerned about that, because people started just, like, leaving. 
18 Okay. I'll turn it over to- Thank you. 
19 Thank you, and Mr. Tolman. 
20 BY-
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 Q Would you say a lot of people there were talking about certification? 
A I mean, it was just a general topic of the day because it was part of the day. 
Q But were people talking about trying to stop certification? 
A 
Q No. Not that I --not anyone I was talking to. 
Did anyone talk about Stop the Steal?  27 
1 A That was kind of just a general, like, chant that was happening during the 
2 day. 
3 Q Okay. 
4 A Like, people would just start saying it. 
5 Q How did you take the meaning of Stop the Steal? 
6 A Well, I didn't take it as, like, a thing that would happen that day. I just 
7 thought it was a general, like, process thing that people were talking about, like, over 
8 time. 
9 Because I had seen --like, I saw the press conference with, you know, Giuliani and 
10 Sidney Powell and that press conference where they were talking about lawsuits and 
11 things like that. To me, that's what I thought Stop the Steal was, was that, like, legal 
12 process and that it would be sorted out that way in the courts. 
13 Q Weren't those lawsuits specifically aimed at trying to show that President 
14 Trump should be the electoral college winner? 
15 A Well, I thought those lawsuits were to, like, find out in a legal way whether 
16 that there was anything to those claims. 
17 Q Sure. Let me be a little clearer. 
18 When you said you thought Stop the Steal was a long-term process, do you mean 
19 past President Biden's inauguration, like, a political movement in the long-term, or did 
20 you mean the lawsuits, the short-term? 
21 A No. I mean --no, it can't be a short-term. Like, the legal process takes, 
22 like, a long time. 
23 Q Right. But these lawsuits were aimed at keeping President Trump in office, 
24 correct? 
25 A I thought they were more for, like, just finding out the evidence.  28 
1 Q What did Mr. Giuliani --or what do you remember Mr. Giuliani and 
2 Ms. Powell saying about that evidence? 
3 A Just that there were questions about all kinds of things, like, from, like, 
4 the --I guess at that time they were talking about the vote count, the counting machines 
5 or something. 
6 Q And I'll tie this back to January 6th and Stop the Steal. Were people talking 
7 about Stop the Steal in the sense of President Trump won the election? 
8 A You know, if I look back, you know, what I think in my mind is different than 
9 what other people think in their mind. So, you know, now I can look back and say that's 
10 probably what they were thinking, is let's stop it today. 
11 Q Understood. I didn't mean to ask you to read their minds. I'm sorry. 
12 In terms of what you were hearing, were people talking about Stop the Steal in 
13 the sense of President Trump is our President and needs to be re-inaugurated? 
14 A I mean, I don't think so, like, not in the group that I was around. They were 
15 just really reasonable people. I don't remember that. 
16 
17 
18 
19 - Okay. 
~ 
BY 
Q Yeah. I guess, were you expecting, like, a big reveal of some sort from 
20 President Trump during the rally on January 6th? 
21 
22 
23 
24 A 
Q 
A 
Q I was expecting that he might have had something different to say. 
Did he say anything of that nature, do you remember? 
Anything different than what I'd heard before? 
Did he --you said you were expecting something new just now. Did he say 
25 anything new on January 6th about the election?  1 
2 A No. 
Q And what was your, I guess, response to that? How did you feel after you 
3 didn't learn anything new? 
4 A Well, I mean, when he started talking, you know, I just thought, well, he's 
5 said this before. 
Q Right. 29 
6 
7 A And so then I thought, well, he'll probably, like --maybe he's leading up to it 
8 or something. But then as he went on, so, you know, it was going on for a long time, 
9 and it just seemed to be, like, he wasn't going to say anything new. 
10 Q So we've heard from other witnesses that they were --I mean --and I'm 
11 quoting them --disappointed that they didn't learn anything new from President Trump's 
12 speech on January 6th. 
13 I guess that's what I'm trying to get at. Were you disappointed, or did you have 
14 no feelings after you didn't learn anything new? 
15 A So, kind of cynical that way, because I just thought, "Oh, well, that's a 
16 politician for you. They tell you they're going to do something or say something, and 
17 then it's just the same old thing." 
18 So I wouldn't say I was disappointed, but I was not surprised either. 
19 
20 
21 
22 Okay. Thank you. 
- Thankyou, 
BY-: 
Q So I guess then do you remember President Trump saying anything about 
23 marching in his speech? 
24 
25 A 
Q Was it marching or walking, I don't know. But yeah. 
But you do remember it?  1 
2 A Yeah. 
Q Okay. And did you plan on marching to the Capitol before going to the 
3 Ellipse? 
4 A No, I didn't. I thought we were just going to go for the rally and just stay 
5 there. 
6 Q Okay. So did you decide to march, in part, because of President Trump's 
7 speech? 
8 
9 
10 A 
Q 
A No. It was my son-in-law. 
Did he march in part because of President Trump's speech? 
You know, I'm not sure why. But, you know, I just remember standing 
11 there watching it. And then he said, "Come on, let's go." 
12 
13 Q And what was your reaction when he said that? 
A Well, I was just, like, "Well, okay." I mean, we were together. 30 
14 just --I --and I said to him, I said, "I want to try to find that group that I want to meet up 
15 with." And he said, "No, come on, let's go." 
16 
17 
18 Real quick, -
BY 
Q One question. Did you think that President Trump was going to march or 
19 be at the Capitol that day? 
20 A Well, I mean, I think he suggested that he was going to do that, but in my 
21 mind I'm thinking, how could he do that? That would be --seems like that would be 
22 dangerous. Like, how could you have enough security around him? 
23 Q Why would it be dangerous --why would it be dangerous for the President 
24 to go to the Capitol on January 6th? 
25 A I mean, just because of so many people, like, it just seems like a mob of  1 people, like, you know, just [inaudible} there would be so many people. 
2 Q So I guess just help us square it then. I mean, you were saying this whole 
3 time that you weren't expecting violence. It seemed almost happy and peaceful up 
4 there. But then you're saying it would be dangerous with this mob of people for the 
5 President to be at the Capitol. I guess, just help us understand that difference. 
6 
7 
8 
9 A Number. Just in terms of number of people, just so many people. 
Q But wasn't he at the Ellipse with the same number of people? 
A Yeah, but there was, like, glass up there, and there was, like, security. 
Q Okay. So in your mind, you didn't think that the President was actually 
10 going to be at the Capitol? 
11 A I just didn't see how he could march along. I don't --I don't know. That 
12 didn't make sense to me. 31 
13 Q Okay. Did your son-in-law think that President Trump was going to join you 
14 all at the Capitol? 
A You know, I don't know. We didn't really talk about that. 
Okay. Thank you. 
Thank you, 
BY-15 
16 
17 
18 
19 Q And in terms of what President Trump said, do you remember a line --and I 
20 want to quote it --"And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country 
21 anymore"? 
22 
23 A 
Q Boy, I don't remember hearing that. 
Do you remember general language about fighting or taking back our 
24 country, stuff like that? 
25 A I mean, I'm sure he said take --we need to take back our country. I mean,  1 that sounds like something he would say. I don't specifically, like, remember that, 
2 but --to me, I don't know, when he says to fight, to take back the country, I didn't 
3 think --I didn't think that he meant, like, get your weapons out and, like, you know, 
4 violently fight for the country. That's not how I took it. 
5 
6 
7 
8 Q But so you do remember general language about fighting? 
A Probably. Possibly. I just don't specifically remember. 
Q Okay. So how did you take it then? 
A Well, to me, to do what he was asking was more, like, to do what we were 
9 doing, like, be part of a rally, like, get involved in, like, that way. 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 Q Okay. 
A That's how you --
Q I'm sorry. 
A --make a change. 
Q Did you notice a change in the crowd when he gave --when he was talking 
15 about fighting? 32 
16 A I mostly noticed a change in the crowd when they said that Congress is going 
17 to vote. That's when I noticed a change in the crowd. 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 Q Who is "they" said this? When President Trump said it or --
A No. Just like people saying it in, like, the area we were in. 
Q So you mean other rally attendees? 
A Yes. 
Q So if other rally attendees said something about Congress is going to vote, 
23 then you noticed a change in the crowd? 
24 
25 A Yes. 
Q Did you think that had anything to do with people talking about stopping the  33 
1 steal? 
2 A I don't know. I mean, it was just, like, there became a sense of urgency, 
3 like, we need to go to the Capitol. 
4 And for me, I don't know what they were thinking. I don't know if they were --I 
5 mean, I don't know. 
6 For me, I just thought, "Oh, we should go there and just be there." I don't know 
7 what anyone else was thinking. 
8 Q Okay. So you did notice a change then, so it made an impression. And 
9 why did you think it was important to be with them at the Capitol? 
10 A I felt like Congress didn't know anyone was out there. I felt like, if people 
11 were on, you know, in front of the Capitol, that they would, like, just see the number of 
12 people that were concerned. 
13 Q And what would, in your mind --or what did you hope would happen once 
14 Congress knew? 
15 A I hoped that they would say, "Oh, there's a lot of people out there that are 
16 concerned about this election." 
17 
18 Q 
A And what did you think that would do? 
So what I understood is that there was supposed to be discussion or 
19 something for each State, like, a 2-hour discussion, and I was hoping they would actually 
20 do that. If they saw that there were people that are --were concerned about it, that 
21 they might have some sense of concern as well. 
22 Q Were you aware before January 6th, or had you heard of specific Members 
23 of Congress who had already announced that they were going to challenge specific 
24 States? 
25 A Yes.  34 
1 Q Okay. So why did you think Congress was not aware of your concerns? 
2 A Because I think --I look back and I think I was probably a little naive about 
3 that. Of course they knew people were there. But I don't know why I thought they 
4 didn't know we were there. 
5 I know there was, like, one or two Senators, I think it was, that were going to bring 
6 up a discussion of the election. But I just thought, well, they could --you know, it's 
7 maybe not enough people to, like, make any kind of difference. I don't know.  35 
1 
2 [12:05 p.m.] 
3 BY 
Q I just want to step in real quick. 
By difference, do you mean delay the vote, certifying the election? 4 
5 
6 A No, I don't mean delay the vote. I mean, like, discussion, they were --said 
7 they were going to have a discussion of each State that was not --well, I guess I mean 
8 there were States that were bringing concerns or alternate electors or something. 
9 Q Look, you're talking about 2 hours of discussion. What does that 2 hours of 
10 discussion lead to, right? Are they just discussing and then President Biden's President 
11 or is there a discussion that leads to something different? I mean, it just seems kind of 
12 obvious. So we're just trying to get that. That's all. 
13 A Well, I mean, I guess when you say it like that, I guess it does sound like a 
14 delay. But that in my mind was not about a delay. It was just about having a 
15 discussion when about should there be --why did these States send alternate electors? 
16 Like it seems like there should --they should talk about that. 
17 BY-: 
18 
19 
20 
21 Q 
A 
Q 
A Was it your understanding that some States had sent alternate electors? 
Yes. 
Where did you hear that? 
I was --I think I might have heard that on YouTube, because I think I was 
22 watching a lot of YouTube back then. 
23 Q Okay. And did --so you --were you hoping then that the discussion would 
24 prevent alternate electors from their votes being certified? Sorry. Let me rephrase 
25 that to be clear. Was it your hope that, with the 2 hours of discussion, Congress would  1 not certify these alternate electors? 
2 A Okay. You know, I feel like if the electors that were sent were legitimate, 
3 that would be fine by me. But if there were States that sent alternate electors, then 
4 they obviously were concerned enough to send alternate electors. So --
5 
6 Q BY 
I guess my question is: Was it your understanding that actual State 
7 legislatures sent alternate electors? 
Actually, I don't know who sends them. 
What were you watching on YouTube? 
Let's see. You mean specific channels? 36 
8 
9 
10 
11 A 
Q 
A 
Q So you're --I mean, alternate electors seems oddly specific. So what were 
12 you watching on YouTube to learn about alternate electors? 
13 A There were a few channels that would come up. I think that Great Harvest 
14 Ministries that I was talking about was talking about that. 
15 Q All right. What were the other channels? You said there were a few 
16 channels. What other channels were you watching? 
17 A There was one, like, BCP, Black Conservative Patriot or something. I mean, 
18 I'd have to look it up, I guess, to remember if there were others. 
19 
20 
21 Q Okay. Thanks. 
BY-: 
Do you remember what the channel said about what should be done about 
22 these alternate electors? 
23 A What I understood is that they have to, like, if --how does this go? If they 
24 were --if there was a discussion and a --
25 Q Well, I could rephrase and just be a little stronger, more clear about my  37 
1 question. Were these YouTube channels talking about preventing or stopping Congress 
2 from certifying these alternate electors? 
3 
4 A 
Q Not that I remember. 
So you don't remember what the hoped-for outcome was about these 
5 alternate electors? Like you knew they existed. You thought they were a problem. 
6 What would the resolution be? 
7 A So if for some reason --and I didn't think it would happen that day, like, that 
8 they would just say, Oh, we're going to switch electors, like that. I didn't thing that 
9 could happen because that --that just wouldn't happen. 
10 But I guess you have to have alternate electors already chosen for if there was 
11 some problem with the vote. Like, if at some point, they said, Okay, there's a problem 
12 with the vote than were no alternate electors, then nothing could --like, it would just say 
13 with the original electors or something. I don't know. I guess I don't know all --I guess 
14 I don't know all this very well. 
15 Q It's okay. But the way you described it, it is a complicated process. The 
16 way you described it, it sounds like at minimum you were hoping for a delay but, even 
17 more than that, that some other group of electors would be certified, not the Biden 
18 electors. Is that a correct summary? 
19 A I guess in simple terms, yeah. 
BY 
Q I'll make it even more simple just to make sure we put a pin in this. 20 
21 
22 So let's throw electors out of the window. Was it your thought that after 
23 January, what, 20th, after the inauguration, that President Trump would still be 
24 President? 
25 A No. I mean, it was obviously too late by then.  38 
1 Q I swear we're not trying to trip you up or anything like that. I guess we're 
2 just trying to understand: What are these discussions for? You said you were hoping 
3 there would be 2 hours of discussion. You were hoping there would be alternate 
4 electors. 
5 
6 
7 Mr. Tolman. If I could just interject. 
Please, please, Mr. Tolman. 
Mr. Tolman. So one of the unique things about Janet compared to maybe just a 
8 lot of them --and you all have obviously done so many of these interviews with people 
9 that were just --Janet --Janet was following her son-in-law. And I don't think she had 
10 the same sort of passions and fires and intentions for what it seems like a lot did when 
11 they went to the Capitol and went inside the Capitol. 
12 And as I've gotten to know her, she's very much wanted something to be clearly 
13 fair, and didn't seem to be the person who cared one way or the other about the result. 
14 And, so, a lot of it doesn't make sense to those of us that are on the outside, looking at, 
15 you know, the fact that you're there, you're in D.C., you go into the Capitol. She's a little 
16 bit different than some and especially, you know, her son-in-law. 
17 And so it's sometimes very kind of difficult when you get into conversations with 
18 Janet, but maybe I can ask a couple of questions. 
19 While you were there, Janet, I know you indicated that you didn't 
20 think --you thought it was too late for any change in, you know, who's President or not. 
21 But while you were there, you were observing folks that seemed to feel very differently, 
22 that they thought there could be a change immediately based on what you started to 
23 hear while you were there. Is that fair? 
24 Ms. Buhler. Yes. I guess what --what people were really hoping for is that 
25 Mike Pence would be the one that would stop or, like, kind of ask for that reevaluation of  39 
1 the of the State's question. 
2 BY 
3 Q Stop the certification, right? Stop the certification. I mean, I'm just trying 
4 to be direct, Ms. Buhler. Stop the certification is what people were saying Vice 
5 President Pence could do, correct? 
6 
7 A 
Q That's what they were saying. 
And when you say people --and, Mr. Tolman, I'm going to piggyback off your 
8 question. This doesn't include you. Is that your testimony here today? It was 
9 everyone else, but it doesn't include you? 
10 
11 
12 A 
Q 
A Well, that was news to me that day that that could happen. 
So you learned the news that day. And now what do you start to think? 
I'm starting to think, well, that's interesting. You know, like, I didn't know 
13 that he could do that and I, guess, he's --I guess he couldn't do that. I don't know. 
14 Q So you didn't know he could do that. You heard others start to say he can 
15 do that. You're not now trying to encourage Vice President Pence to do this? I mean, I 
16 understand you may not come on January 6th with these thoughts, but you learned of it 
17 on January 6th and now we're trying to understand how that impacted your thoughts. 
18 A Well, I had no way to influence Pence at all from --I don't know what you're 
19 saying. I don't really. 
20 
21 
22 
23 Q Let me try to clarify, 
So you mentioned that you wanted Congress to hear you, right? And that's 
24 part of the reason that you marched to the Capitol. As you learned about the possibility 
25 that Mike Pence or --sorry --Vice President Pence could stop the certification of the vote,  40 
1 did you also want him to hear your voice? 
2 A I mean, by the time that that --people were talking about that, we were 
3 already there. And he was already --so this is the thing is that day, like, there --you 
4 couldn't get any cell service because there was so many --I don't know. I guess it was 
5 overwhelmed or something like that. So all the news that we had was just, like, 
6 circulating, people talking to each other. 
7 So I don't know when it was, that Pence was supposed to certify and then I'm 
8 hearing, Well, he's --He's probably going to extend it back to the States for discussions or 
9 something like that. Like I --I don't know what I --I wasn't hoping for anything in 
10 regards to Pence because it's just new information. I didn't know what to think about it. 
11 
12 Q 
A All right. But was that new information before you went to the Capitol? 
No. It was information that I got when I was there, standing in the crowd 
13 and people started talking about it. 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Sorry. When you were standing in the Ellipse crowd? 
No. 
The crowd at the Capitol. 
Yes. 
That's the first time that you learned that they were --that you had heard 
19 about the possibility of Vice President Pence --
20 
21 
22 
23 A 
Q Yes. 
--stopping anything. Okay. 
So what were you then hoping to accomplish by entering the Capitol? 
A So this woman came up to the side of us, and she, says, Pence folded. So it 
24 was kind of, like, okay. Well, in my mind I was thinking, Well, that's it, you know. 
25 Well, my son-in-law looks at me, and he says, I want to go in.  41 
1 And I was kind of, like --like, first of all, it caught me off guard. Second of all, my 
2 phone's not working. I have no idea where I am. 
3 
4 
5 And so, he said, Hang onto my backpack. I don't want you to get lost. 
Q 
A What were --what was going on around you at this point? 
Okay. So there were already people going in. There were --there were, I 
6 guess, Capitol Police up on the top of the steps and the, like, people were pushing 
7 forward and the --those --I mean, they were in yellow vests. I just assume they're 
8 Capitol Police. I don't know. But they just, like, like, threw their hands up and then 
9 just walked away. So that's when people started really going forward. 
10 
11 
12 
13 bit. And that's when my son-in-law said, I want to go in. 
BY 
Q I'm sorry, ma'am. I just want to backtrack. I just want to backtrack a little 
14 I'm so sorry, 
15 You mentioned earlier that you didn't know about Vice President Pence until you 
16 got to the Capitol. I want to read an excerpt from President Trump's speech The Ellipse 
17 and see if you recall that. 
18 President Trump said: And he looked at Mike Pence, and I hope Mike is going to 
19 do the right thing. I hope so. I hope so. Because if Mike Pence does the right thing, 
20 we win the election. 
21 Do you recall President Trump talking about Vice President Pence during his 
22 speech at the Ellipse? 
23 
24 A 
Q Yeah, but he didn't say what the right thing is. 
But you knew that there was something, according to former President 
25 Trump, that former Vice President Mike Pence could do that we as in former President  42 
1 Trump could win the election, correct? 
2 A I mean, I don't remember saying that. But that may have been, like, the 
3 first time that I was hearing that something could happen. But it was only after people 
4 around me, telling me things. 
5 Q Got it. So then, when did you leave the Ellipse? Did you leave after 
6 President Trump's speech? 
7 
8 
9 A It wasn't --he wasn't completely finished speaking yet. 
Q I guess why did you start leaving before he was finished speaking? 
A Well, as I said before, my son-in-law hit me on the arms, like, you know, and 
10 he goes, Come on. Let's go. 
11 Q Did he say why let's go? If you all came to see President Trump at a rally, 
12 why are you leaving or why is your son-in-law saying let's go before the speech is over? 
13 
14 A I mean, I don't know what he was thinking at that point. 
Q Okay. That's fair. And you didn't ask why or where you're going? Did 
15 you know you were going the Capitol at that point? 
16 
17 A Well, yes, I did. 
Q So when you all came to D.C. --and I apologize if this question was already 
18 asked. Was the plan for you all to go to the rally at the Ellipse and then go to the Capitol 
19 afterwards? 
20 A My plan was to go to the Ellipse, hear the speech, meet up with that 
21 Christian group, and then do whatever they were going to do. 
22 
23 
24 Q Okay. 
A Which I do think was to go to the Capitol. 
Q Okay. So it was always part of kind of in your plan to go to the Capitol. So 
25 your son-in-law hits you on the arm -- 1 
2 Mr. Tolman. Let me interject. 
Did you know at the time their plan was to go to the Capitol? Did you have a 
3 plan to go to the Capitol? Because -just indicated, okay, then the plan was to 
4 always go to the Capitol. Is that true? Is that accurate? 
5 And just to make sure we're clear, you said the Christian group 
6 that you were following was planning to go to the Capitol. So that's where I --
7 
8 
9 Ms. Buhler. I know. 
--got that characterization from. 
Ms. Buhler. And I think that they were. I think they were. 
Mr. Tolman. Did you know that at the time? 43 
10 
11 Ms. Buhler. I think. I don't know. I was just planning to meet with them and 
12 do what they were going to do. I'm not --I don't think that they were going to meet up 
13 and then stay there at the Ellipse while everyone else went. I mean, I think --I think it 
14 was always to go together in this group. 
15 BY 
16 Q But rather than going with the Christian group, you went just with your 
17 son-in-law? 
18 
19 
20 A Yes, because he didn't want to go with the Christian group. 
Q I guess why didn't he want to go with the Christian group? 
A He, as I've come to know him now, after, he's very impatient. He just didn't 
21 want to try to find them. He had no interest in doing that. He just wanted to do what 
22 he wanted to do. 
23 Q Okay. And so, I guess --1 know - will come back to this. I think 
24 you all had arrived to the Capitol during his last line of questioning. But, I guess, how 
25 did you get there? Did you walk? Did you metro? How did you get to the Capitol?  1 
2 A We walked. 
Q And did you --how did you know how to get there? You just kind of 
3 followed the crowd? 
4 
5 A Following the crowd. 
Q So you walked up on sounds like the west side the Capitol? Because you 
6 said --did you see the inauguration stage as you walked up to the Capitol? 
7 
8 
9 
10 A I mean, there was scaffolding. Is that --
Q Uh-huh. 
A Yeah. 
Q So you saw the scaffolding. And then did you go to the other side of the 
11 Capitol? I think from reading --
12 A Yeah. 
13 
14 
15 Q Okay. You went to the scaffolding side? 
A Yeah. 
Q Okay. And you said you saw individuals, protesters pushing what you 
16 thought were Capitol Police kind of near the top of the terrace area? 
17 
18 A 
Q Pushing them? I guess they must have. I mean, I --
1 mean, I don't want to --I don't want to assume anything. I'll ask you 44 
19 again. All I recall specifically is you saying that Capitol Police kind of just put their hands 
20 up and let people in. Describe how to us how it got to that point? 
21 A Well, I mean, it was getting really noisy. There was a lot of, like, people 
22 were playing music. People were, you know, chanting, like, things like Trump, Trump, 
23 Trump. People were saying things, chanting, like, Stop the Steal, things like that. And 
24 there were some, like, kind of --some guy with this huge horn thing was out there and 
25 just a lot chalking and watching.  45 
And I'm sorry. What was your question? 1 
2 Q I guess my question is: Did you observe any type of pushing and shoving of 
3 Capitol Police from the scaffolding? 
4 A So when I was there, so the --there was scaffolding on the --like if you were 
5 approaching, some scaffolding on the left-hand side. And we were, like, to the left of 
6 that. So I --I mean, I didn't --I didn't see, you know, like, things that I see on the news, 
7 I'm, like, I don't --that's nothing what I saw. 
8 Q Yeah, I don't think we're asking what you saw on the news. I'm just asking: 
9 Did you see anybody pushing and shoving of any sort of Capitol Police when you arrived 
10 at the Capitol? 
11 A I think at the top of the stairs they were kind of pushing against that security 
12 person there. That was my point of view right there. 
13 Q Got it. And I know just from, again, from your docket it looks like you 
14 appeared, or you arrived at the Capitol, what, around --or at least you went into the 
15 Capitol, what, around 2:20-ish? Is that correct? 
16 
17 A 
Q I believe so. 
Okay. So what time did you actually arrive at the Capitol? That's what I'm 
18 trying to understand is the difference in time between when you arrived versus when you 
19 actually went in. 
20 
21 
22 
23 A 
Q 
A 
Q I mean, I know we stood out there for a bit. 
This is just approximate. It doesn't have to be exact, just approximately. 
I don't know, 10 minutes, 15 minutes. 
And then just to put a pin in this before I give this back to-Â· But 
24 you saw the Capitol Police put their hands up, you said, and then people going in? Is 
25 that what you recall?  46 
A Well, that wasn't in, like, into the Capitol. That was, like --
Q Uh-huh. 
A --the people, like, with the vests, like, standing at the top of the steps. 1 
2 
3 
4 Q Okay. So they put their hands up and people walked past them at the top 
5 of the steps? 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 A Yeah. 
Okay. Thank you. 
_, back to you. 
- Thankyou, BY-
Q So I just want to talk about the little bit of time before you went into the 
12 Capitol again. You said that's when you learned about Vice President Pence --
13 
14 
15 
16 A Uh-huh. 
Q --and what he could do? 
A The specifics about it. 
Q Okay. I know read a part of former President Trump's 
17 speech. I wanted to read another line. So former President Trump says: 
18 "States want to revote. The States got defrauded. They were given false 
19 information. They voted on it. Now they want to recertify. They want it back. All 
20 Vice President Pence has to do is send it back to the States to recertify and we become 
21 President and are you the happiest people." 
22 Do you remember hearing that? 
23 A You know, I don't --I don't remember hearing that. And I will say. This 
24 when we were there, we were by the speakers. There was a lot of, like, feedback. It 
25 wasn't like I could clearly hear everything he was saying because it was bouncing around  47 
1 a lot. So at some point I know, like, trying to check my phone and just see, you know. 
2 So I don't know that I was focused, like, paying attention to every single word. 
3 Q Understood. So let's talk about once you get into the Capitol. What did 
4 you do? 
5 A So we walked in. There was someone pointing the direction for us to go. 
6 So, you know, we were just, like, kind of following people, following the crowd. 
Who was pointing? 7 
8 Q 
A Well, someone who looks like they were in authority, someone who looked 
9 like they were Capitol Police, but now they're tell me that didn't happen. So I don't 
10 know what --I don't know who it was but somebody was pointing. 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Do you remember if the person --what the person was wearing? 
They were wearing, like, it looked to me like an official uniform. 
A uniform? So was it green? 
Korean? 
I'm sorry. Green. That was not clear. 
Oh. No, it wasn't green. It was black. 
It was black. And what made you think it was authoritative? 
I mean, I swear I saw, like, a badge on that person. 
A police badge? 
To me, that's what it looked like. 
Do you --did it look like something printed into the jacket or the clothing 
22 versus, like, you know, an FBI holding up a badge? 
23 A You know, I didn't even know, like, that there was a difference. So I did not 
24 pay attention to that. Plus, it was, like, we had to go. Like we couldn't just, like, stop 
25 and -- 1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
8 move on? Were there other people pointing along or just this person? 
Just that one person. 
And, I mean, was it a he or --a male or female? Could you tell? 
It was a he. 
Was he wearing camouflage? 
No. 
Okay. do you have any follow-up on that before I 
9 No. 
10 No? Okay. 
11 BY-
12 Q So then after he points you along, what next? , I'm sorry I interrupted you 
13 before. 48 
14 A So then we just followed the crowd, like, where everyone was going. And 
15 then I started seeing some people that were dressed in green, full camouflage, like, with 
16 helmets and everything. And I --I don't know. It made me feel nervous, because I just 
17 didn't know what to think about that. And I wanted to leave, but we couldn't go back 
18 the way we came because too many people were coming in. So we just had to keep, 
19 like, going forward. 
20 And then I think we ended up, we're in the --where the statues, the statues are, I 
21 guess. So I guess we went down some stairs maybe, and then just kept going and then 
22 we had to go back. I remember going back up the stairs. And it's just, like, such a 
23 maze in there. Like I had no idea, like, how to get out. So it's just, like, we kept 
24 wandering, like, just trying to find. And then we ended up just keep going up because 
25 that was, like, the only way to go.  1 
2 Q Okay. I'll try to break it up sort of piece by piece. 
I think --I think, according to your docket, you were in the rotunda. Do you 
3 remember seeing anything happen in there? 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q No. 
You didn't see any violence, anything like that? 
I didn't, no. 
Do you remember anyone breaking down doors? 
I don't. 
So according to your statement of facts that went along with your guilty 49 
10 plea, it mentions that you observed people breaking down doors in the rotunda, and that 
11 you cheered on the rioters. Do you remember doing that? 
12 A I know that I --I mean, there's video of me, like, clapping and cheering. 
13 have had my car smashed into twice, smashed. I would never --I would never cheer for 
14 destruction of property like that. 
15 
16 Q 
A So what were you cheering? 
I was cheering --there was something someone said, and I remember my 
17 son-in-law said something. But in my mind, someone said something that I agreed with. 
18 I couldn't tell you what it was at this point. I don't remember. But I do not --I do not 
19 cheer for destruction of property. I just don't. 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 Q 
A 
Q 
A Did you see any destruction of property when you were walking through? 
No. 
No? 
No. Like things were --I saw things that were absolutely, like --
Mr. Tolman. Janet, let me interrupt. 
You recall indicating that you saw broken glass.  1 
2 
3 Ms. Buhler. Right. But I didn't see it being broken. 
- I'm sorry if I wasn't clear enough. 
Mr. Tolman. You saw evidence of destruction, but you didn't see who had 50 
4 actually done it? 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 Ms. Benson. That's right. That's correct. 
Q 
A 
Q 
A BY-: 
So just to put it on the record, did you see anybody destroying property? 
No. 
But you did see property that was destroyed around you. 
Evidence of, like, there were some glass here and there or that's --that's 
11 mainly what I saw. 
12 Q And who do you --
13 - real quick. +.just want to read. 
14 And, Ms. Buhler, this part's not meant to trip you up. 
15 Mr. Tolman, I just want to make sure this is clear. 
16 I just want to read straight from your statement of facts because this is kind of 
17 what we're working our way through pretty, we thought, succinctly. 
18 But your statement of facts says: Buhler and Harden then stood outside the 
19 rotunda and observed rioters violently break into the east rotunda doors, which were 
20 being manned by U.S. Capitol Police officers. 
21 
22 
23 Simple question: Do you not remember this? 
Ms. Buhler. I do not remember that. 
Mr. Tolman, I just want to, I guess, put it out there. Like, we're 
24 reading straight from the statement of facts. 
25 Mr. Tolman. I understand. Let me have a second. It's been a long time for,  51 
1 you know, a lot of questions. Let me have a minute with her. 
2 We'll go off the record at 12:35 and go back on at 12:40? Is that 
3 fair? 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 Mr. Tolman. That sounds good. Thank you. 
All right. We'll come back on at 12:40 p.m. 
[Discussion off the record.] 
We'll go back on the record at 12:41 p.m. 
Mr. Tolman. Janet, just to clarify in regards to the question that 
9 had talked to you about, he read from your statement. Everything that is in that 
10 statement that you signed, you agree those are the facts when you entered into 
11 that --when you signed that statement that he's reading from, correct? 
12 
13 Ms. Buhler. Yes. 
Mr. Tolman. And this is --it's been some time and you're relying on your 
14 memory to best of your ability, and I think everything understands that. But I think his 
15 specific question was there was an instant --and,_, you can follow up obviously on 
16 this --but there were instances where you saw rioters, and there are instances where you 
17 observed broken and damaged property in that time that you were at the Capitol, 
18 correct? 
19 
20 
21 Ms. Buhler. Yes. 
Mr. Tolman. And, , if you'd like to follow up, please. 
No, I think --I think we're good. You clarified it with your 
22 opening kind of explanation. I'm good. I'll turn it over to-
23 
24 
25 Mr. Tolman. Okay. Thank you. 
- Thank you for that clarification. 
BY- 1 Q So beyond the rotunda, you mentioned going up some stairs. Do you 
2 remember where you ended up? 
3 A No. I just --I just --I don't know that building at all. So I don't know --I 
4 don't know. 
5 
6 
7 Q Okay. You don't remember. 
Do you remember seeing the Senate Chamber? 
A I saw, yeah, some doors, like, wooden, wooden doors and, like, a lot of 52 
8 people were going over there. So I went to see what they were looking at. And it was, 
9 like, the upper, what do you call that thing, gallery? Gallery? 
10 
11 
12 
13 Q And what did you do when you saw that? 
A I think I stepped over the threshold and just took a look around the room. 
Q Okay. And then what? 
A And then my son-in-law wanted to take a picture. So I waited for him to 
14 take a picture. And then we just turned around. 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 Q And did you go anywhere else or --
Mr. Tolman. And, Janet, do you recall mention of a place called the crypt? 
Ms. Buhler. The crypt? Isn't that downstairs? 
Mr. Tolman. Correct. Correct. 
Ms. Buhler. Yeah. 
Mr. Tolman. And there was video that you saw that you were in the crypt for at 
21 least at some point during the time that you were in there? 
22 Ms. Buhler. Yeah, so that's where the statues are, right? Like there's a bust of 
23 Lincoln in there? Is that right? Is that the place, the right place? 
24 
25 - That is correct. 
Ms. Buhler. Okay.  1 
2

9 Thank you. 
BY-
Q So I guess did you leave the Capitol after seeing the Senate Chamber? 
A To the best of my knowledge that I remember? 
Q That's all we can ask. Is that a yes? 
A Yes. Sorry. Yes. 
Q Thank you. 
Do you remember why you left? 
A Well, I mean, I mean, no, just that, like I said, I wanted --I wanted to leave 
10 and we just finally found our way out. 
Q Did your stepson want to leave, too? 
A I think so at that point, yes. 
Q So since all this happened, looking back on January 6th --
_, really quickly. 
I'm so sorry. 
BY 53

12

14 
15 
16 
17 
18 Q Do you recall former President Trump posting a video, telling everyone to go 
19 home that day on January 6th? 
20 
21 
22 
23 A 
Q 
A I didn't see that until much later. 
Do you recall anyone talking about it as you were leaving the Capitol? 
No. 
Q Okay. So President --former President Trump had no bearing on your 
24 decision to leave the Capitol that day? 
25 A No. Like I said, my phone --well, maybe --maybe my phone was working  54 
1 at that point. I don't remember. But I don't think I would have had any way to see. 
2 And we didn't really talk to anyone in the Capitol. Like we didn't stop and have 
3 conversations at all. So --
4 Q I guess what's important for us to understand in this investigation, which is 
5 probably different, I don't know, maybe than what DOJ is doing is: Why did you end up 
6 leaving? I guess that's what we need to figure out. Why did you actually end up 
7 leaving the Capitol after 30 or so minutes inside? 
8 A I mean, there was, like, nothing to do, nothing to --I mean, there was just 
9 nothing going on. It was just, like, all these people were coming in. And I don't know. 
10 I mean, there was just no reason. 
11 Thank you. 
12 
13 
14 Q 
A Did you feel fearful at all? 
I don't feel like that I was fearful. There were just --I mean, I didn't see 
15 any, like, weapons or anything, like, that I would have --it's just like there seemed to be, 
16 like, groups of people, like, wearing, like, similar outfits where I was just, like, I don't know 
17 what these groups are doing. And so, I was a little kind of --I didn't know. I didn't 
18 know what their purpose was. So that was kind of my --especially the people in green, 
19 like the people dressed in, like, Army stuff, like, I just didn't know. I don't know. 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 Q Fair to say they made you a little uncomfortable? 
A Yeah. 
Q Okay. Thank you. 
After January 6th, for the record, were you arrested for entering the Capitol? 
A During the Capitol? 
Q Were you arrested later for entering the Capitol?  1 
2 
3 Mr. Tolman. We self-surrendered to -Â­
Okay. 
Mr. Tolman. Yeah, we --she reached out to me. I reached out to the 55 
4 prosecutor, because her son-in-law had been arrested. And so, immediately after that, 
5 she sought my help. And then we reached out and --to the government. 
6 - Great. I think I can state for the record, and please tell me if this is 
7 incorrect, but you were eventually charged and you did enter a guilty plea, correct? 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 Ms. Buhler. Yes. 
And what is the current status of the case? 
Ms. Buhler. Brett. 
Mr. Tolman. So we're waiting for sentencing which will happen in June. 
Thank you, Mr. Tolman. 
BY 
Q So the last couple of questions are more about how you feel, looking back. 
15 So what are your thoughts about January 6th now? 
16 A Well, it was a huge mistake for me to even go. Wish I hadn't gone. I --I 
17 mean, I don't know how much you want me to say, how --
18 
19 Q 
A Whatever you think you need to say. 
It's --I mean, there's been a personal cost, as well as, like, just when I look 
20 at, like, what has happened. Like I didn't --I didn't feel like the full impact of what it 
21 really was at the time when I went in. I don't --you know, I just feel awful that it was, 
22 like, this --this turned into this horrible, like, you know, insurrection because I had no 
23 intention of, you know, doing any violence. Or, you know, I feel like I was just really 
24 naive about what I thought could happen that day, or that I could really even make a 
25 difference at all because as far as just even having my, you know, my presence, you know,  56 
1 to Congress known. 
2 I mean, I look back. And I think, of course, they knew people were there, but at 
3 the time --I don't know. I just --you know, if I could take it back, I would take it back. 
4 I, you know, I never want to be in that situation again. I don't plan on even being 
5 involved in politics. They're not my world at all. And I don't even know why I got 
6 involved. Like, I can't personally change anything or do anything, even, like, I --and as 
7 far as, like, I need to just think for myself. 
8 Like with my son-in-law, I trusted him as, you know, he's a former police officer. 
9 I --I trusted his, like, knowledge about --I just assumed he would --he would know it 
10 would be okay to go in, because he just acted like it was totally fine. 
11 And I should have just been, I don't know. I just --I just beat myself up every day 
12 about it. It's just dumb, stupid. 
13 Q Understood. So fair to say that you don't believe that marching to the 
14 Capitol was the most effective way to use your political voice? 
15 A It was, like, no, I should have --I should have just gone --if I was going to go, 
16 I should have just gone to the Ellipse and then I should have just, like, left. 
17 -
18 I have a follow-up,_ 
19 I guess do you now, more than a year from January 6th, acknowledge there's a 
20 difference between, you know, marching to the Capitol and protesting versus what 
21 actually happened on January 6th? 
22 
23 Ms. Buhler. Can you rephrase that? 
Yeah. Do you think there's a difference between protesting and 
24 then what actually happened on January 6th? 
25 Ms. Buhler. Yeah, I think that it ended up, like, just going too far. Like it ended  57 
1 up not being, like, you know, like a peaceful protest. It ended up being, like, way more 
2 than that. And I'm just so sorry that I was involved in it because that's not what I had 
3 envisioned, or even wanted to be part of at all. 
4 BY 
5 Q I heard you say the word "insurrection." Would you say there's a 
6 difference between --would you characterize January 6th, looking back on it, along the 
7 
8 lines of an insurrection, or closer to the peaceful protest mentioned? 
A So, I mean, "insurrection" is the word that the media uses a lot. But it 
9 definitely was more --it wasn't a peaceful protest. I wouldn't say that at all. So I don't 
10 know, I guess, the definition of the word. I don't --I don't know, I guess. 
11 Q But it's --you're just saying that on the scale, if we're putting up peaceful 
12 protest, insurrection, it's not a peaceful protest. You're not --
13 
14 A 
Q No. 
You don't know the legal definition of insurrection, but it certainly was not a 
15 peaceful protest. 
16 
17 A 
Q Right. 
Okay. So, in general, have your feelings about President Trump or towards 
18 President Trump changed since last January 6th? 
19 A I mean, I guess just because of the --like, I wasn't a, like, a die hard, you 
20 know, Trump supporter before. I mean, I'm just, like, you know, a Republican. And, I 
21 mean, I reluctantly voted for him in 2016 because I had no idea who he was. 
22 But now I just, like, I don't --I don't look at him like --so I guess in a way, my 
23 feelings have changed because I think that, I mean, I just --1 just can't figure out what's 
24 going on at all. So I don't know. I just, yeah, I --I don't know --I mean, obviously, I 
25 voted for him in 2020, but I don't know if I'd vote for him again. I don't know. I don't  58 
1 know if I'd vote for him again. 
2 Q That's okay. Just one last thing. Do you still think the election was 
3 stolen? 
4 A You know, I just --I don't know if "stolen" the right word. I just --I just feel 
5 like there's some maybe problems in every election. I don't know that it was stolen. 
6 think that obviously every State needs to clean up their voter rolls and things like that. 
7 And I just think it was just with COVID and everything, it was hard to have, like a real 
8 election with, you know, people being, you know, not wanting to get out and vote or 
9 whatever. 
10 But I just I'm just for fair elections. I don't --you know, whoever is elected fairly, 
11 that's fine with me. 
12 
13 Mr. Tolman. Just to clarify, -
He indicated do you still feel the election was stolen. Is it fair to say you weren't 
14 sure whether it was stolen or not even before January 6th? 
15 Ms. Buhler. Right. I wasn't. I just wanted --yeah, I just wanted clarification 
16 on some things but, you know, I wouldn't say I thought it was absolutely stolen. 
17 wouldn't say that. I just think there's some questions. 
18 Mr. Tolman. And you had that belief before and after January 6th? 
19 Ms. Buhler. Yeah. 
20 -Okay. 
21 
22 
23 Mr. Tolman. Thank you,_ 
- Thank you, Mr. Tolman. 
So I guess we covered a lot of topics today. Is there anything that we missed 
24 that you want to talk about or that you think is important for us to know? 
25 Ms. Buhler. Me?  59 
- Yes,you. 
Ms. Buhler. Oh, I don't. 1 
2 
3 - I'm sorry. I didn't hear that. And there might be some background 
4 noise. So I apologize if that's my fault.

10 
11 Ms. Buhler. I don't know. 
Brett, is there anything that I need to add to this? 
Mr. Tolman. I don't have anything. 
Appreciate, , appreciate your thoroughness on this. 
Thank you very much. 
, do you have anything before we close out? 
Yeah, Ms. Buhler, I'd like to say thank you for taking the time to 
12 sit with us here. This is a really important investigation for Congress, so we can 
13 understand the causes and effects of January 6th, and talking to individuals who actually 
14 went to the rally at the Ellipse and then going into the Capitol is an important part of that 
15 investigation. So we really appreciate you taking the time and answering some of our 
16 difficult questions here today. It is really helpful for the committee. So I just wanted 
17 to put that out there for you. 
18 Ms. Buhler. Yeah, I'm sorry I didn't always understand your questions. So I'm 
19 sorry if I --
20 That is probably more of an effect of us as the question askers 
21 than it is about you. 
22 Mr. Tolman. Also, you guys were fine and Janet is a very literal person, and so, I 
23 tried to know how she responds. 
24 I definitely did want to mention to you-all just a couple of things that might be 
25 helpful. Janet suffered some incredible consequences as a result of this. Before she  60 
1 even, you know, had any sort of interaction with the government, her employer, she was 
2 one of --a renowned professor of fashion. They fired her because of it. They had a 
3 granddaughter that was --that tragically died the last several months from a horrific auto 
4 accident. She's, you know, she's received threats and she gets --you know, she's been 
5 ostracized in a lot of her community. She's trying to build her business back. And, you 
6 know, so, it's real on her side as well. 
7 And she was looking forward to sitting down with you all to try to be able to tell a 
8 lot more of the story, because you don't always get to do that in the criminal case. 
9 So thank you very much. 
10 Thank you. 
11 And we definitely can appreciate and empathize with everything that has 
12 happened post January 6th. 
13 But, again, I can't emphasize enough, like Mr. Tolman just said, how important it is 
14 for us to hear directly from you all, because it's different when we're talking to you than 
15 when we're just reading, you know, the criminal docket and those filings. So thank you 
16 for taking the time. 
17 And unless - has anything, I think we're good to go off the record. 
18 Yeah, we can. 
19 Thank you all again. 
20 And if there's anything else, Mr. Tolman or Ms. Buhler, that you may have for us, 
21 please let us know. 
22 
23 Mr. Tolman. Yes. Will do. 
Sorry for your loss, Ms. Buhler. Thank you for taking the time to talk 
24 to us today. 
25 Mr. Tolman. Thank you both. Appreciate it.  61
