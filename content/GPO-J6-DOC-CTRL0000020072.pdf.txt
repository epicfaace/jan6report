Exactly. Thank you 
Tue, Jan 12, 7:06 AM 
So happy that you will continue as 
Senate President. Congratulations! 
We have a lot of work to do! 
Thanks Jack. Agree and trying to 
navigate all this crazy stuff is 
making it more challenging. Did we 
really volunteer for all this? :) 
Agreed Probably insane to want to do this 
but having logical leadership has 
never been more critical. 
Tue, Jan 26, 8:02 AM 
Morning Jack. I'm on the morning 
report zoom with Luige and 
leadership . I can call about 9 am 
when done 
I have a phone meeting from 
8~3_0-9:3_0 and a web meeting that 
starts at 10.  Karen > 
Ok. We'll figure it out. How you 
holding up ? BTW if I haven't told 
you before, I really appreciate you 
Tue, Jan 26, 11:21 AM 
Let me know when you are free for 
call 
Hi. I'm open for a while now if that 
works 
Is it ok with you if Warren Petersen 
is in on call ?

Maricopa County board chairman 
@jacksellers sent senators a photo 
of pallets of ballots loaded on a truck 
and a letter asking where the county 
is supposed to drop them off. 
Despite subpoenas, the Senate isn't 
sure what to do with 2.1 million 
ballots it demanded.

Wondering if you really did send this 
out today ? I am greeting phones 
calls from every media outlet 
wanting comment and I thought we 
had resolved this issue. Please tell 
me you didn't do this .... 
In a meeting. I will call you in a few. 
Sat, Mar 6, 8:09 PM 
First feedback, I'm told we never 
shred ballots. They are going to 
review security footage around 
MCTEC. 
Thanks. Just thought I'd give you 
heads up to try and get ahead of it 
It's all over social media  Karen > 
The ballots are currently still in the 
vault at MCTEC under camera 
security. The Treasurer is installing 
cameras in his vault in preparation 
for the move. Of course when they 
are moved it will be with full security 
surveillance . 
Can you get someone to push back 
on this crazy stuff ? 
I was so sorry to see the presser on 
Hickman ranch today. My heart is 
broken for them. I pray there was no 
fowl play involved 
They lost over 160,000 chickens. 
Fortunately no serious human 
injuries. As you know, the family is 
very dedicated to our community .  Karen >

I understand you are having an exec 
session this morning I know you all 
are emphatic about not letting the 
hand count audit be done at your 
facilities but was hoping I could ask 
one more time if you would allow the 
auditors to perform their work on 
the machines at the facilities. 
Could you bring it up in the exec 
meeting and let me know if that 
would be possible ? Thanks. 
Senate President Karen Fann 
I will bring it up and let you know. I 
know you & I are so anxious to be 
done with this. 
The exec session is this afternoon .  Thanks very much. Yes I am very 
anxious to have this done and 
behind us. I hate all this 
divisiveness We are too good 
fiends for this 
Tue, Apr 13, 6:35 PM 
I bought your question up in exec 
today. We got a very detailed 
response about efforts to comply 
with the subpoena. A letter is being 
prepared to bring you up to date on 
where things stand. It should be 
delivered before the end of the 
week. Hope that helps.
