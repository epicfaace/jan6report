If you just need a WinRed link for the JF A, I can provide that. Or if people want to give directly to RNC legal 
proceedings fund, they can contact RNC. We don't directly raise to the DJT recount fund.

There is no specific name for the recount fund. It's just a segregated restricted account help by the campaign. 
Not sure what Dan Coates has to do with anything.

Subject: RE: [EXTERNAL]Legal defense fund 
Bottom line is that some people here are concerned that the $ given for helping the president is going to support the 
Senate runoff. For instance, Dan Coates, who I am told is the Director for the Trump campaign has announced that he is 
working SOLELY for the Senate nmoff --so is unavailable to assist in the recount efforts. 
We just need to have the link for the call center to be able to give to people calling in. That's what I'm asking for -
whichever one you want them to use. That's what they need.

** EXTERNAL EMAIL MESSAGE ** 
The campaign has a recount fund and RNC has a legal proceedings fund. There is fundraising occurring through the JFA. 
In addition POTUS established a Leadership PAC on Monday night that has been added to the JF A.
