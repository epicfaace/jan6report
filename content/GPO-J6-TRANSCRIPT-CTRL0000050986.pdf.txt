2 - So we are on the record at 3:01 p.m., and, as you just heard, this is 
3 now being recorded 
4 Good afternoon. This is the transcribed interview of Ms. Carla --and, actually, 
5 can you pronounce your last name for me? I want to make sure I get it right. 
6 
7 Ms. Krzywicki. It's "Krzywicki." 
- Krzywicki. Okay. 
8 This is a transcribed interview of Ms. Carla Krzywicki, conducted by the House 
9 Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol 
10 pursuant to House Resolution 503. 
11 At this time, I'd ask the witness to please state your full name and then spell your 
12 last name for the record. 
13 Ms. Krzywicki. Carla Jean Krzywicki, and my last name is spelled K-r-z-y-w-i-c-k-i. 
14 - Thank you. 
15 And this will be a staff-led interview. Members of the committee may join at 
16 some point and ask a question. I don't really expect that to happen, but it's possible. 
17 And they may also choose to ask questions. 
18 Speaking, as I introduced myself earlier, is- investigative counsel with 3 
19 the select committee. And then also in the room today is also investigative 
20 counsel. 
21 And then, at this time, counsel, could you please state your name for the record? 
22 
23 
24 Ms. Shaner. Heather Shaner. 
- Thankyou. 
So, Carla, there is an official reporter transcribing this interview. Please wait 
25 until I finish my questions before you start your response, and then I'll also try to wait  4 
1 until you finish your answer before I start my next question. Because it's obviously hard 
2 to record two people talking at the same time, so we'll try to be nice to Nicole and Katy 
3 today. 
4 And then, also, relatedly, they can't record nonverbal responses, so just make sure 
5 you use "yes" or "no" instead of, like, a head shake or a nod. Does that make sense? 
6 
7 
8 Ms. Krzywicki. Yes. 
- Okay. Great. 
And then we ask that you provide complete answers just to the best of your 
9 recollection. If the question's not clear, ask me to rephrase it, or you could ask for 
10 clarification. And then, if you don't know the answer, that's totally fine. Just say, I 
11 don't know. 
12 Ms. Krzywicki. Okay. 
13 - And then I want to just go through kind of a few housekeeping 
14 matters and, sort of, ground rules. 
15 So, first, I just want to make sure you understand that this is a voluntary interview. 
16 If at any time you'd like to stop speaking with us, that's your choice. 
17 Similarly, at any point if you need to discuss something with your attorney in 
18 private, just let us know, and we'll be happy to take a break that so you can have that 
19 conversation with Ms. Shaner. 
20 Does that make sense? 
21 
22 Ms. Krzywicki. Yes. 
- Okay. Great. 
23 And then, second, this interview is not under oath, but because you're speaking to 
24 congressional investigators, you are obligated under Federal law to tell the truth, the 
25 same as if you were speaking with FBI or DOJ.  1 And so it's deliberately unlawful to provide false information to Congress for this 
2 interview. Providing false information could result in criminal penalties for false 
3 statements. 
4 Does that make sense? 
5 
6 
7 Ms. Krzywicki. Yes. 
Okay. 
Third, you are not obligated to keep the fact of this interview or what we discuss 5 
8 confidential. You're free to tell whomever you may wish that you met with us, and then 
9 that includes a prosecutor or your judge, or you could tell nobody at all. So that's totally 
10 your decision. 
11 And then, fourth, I just want to make sure that you understand that the select 
12 committee is separate and independent from the Department of Justice. We have no 
13 involvement with prosecutions, and the DOJ is really not a partner of the select 
14 committee in this investigation. 
15 The select committee's not a party to your criminal case and is not agreeing to 
16 submit anything on your behalf to the judge, nor can we make any representation 
17 whether, if you tell the judge that you met us, that the judge will be more favorable to 
18 you during your sentencing. 
19 Does that make sense? 
20 Ms. Krzywicki. Yes. 
21 - Okay. 
22 And then, fifth, we've agreed with your attorney that we're not going to share 
23 what you've said with the DOJ prior to your sentencing, but there are a couple possible 
24 exceptions that we should note just quickly. 
25 If you told us about evidence of a crime that we thought law enforcement was  6 
1 unaware of, then that might trigger an obligation to share that information with DOJ. 
2 Or if we have reason to believe that you told us something that wasn't true during this 
3 interview, same thing. 
4 So as long as we stay away from those things, then we're good today. Does that 
5 make sense? 
6 Ms. Krzywicki. Yes. 
7 - Okay. 
8 Also, I'll just add that, if you tell the judge that you met us, please understand that 
9 that might prompt questions from the judge about what you said and whether it's 
10 consistent with your prior statements and acceptance of responsibility, and if the judge 
11 starts asking questions, we may be asked to respond and divulge what you said during 
12 this interview. So just a final, kind of, related note. 
13 And then just as we go through today, I mean, hopefully we can get you out of 
14 here pretty quickly, but we might go for an hour or two. So if you need a break at some 
15 point, feel free to just let me know, and we can take that kind of break. Or, like I said, if 
16 you need to talk to Ms. Shaner for anything, just let us know. 
17 Ms. Krzywicki. Okay. 
18 - Does that all sound good? 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 Ms. Krzywicki. Yes. 
- Okay. Great. 
EXAMINATION 
Q Then let's just start with some, sort of, background questions. Can you tell 
24 me where you are from? 
25 A Canterbury, Connecticut.  1 
2 
3 
4 Q Okay. And how long have you lived there? 
A I lived there for about 19 years. 
Q Okay. And so that's all of your life, pretty much? 
A Pretty much. And then I moved to Bozrah, Connecticut, as of last 
5 November. 
6 Q Okay. Great. 
7 And then could you just give us a quick run-through of your educational 
8 background? 
9 A Sure. I went to school in Canterbury for elementary and middle school. 7 
10 And then for high school I went to Norwich Technical High School, where I took electrical. 
11 And then I graduated in 2019, and I started college in 2019. 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 Q Okay. Great. And, then, where are you in college? 
A I go to Three Rivers Community College, and I haven't gotten a degree yet. 
Q Okay. Great. What are you studying there? 
A Psychology. 
Q Awesome. 
And let's see. Do you do any other work other than just schoolwork? 
A 
Q Like, employment? 
Like, a side job or anything like that. 
A No. I'm employed by Wendy's as a manager, and that's the only thing I do. 
Q Okay. Great. 
Okay. Let's kind of go back to 2020, a little bit before the general election, in the, 
23 kind of, October-November timeframe. And I just want to know in general, how would 
24 you describe your level of political engagement at that time? 
25 A I would say I didn't know enough about politics to really pick a side, I would  8 
1 say, so not very well. I wasn't very, like, educated enough to know enough about it. 
2 Q Okay. And was that sort of the same throughout Trump's Presidency the 
3 prior 8 years? Would you say you were politically active or just kind of how you 
4 described? 
5 A I personally would say that I just wasn't educated enough. I grew up in a 
6 conservative household, so I was around that, so I would say I wouldn't really know any 
7 better. 
8 If I were to say, at the time, I thought more conservative. But once I, like, grew 
9 up and got into, like, the real world, I realized I'm not really --I was not --I did not know 
10 enough about politics. 
Q Okay. 11 
12 And then I'll note Ms. Shaner corrected me for the record. That is good. It was 
13 4 years, obviously, not 8. 
14 Okay. Let's talk a little bit about, kind of, at that time, news sources that you 
15 would look to. Did you watch any news on TV? 
16 
17 
18 time? 
19 A 
Q 
A Not really. No. 
Okay. What would you say your main, sort of, sources of news were at that 
At the time, I was still a teenager, so, like, just social media in general, like, 
20 Facebook, lnstagram. 
21 Q Okay. Did you and your mom share a lot of information about news or 
22 politics at that time? 
23 A I was raised in her household, so she --she would watch the news. 
24 wouldn't really pay attention. It would be, like, at dinnertime. That was the only time 
25 if I did see any news. And it was usually the local news. And she would watch FOX  9 
1 News. So that's, in my opinion, not necessarily the best at two sides. So that was --so 
2 sometimes we would talk about, like, what was going on in the world, not necessarily, 
3 like, here in the United States. 
4 Q Uh-huh. Gotcha. Okay. Understood. 
5 
6 time? 
7 
8 
9 
10 And how about using social media to get news? Did you do that around that 
A 
Q 
A 
Q I don't believe so. 
No? Okay. Like, did you use Facebook? 
Around --I used Facebook but not necessarily for, like, news purposes. 
Okay. Gotcha. 
11 I'm going to run through just a couple kinds of sources, common sources of news 
12 through social media that people use, and let me know if you used any of these or if you, 
13 kind of, sought out news about, you know, the election in particular or news in general 
14 from any of these sources. 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 So we talked about Facebook already. How about Reddit? 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q No. 
Okay. How about Twitter? Did you use Twitter? 
I do have Twitter, but I don't use it for news. 
Okay. How about VouTube? 
No. 
No? Okay. And then TikTok? 
I use TikTok, but it's not --it's definitely not for news. 
The algorithm isn't giving you news? 
No. 
Okay.  10 
1 So, then, it sounds like in general --and, sorry, not to belabor the point, 
2 but --there wasn't really any particular source of news that you were looking to, and you 
3 weren't really, kind of, like, on a day-to-day basis actively seeking out news information. 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 A Correct. 
Q Okay. 
Did you follow President Trump on any social media at that time? 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A I think I might've followed him on Facebook in high school, but, I mean -­
I'm sorry, what was that last one? It cut out. I didn't hear you. 
I believe that was all. 
Facebook and? 
Maybe Twitter. 
Q Okay. Gotcha. Sorry, the audio just cut out for a second. I didn't hear 
13 what you had said. 
14 Okay. And then do you remember any, kind of, thoughts you had about his 
15 social media presence or anything? Any particular instances of anything that he said 
16 that stand out in your mind? 
17 A Not really. Just that it seemed very silly, some of the things that he would 
18 say. So he was unfollowed, obviously. 
19 
20 Q Yeah. 
How about right around the general election? Do you remember anything that 
21 President Trump said that sticks out in your mind that he might've said about the 
22 election? 
23 
24 
25 A Not that I can remember. 
Q Okay. 
All right. We can move on from, kind of, the --oh, -do you have a  1 question? 
2 - Besides what President Trump might've said, were your friends 
3 posting things on Facebook related to politics at that time? 
Ms. Krzywicki. Yes, I had friends that would post about politics. 
- Did you pay particular attention to it? 11 
4 
5 
6 Ms. Krzywicki. Not really. It was, like, both sides. It was just a broad range of 
7 all sorts of political things. 
8 - Okay. Thank you. 
9 BY-
10 Q And then I'll just say, you know, we'll have lots of really specific questions, 
11 obviously, going through this interview today. And, really, our intention just to kind of is 
12 to understand your mindset going into that day. None of this is to say that anything was 
13 wrong or right to do, but really we just kind of want your perspective on what brought 
14 you there and your experience. 
15 So I hope you don't take our, you know, pointed questions to mean anything other 
16 than just looking for information. 
17 
18 A 
Q Okay. 
Let's talk a little bit about, kind of, what you thought of the general 
19 election --so that's the election in November --and, kind of, how your feelings were 
20 immediately after. Did you think that the election was stolen from former President 
21 Trump? 
22 
23 A 
Q 
24 that feeling? 
25 A No. 
Okay. You didn't. Did friends or family that you were speaking to have 
Some did.  1 
2 
3 Q Okay. And then how about your mom? 
A I can't speak for her, but possibly. 
Q Or, did you guys have conversations where she said that she thought the 
4 election had been stolen? 
5 A No. We didn't really talk politics because sometimes we didn't really see 
6 eye to eye. So it wasn't something --like, a conversation happened and ended very 
7 shortly. 
8 
9 Q Yeah. Right. Okay. 
Let's see. Were there any sorts of rallies or, kind of, political events that you 
10 attended after the general election? 
11 
12 
13 
14 A I don't believe so. 
Q Okay. 
- Can I just ask, - before we keep going? 
What were those conversations like with your mom? Because I think you 
15 mentioned earlier that you sort of grew up sometimes watching FOX News. Did the 
16 tone of them shift around the 2020 election? 12 
17 Ms. Krzywicki. Kind of. As I grew up, I realized, like, some of the things --like, I 
18 don't agree with, like, a lot of older generations', like, that kind of mindset, if you 
19 understand, like, what I'm getting at. Like, just, like, women's rights, gay rights kind of 
20 things like that where they're more conservative, I'm not. 
21 So it kind of --like, if I, like, say, like, women's right to choose, like, abortion and 
22 stuff like that, like, my mom definitely is pro-life, where I'm, like, pro-choice. And just 
23 conversations like that, it just wasn't worth getting into an argument. 
24 Okay. And did the 2020 election, did you feel that heated that sort 
25 of tension up?  1 
2 
3 Ms. Krzywicki. Somewhat. Not a big difference. 
- Okay. Thank you. 
BY-13 
4 Q So I know we talked about your political activity, kind of, before the general 
5 election. I guess I'll just ask more broadly --I know that's --about specific rallies or 
6 events. But did your political perspective change at all or did you kind of have a 
7 different thought about politics or the politics that were going on after the general 
8 election, or kind of the same as before? 
9 A I would say they somewhat changed just, like, growing up in general, 
10 because I was really young when that had happened --still am. But definitely growing 
11 up and realizing a lot more things, I would say they had changed --
12 Q I think you cut out a little bit at the end. You said "I would say," and then I 
13 didn't hear what you said. 
14 
15 
16 
17 A I would say, yes, they have changed slightly. 
Q Okay. And do you mean after January 6th? I should've been --
A Yes. 
Q --more clear. I was kind of focusing on the time between November to 
18 January 6th. Were you feeling differently after the election? 
19 A Yes. 
20 
21 
22 
23 Q Okay. And how did your, kind of, politics change? 
A I would say I would lean more left now. 
Q Okay. Gotcha. 
Let's see. Let's just talk about, kind of, how you ended up in D.C. and what 
24 brought you there, what factors brought you there. 
25 Can you just tell me generally --you know, it sounds like you weren't too  14 
1 politically involved and weren't upset in general about the outcome of the election. So 
2 what brought you to D.C. on that day? 
3 A So my mom was supposed to go to see the President speak with her older 
4 friends. My mom's older; she's 57 now. And her friend are even older. So they were 
5 going to take, I believe it was a bus trip from Norwich, Connecticut, down to D.C. And 
6 her friends didn't want to sit on the bus trip for that long, being older, so she had asked 
7 me if I would go. 
8 And my mom in 
9 general. So I had said, well, I hope she's not gonna go alone. And so she had asked me 
10 if I would go with her, and I said, "Well, we could watch it on TV," kind of thing. But she 
11 
12 
13 
14 really wanted to go see, since it would be the last time he would speak as President. 
So I ended up going with her to make sure she would be okay. Because in any 
kind --she's been to rallies before. She's rallied her whole life. And she'll -
, so I didn't want that to 
15 happen. So I pretty much just went with her to make sure she'd be okay. 
16 Q Understood. 
17 And what did you think January 6th was going to be like when you were, kind 
18 of --before you were heading down? What did you think the events were going to be 
19 like? 
20 A I thought they'd be, like, just him speaking and it'd be like his typical rallies. 
21 Like, when I was in high school, my mom had taken me to when he speaks at stadiums 
22 and places like that. And it's just, like, the atmosphere is all these people getting along 
23 and cheering him on, listening to him speak. And I thought it would be like that. 
24 
25 Q Okay. Great. 
Sorry, can I pause there?  1 
2 Q BY-
Forgive me if I misheard. So you said you went to rallies of President 
3 Trump earlier with your mom? 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 A When I was in high school. 
Q Okay. So when you were in high school. 
But you said you weren't very politically engaged? 
A No. I was kind of just, like, brought along. 
Q Okay. Did you think you supported President Trump at that time? 
A At the time, yes. 
Q Okay. Thank you. 
BY 15 
10 
11 
12 Q And so when was it that --do you know when it was that your mom decided 
13 to go to the rallies on January 6th? 
14 
15 
16 
17 A I can't --I can't remember. I'm sorry. 
Q Okay. And then how far in advance was it that you decided? 
A I want to say 2 weeks, possibly? 
Q Okay. Gotcha. 
18 Do you know how your mom met the group of people that she was going to go on 
19 the bus with or that you all ended up going on the bus with? 
20 
21 
22 
23 A I believe it was on Facebook. 
Q Okay. And were you a member of that Facebook group? 
A No. 
Q Okay. Did you ever see or did she ever show --did your mom ever show 
24 you the Facebook group? 
25 A No.  16 
Q Okay. 1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 - Did anyone on the bus ever mention what the Facebook group was? 
Ms. Krzywicki. Not that I can remember. 
- Does the name "Turning Point" ring a bell? 
Ms. Krzywicki. No. Sorry. 
- That's okay. Thanks. 
- Okay. So, in general, you knew it was a Facebook group, but you 
8 didn't really know what the group was or, kind of, what the discussion on the Facebook 
9 group was like. 
10 
11 
12 Ms. Krzywicki. Correct. 
- Okay. 
- And then, sorry, one more. Did you guys have to pay for this bus, or 
13 was it paid for by somebody else? 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 Ms. Krzywicki. I think my mom had paid someone. 
- And do you think it was somebody in the Facebook group? 
Ms. Krzywicki. I think so. I'm not entirely sure. 
- Okay. Thank you. BY-
Q And, then, I take it, since you didn't seem particularly interested in the rallies 
20 yourself, you didn't do any promoting of the events of January 6th or any rallies, did you, 
21 like, on social media? 
22 
23 A 
Q No. 
Okay. 
24 Once you decided to go to D.C. for January 6th, then did you start following any 
25 accounts or looking up any news about what January 6th would be like?  1 
2 A Not that I can remember. 
Q Okay. So really it was just kind of a trip to go down with your mom 
3 because she might need somebody to kind of assist her medically. 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 media? 
9 
10 A Correct. And I didn't want her to go by herself. 
Q Okay. BY-
Q Did you have any friends that were talking about January 6th on social 
A Not leading up to it, no. 
Q Okay. So no one else that you know of in the area was planning to go on 
11 this bus? 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 in. A Correct. 
Q And no one posted that they would also be there in D.C.? 
A Not up until --oh, sorry. My battery's low. 
But not up until that. Afterwards, yes, but not leading up to it. 
Q__Okay. 
For your battery, do you want to take a minute to plug it in, just in case? 
A I don't know if my phone will stay --when I get the next warning, I'll plug it 
Q Okay. 
I think that's all I have for now, -BY-17 
20 
21 
22 
23 Q Okay. And, then, I take it the answer is probably "no," but were you aware 
24 of any other buses or groups or, kind of, yeah, groups of folks that were also travelling to 
25 Washington, D.C.?  18 
A Not that I knew of. 
Q Okay. 1 
2 
3 Let's talk about the trip down to D.C. Where did you meet this bus or pick up the 
4 bus? 
5 A In Norwich, Connecticut, on the lot right by the Walmart and Big V. 
6 Q Okay. And then what was the plan for traveling down? You were 
7 just --oh, what day --sorry --what day was that, that you picked up the bus? 
8 
9 A It was early, early in the morning on January 6th. 
Q Okay. And so can you tell me just kind of what you remember of the plan 
10 for that day, up to getting to D.C.? 
11 A I believe it was that we were going to get the bus super-early in the morning, 
12 and then it would, I believe, along the way in Connecticut pick more people up, and then 
13 just go straight to Washington. 
14 
15 Q Okay. 
And then how about when you got on the bus? Did you learn anything about, 
16 kind of, the other people that were on it? Did you learn anything about the Facebook 
17 group? What was, kind of, the --for lack of a better term, what was the vibe? 
18 A A lot of people that were, like, really excited to go. 
19 Q Okay. 
20 A I recognized one woman. I couldn't place, like, where I knew her from. 
21 But I didn't really talk to anybody. 
22 Q Okay. This woman that you thought you might know, did you figure out 
23 who she was eventually? 
24 
25 A I think she might have been one of my teachers in school. 
Q Okay. So not, like, a celebrity or something. Just -- 1

A No. 
Q --somebody you recognized from around town. Okay. 
A Yeah. 
Q Got it. 
And, then, you didn't know anybody else on the bus other than your mom? 
A 
Q Correct, and then the lady who I think was my teacher. 
Right. Understood. 
And, then, so what --I understand something happened on the way down. The 
9 bus driver got lost? Is that what happened? 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 D.C.? A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Yes. I believe we got lost in New York. 
Okay. And so, then, I take it that caused, sort of, some delay in getting into 
Yes. 
Okay. So about what time did you end up getting into D.C.? 
It was after the President had already spoken. 
Okay. 
And, then, why don't you just tell me about that? Tell me about arriving in D.C. 
18 and then how you got off the bus. 
19 A We had parked. I don't know any of, like, what anything's called there, 
20 but --
21 Q Sure. 
22 A --we had parked. We got off the bus. And then I remember walking to, 
23 like, a big open field, and there was, like, a statue. And then I believe the Capitol was 
24 right there in front of us. And then we kind of just made our way up there. 
25 - Can I backtrack quickly?  20 
- Sure.

3 Q So, on the bus, you obviously missed the speech. Were people on the bus 
4 following it live, like, you know, on their phones? 
5 Yeah A

20 saying? Q

Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Q 
A So were people talking about the speech? 
Did you hear people talking about going to the Capitol? 
Not that I can remember. 
Was anyone talking about Vice President Pence? 
I don't think so. I can't really remember. 
Do you have any memory of what people were, like, talking about then? 
A lot of them were just upset that we weren't there in time. 
Okay. But they weren't talking specifics about what President Trump was 
Not that I can remember. 
Okay. Thank you. 
BY-
Do you remember hearing any of the speech while you were on the bus? 
I believe either my mom had it on her phone or she had me pull it up on my 
21 phone. But wasn't really paying attention. I was just looking at everything else 
22 around. 
23 Q Okay. So you don't really remember any specific parts of the speech or 
24 anything that President Trump said? 
25 A No.  21 
1 Q Okay. Do you remember just, like, a general feeling? Did it make you 
2 excited? And I'm talking about his speech in particular. Did it make you excited? You 
3 know, did he convince you about his thoughts on the election? Any thoughts you 
4 remember about the speech? 
5 
6 
7 A In the nicest way to put it, I didn't really care too much to listen to it. 
Q Gotcha. Yeah. Understood. 
Okay. So, then --let's see. So you get off the bus. And then, kind of, what's 
8 everybody on the bus doing, or what's the general plan from there? 
9 A I remember everybody getting off the bus and then saying that we were 
10 going to meet back at a certain point. I don't remember. And then most people 
11 just --I don't remember, like, watching where everybody went, but they kind of just went. 
12 I think most of the people started walking towards the Capitol. And some people just 
13 stayed in, like, the open field area. 
14 Q Okay. And by "open field area," is that, like, The Mall? Do you know what 
15 I mean when I say "The Mall"? 
16 
17 
18 A No. I'm sorry. 
Q Okay. No, that's okay. 
Okay. And, then, I take it that you and your mother joined some of the people 
19 that were walking towards the Capitol? 
20 
21 A Yes. 
Q Okay. And what did you think about what you saw around this time? So, 
22 as you were walking from the bus and then just start to walk towards the Capitol, tell me 
23 about what you saw. 
24 A I remember just thinking, wow, this is a lot of people, a lot of people just 
25 dressed in, like, red, white, and blue or Trump attire, stuff like that.  22 
1 Q Uh-huh. Okay. And how about people dressed up in, like, military gear? 
2 Did you see a lot of that? 
3 A Not necessarily. I do remember seeing some people dressed like that, and I 
4 thought it was a little weird. 
5 Q Why did you think it was weird? 
6 A Just because, like, why would you need to dress up in, like, military gear with 
7 helmets? Like, that was --what would you --why would you wear that? 
8 
9 Q Yeah. Was it, like, sort of surprising to see that? 
A Kind of, but not really, because I thought maybe some people are just very 
10 patriotic and wanted to dress like that. I didn't think of what it could've been used for at 
11 the time. 
12 
13 
14 
15 Q 
A Right. Like, at that time, it seemed more of, like, a costume than it was -­
Yes. 
Q --anything. Okay. 
Okay. And then tell me a little about, kind of, as you start to walk closer and 
16 closer to the Capitol, what's your experience? 
17 A I remember the closer we got, seeing a lot of people were just, like --it was 
18 like when you're at a concert and they're, like, packed like sardines kind of thing. And 
19 then I remember seeing a lot of people waving Trump flags, American flags, a few 
20 different kinds of flags, not necessarily, like, country type of flags but, like, just wording 
21 on the flags. 
Q Right. Right. 22 
23 And then what did you have with you as you were walking? Did you guys bring 
24 anything in particular like signs? 
25 A My mom had a sign. I didn't have a sign. I think I just wore a fanny pack  23 
1 that had --I wear contacts, so I brought an extra pair --ChapStick, my license, and I think 
2 my debit card. 
3 Q Okay. How about, were you wearing, like, a Trump T-shirt, or what 
4 were --any Trump gear? 
5 A I believe I had a Trump sweatshirt on underneath my jacket. And I think we 
6 had bought Trump hats there because it was so cold. 
7 Q Okay. 
8 And, then, about how long did it take you to walk from wherever the bus was 
9 parked to where it started to get crowded, like you were talking about kind of being at a 
10 concert? 
11 
12 A Not very long. I think maybe 15 minutes. 
Q Okay. And, then, as you're doing that walk, I assume you have --do you 
13 have a smartphone? 
14 
15 A Yes. 
Q Okay. And were you watching any videos or were you doing anything on 
16 social media as you were making this walk? 
17 
18 A I don't think so. 
Q Okay. So, then, I take it you weren't, kind of, like, following anybody and 
19 their activity on the 6th, like, watching livestreams or anything like that? 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 A No. 
Q Okay. Okay. 
Okay. And then --- go ahead. BY-
Q Yeah, I just wanted to ask, how did this --did this feel different than the 
25 other Trump rallies you had been to?  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 A Kind of. I could --it felt like a lot of people were more angry at this one. 
Q Did you hear anyone expressing that anger? 
A There were a few people yelling the closer that we got. 
Q Did you hear what they were yelling about? 
A Not really. There was plenty of people chanting, too, that you couldn't 
6 really make out what they were yelling. 
7 Q Did you ever see people dressed in military fatigues or similar attire at 
8 previous Trump rallies? 
9 
10 A 
Q Not that I can remember. 
Do you remember why you and your mom decided to follow that crowd 
11 when you got off the bus? 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 A Not really. 
Q So you didn't know --you didn't know where you were going? 
A I personally didn't. 
Q Did your mom say, "We're going to walk over to the Capitol"? 
A 
Q She didn't say it. I just kind of, like, followed her. 
Right. But did she seem to --was there any sense to you --like, did you 
18 have any sense that you were going to the Capitol? 24 
19 A No, not really. It was kind of, like, a mentality, just follow where everybody 
20 else is. 
21 
22 
23 Q Okay. Thank you. BY-
Q Okay. Can you describe to me where you were when it started to get 
24 crowded like a concert, like you talked about? 
25 A I think --it was on the --if you were looking at the building, it was on the left  25 
1 side of where the scaffolding was. 
2 Q Okay. So you were pretty close to the Capitol Building at that point where 
3 it started to get really crowded? 
4 
5 A Yes. 
Q Okay. And then why don't you --can you walk me through, kind of, what 
6 happened once you got to that crowded area? 
7 A I remember that the closer that we had gotten, I remember just, like, looking 
8 behind me and seeing so many people. And even if we tried to leave, it was like we 
9 couldn't, because people, they just wanted to keep pushing forward. 
10 And then I remember, I think people started throwing, like, water bottles. And 
11 then there were more police presence on the Capitol. And then I remember a few 
12 people having, like, a medical emergency that were brought through the crowd. 
13 And then people started throwing more things. I think it was, like, tear gas being 
14 thrown into the crowd. And that just made people even more upset. You would think 
15 that would, like, make people disperse. Instead, people got even more upset, started 
16 throwing more things. 
17 I remember being pushed forward and not being able to, like, leave. So me and 
18 my mom just kept being, like, shoved forward. 
19 And I remember, like, guards or police officers coming out, dressed in, like --with 
20 shields and, like, trying to push people back. And me and my mom were kind of stuck, 
21 not being able to leave, and being pushed forward. 
22 
23 Q Okay. 
Let's go back a little bit. -was asking about why you decided to follow, kind 
24 of, the crowd. Did you remember your mom ever talking about wanting to go to the 
25 Capitol or march to the Capitol before you guys arrived in D.C.?  1 
2 A 
Q No. 
Okay. 26 
3 And then how about, when you got there on the bus and you see people walking 
4 there, was your mom interested in going to the Capitol, or it just seemed like she was 
5 following the crowds? 
6 
7 
8 A It seemed like she was just following the crowd. 
Q Okay. 
Okay. So, then, you're following the crowd, and it gets more and more crowded, 
9 and you start to get kind of pushed toward the front. And you mentioned that tear gas 
10 was coming in too. Were you guys getting exposed to that tear gas? 
11 A Not initially. When it started to get more hectic, we were. 
12 Q Okay. And did you try to leave at that point and you just couldn't because 
13 of the crowd, or what was going on? 
14 A Yes. We tried to leave, I believe, two or three times, and there were just so 
15 many people that it was like, you couldn't get through. 
16 I remember, like, the people that were having medical emergencies, like, the 
17 people that were carrying them were literally screaming, like, "She's having a heart 
18 attack, you need to move," and it was just so hard for them to get through. 
19 
20 
21 Q Yeah. 
What were you and your mom talking about as this all was going on? 
A I don't think we really talked. I just remember her not letting go of, like, my 
22 arm or my hand and just watching everybody else. 
23 Q Yeah. Maybe this sounds like a silly question or too simple of a question, 
24 but was that scary --
25 A Yes.  Q 
A 
Q 
mom? 
A 
Q --to be in that crowd? 
Definitely. 
Yeah. Were you afraid that you were going to get separated from your 
Yeah. I don't think I ever let go of some part of her. 
Gotcha. 27 
1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 Okay. So you continued to get pushed closer and closer towards the front. And 
8 then I think you said you started to see police that were in, kind of, like, gear or riot gear 
9 that were pushing the crowd back. And you kept getting, kind of, caught in between 
10 those two groups. 
11 
12 What happened then? Kind of, what happened next? 
A I remember the people --there was probably, like, four lines of people 
13 between us, but I think I was standing on something, so I could see above. And I 
14 remember watching people push past them, try to take the shields away. I think it was 
15 bike racks that were, like, in between, and people were, like, picking them up and trying 
16 to push them into, like, the guards or police officers. 
17 BY-
18 Q Speaking of those bike racks, you said you were getting pushed, right? So 
19 you couldn't really move. But did you climb up a bike rack? 
20 
21 
22 A Correct. I did. 
Q So why did you do that? 
A That was probably after, like, 30 minutes of still pushing, the people pushing 
23 back. And then, at some point, I remember that the police officers had left or just, like, 
24 moved down. And people were still, like, upset at that point, that I remember --I'm not 
25 sure if the bike rack was already put up at this point, but people started to try to climb up  28 
1 the building. And I remember watching someone get sprayed in the face with 
2 something as they already made it up the scaffolding. 
3 And at that point, I think because so many people had already gone up there and 
4 there were so many people pushing forward, that that's when me and my mom had 
5 started to just go with the crowd. 
6 
7 
8 
9 Q Okay. So you felt it was safer to move forward? 
A Well, we couldn't really turn around. It was just so many people pushing. 
Q Okay. Did you see an alternate path? 
A I can't really remember. There were just so --like, if we were to look 
10 behind us, there were just, as far as the eye could see, just people, like, just a giant 
11 crowd. 
12 Q Right. But, you know, even in a giant crowd, sometimes you can push 
13 through. So I'm just trying to think, what was your sense of what would happen if you 
14 didn't climb the bike rack? 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 A I can't really remember right now. I really don't know. 
Q So was it, you got --was it something like, you were just reacting? 
A I would say yes. 
Q Okay. Thank you. BY-
Q So the crowds continue to push, and you're kind of stuck there for you said 
21 about 30 minutes, it seemed like? 
22 
23 A It seemed like. I'm not sure of an exact time. 
Q Okay. But, at some point, you see the bike rack. Did you also say, though, 
24 that you had just seen somebody try to climb up that way and up the scaffolding and then 
25 they got sprayed?  29 
1 A I'm not sure if they had climbed up the bike rack, but they had somehow 
2 made it up to, like, the stairs. 
3 Q Oh, okay. Okay. So that was a different route. So, on a different route, 
4 up scaffolding, you saw somebody get sprayed. And then you and your mom saw 
5 another route that was these bike racks that were stacked up. 
6 A I think it was the same way, because it was the same area that we had gone. 
7 I just don't know if they used the bike rack to get up there. 
8 Q Gotcha. Okay. 
9 Then, I guess, was it worrying you that you guys were heading towards the place 
10 that that guy had just been sprayed by police? 
11 A Yes. I think, because there was so much adrenaline with everyone, that it 
12 was terrifying, but at the same time, like, you're not really thinking of a whole lot. 
13 Q Okay. So that looked like, kind of, the easiest route or the only place that 
14 you could go, I guess. 
15 And so tell me, kind of, how that happens. You start to climb the bike rack, and 
16 then what happens? 
17 A I think my mom had pushed me to get me up first, and then I remember 
18 waiting and grabbing her hand or something like that to help her up. And then I 
19 remember going in, like, the scaffolding and up the stairs. And then we were at the very 
20 top of the stairs. 
21 And then I remember, like, there was a whole crowd in front of us. And, at that 
22 point, if it was either --we had gone through a door, and the doors had already been 
23 opened or broken. And I remember, that's when we had initially gone in. 
24 Q Okay. So about how long did it take you --once you started climbing the 
25 bike rack and then get through the scaffolding and go up the stairs, how long did that  1 take you? 
2 
3 A 
Q Not very long. Maybe a minute, 2 minutes. 
Okay. And do you know about what time it is at this point as you're 
4 entering those doors? 
5 
6 
7 A 
Q No. Sorry. I don't know. 
Okay. 
You know, I know you had seen the guy get sprayed, and, obviously, there was 30 
8 tear gas going off. Did you have any sense that you shouldn't be entering those doors? 
9 Or what did you think as you were going in the doors? 
10 A I think, in the moment, it was just more scary and adrenaline, than to really 
11 think about what was going on. 
12 Q Uh-huh. Gotcha. 
13 And so you go into the doors. Did you see any fighting or any violence around 
14 that door area as you were entering? 
15 A No. I remember that the doors were already opened, and then walking 
16 inside, and it was just people just walking around, like, just calmly walking. It was very 
17 surprising. And I remember walking around with my mom just in, like, big open areas, 
18 seeing people just walk around like it was just a normal day. 
19 
20 Q Okay. BY-
21 Q How did you get into the Capitol, again? Did you go through a window, or 
22 did you go through the door? 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A We went through a door. 
Through a door? What did the door look like when you got up there? 
I can't remember. I just remember doors being open and just walking  1 through with my mom. 
2 
3 
4 Q Okay. Did you see broken glass around you? 
A Not that I can remember. 
Q So I'll just represent to you that you entered about 9 minutes after the first 
5 people broke in. So I'm just --what did you see? Did you --in the distance, when 
6 you're coming up, did you see anything happening? 
7 A I don't think so. I think that whatever had been broken had already been 
8 broken, and I didn't see anyone breaking anything. 
Q Did you notice the mood of the people around the door? 
A Just very energetic, like, excited. 
Q So they were jubilant? 
I'm sorry. I don't even know what that means. 31 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 A 
Q Excited and happy at the same time. So, like, if you had happiness and was 
14 excited --excitement it could be either happiness or, like, a combination of those two. 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 A Yes. 
Q Okay. 
Go ahead,_ 
BY-
Q How about you? How did you feel at that point? 
A A little worried. Just not really letting go of my mom or letting her out of 
21 my sight. And I'm sure she --she was doing the same, I'm sure. 
22 
23 
24 
25 Q Yeah. Did --
A I --sorry. 
Q Sorry. No, you can go ahead. 
A I was just kind of, like, letting her lead the way, kind of thing, and just going  32 
1 with the crowd. 
2 Q Okay. 
3 What was your --to the extent you could kind of understand it or see it in your 
4 mother, what was her mood? 
5 A I'm not quite sure. She usually just has a very serious face, so it's kind of 
6 hard to tell sometimes. 
7 Q As you guys are kind of getting pushed towards the building and then come 
8 up and get to the doors and enter, were you guys joining in any of the chanting and 
9 cheering that was going on? 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A I personally wasn't, and I don't think my mom was. 
Okay. Your mom still had her sign, though, right? 
Yes. 
Okay. 
I remember her saying, though, that she didn't really want to carry it, but she 
15 was afraid to let it go, because she could see, like, some people just seemed a little too 
16 crazy, and she didn't want it to be used at some sort of weapon for anyone. So she just 
17 wanted to, like, hold on to it, keep it close. 
18 
19 
20 
21 Q Okay. Do you remember her --
- Can I ask--oh, sorry. Go ahead. BY-
Q Do you remember her using the sign at all to cheer or was she, like, raising it 
22 to show people the sign? 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q Not that I can remember. 
Okay. 
Do you know why she --it just seems a little odd that she would bring the sign,  33 
1 and, obviously, she maybe agreed with whatever was on the sign and wanted to show it 
2 at that time, but now I understand you're saying that she wasn't really showing the sign 
3 and, you know, maybe wasn't, like, hoisting it in the air proudly. 
4 Can you tell me why --how that happened? 
5 
6 
7 A 
Q 
A Like, why she brought the sign? 
Yeah. Why did she bring the sign if she didn't want to use it? 
I think that she had thought it would be more of like the rallies that we had 
8 been to previous. And my mom, all throughout her life --like, if her job --like, they 
9 would go on strike and they'd have rallies and stuff, she's always made signs that have 
10 just something witty to say on them. So, to me, it wasn't anything that seemed 
11 different. It was just, that's what she's always done. 
12 
13 Q 
A Understood. 
I think just because, like, signs --you pay attention to somebody that has a 
14 sign, and it makes a point. So I think that's why she did it. 
15 
16 Q BY-
Can I return to your point you made about your mom? She was worried 
17 that if she dropped it, someone could use it as a weapon. But you said everyone 
18 seemed peaceful. So why did your mom think that? 
19 A I think up to the point, like, when people were getting tear gassed and angry 
20 and pushing, like, that part. But not when we had gone into the building at first. It 
21 was very calm, watching people walk around. Further into it, we realized there were 
22 some people that were violent. 
23 
24 Q 
A Well, when did you notice that? 
I remember the first --I think we had --we were passing by a staircase, I 
25 believe, and I remember hearing a female officer say, there's a shooter, someone's  34 
1 shooting. And then I remember us trying to leave and watching people, I 
2 think --because, hearing that, people were, like, pushing people out of the way, trying to 
3 leave. 
4 We got closer to the door to leave, and I remember hearing somebody say there 
5 was a bomb. And I remember, like, me and my mom running back, like, not really 
6 knowing where to go, didn't know where we were, how to get out, and just people, like, 
7 just kind of going crazy, hearing that kind of thing, and just everyone for themselves, it 
8 seemed like. 
9 
10 
11 Q 
A 
Q But you didn't hear the shooting; you just heard an officer say it? 
Correct. 
Okay. Do you remember if you were in a room with a bunch of statues 
12 when you heard that? 
13 A I don't think so. I don't remember seeing statues. 
14 
15 
16 Q 
A 
Q Do you remember going downstairs at any point? 
I don't think I ever went downstairs. 
So, reading your statement of the offense, which goes along with the guilty 
17 plea, it doesn't say you were downstairs, but it does say you proceeded into the Capitol 
18 Crypt. 
19 So the crypt is --and 1111 can correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe it's a room 
20 that is circular, with statues sort of around it. Do you remember being in a room like 
21 that? 
22 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A 
Q Not really. 
Do you remember seeing a lot of police officers at any time? 
Yes. 
Okay. And what was happening to them?  35 
1 A I remember they were in a doorway. And I remember me and my mom 
2 were kind of standing back and, like, watching a crowd of people go up to them and 
3 saying, like, they wanted to go in. And I remember the police officer saying, if you go 
4 farther than this, you will be arrested. And I remember me and my mom just standing 
5 there and watching what was happening. 
6 And I remember, I think one guy got a little too close, and I can't remember if the 
7 police officer had pushed him back or what had happened, but I think at some point the 
8 guy had sprayed the police officer in the face with something. And that's when people 
9 just --like, the police officer started getting the guy. The people were trying to push 
10 past the police. 
11 And, at that point, my mom --since they --it was almost like everyone started 
12 running. They had knocked into my mom. She had fell down. And that's when we 
13 tried to get out. And I remember, walking back, that's when we had heard the police 
14 officer say that someone had been shot. Then trying to leave and hearing, oh, there's a 
15 bomb. And then just everybody going crazy. 
16 Q Okay. So it's very fast-paced. But it's fair to say that in around the same 
17 time period as when you saw people physically and probably violently interacting with the 
18 police is about when you heard that there was a shooting too? 
19 
20 
21 A About probably 5 minutes after that. 
Q Okay. And do you remember what was going through your head? 
A Not really. Just adrenaline, thinking, "Let's leave. We have to leave. 
22 This is terrifying." 
23 Q Okay. 
24 Go ahead, -
25 - No, I was just actually thinking, how's your battery doing? Do you  1 want to take a couple-minute break, and you can you plug your phone in? 
2 
3 Ms. Krzywicki. Yes, please. I was just going to say that. 
- Okay. Cool. Why don't we take 5 minutes? We'll go off the 
4 record now, and we'll be back at 4 o'clock. 36 
5 And you can feel free to mute your video and turn your video off during that time 
6 if you want to. 
7 
8 
9 Ms. Krzywicki. Okay. Thank you. 
- Yep. 
[Recess.]  37 
1 
2 [4:03 p.m.] 
3 - And we're back on the record at 4:03.

5 Q So, Carla, I was just going to try one more time. -had described to 
6 you the crypt. Do you remember being in a room --it's the room that has all the 
7 columns. Like, you might've had to, like, go through a couple different columns. Does 
8 that ring any bells? 
9 
10 
11 A Oh. That sounds more familiar. 
Q Okay. 
And so you spent some time there, and you're walking around. What 
12 eventually --and you might've started to talk about this, but what eventually led you to 
13 leave the Capitol? 
14 A Watching the police officers, like, fight with the crowd, and then watching 
15 the guy pepper spray or whatever he sprayed in the cop's face, and then watching a fight 
16 break out. My mom had fallen down because someone had, like, knocked into her. 
17 And then trying to leave and then hearing that somebody had been shot or there was a 
18 shooting. And then still trying to leave, hearing somebody else say that there's a bomb. 
19 Just all of those events, trying to leave. 
20 
21 
22 Q Okay. 
And then tell us about how you ended up leaving or how that worked. 
A I believe we had left at the same door that we had come in. So we finally 
23 had made it to the door, and I remember it was very packed, and people weren't really 
24 moving. And I remember seeing at that point, like, recognizing, like, that the windows 
25 had been broken and that, just looking around, it just looked horrible. And a lot of  38 
1 people chanting. 
2 And, at that point, it wasn't necessarily scary at that point. It seemed fairly 
3 normal. And I think just everybody else around us, it was --I don't want to say exciting, 
4 but just the feeling of it was, like, adrenaline, I guess. 
5 Q How long, looking back, do you think you spent in the building, in the Capitol 
6 Building? 
7 A I want to say maybe 30 minutes. I don't really know an exact time. It 
8 felt --it felt like 30 minutes. 
9 Q Okay. 
10 And, then, did you say when you were leaving it looked like it was more crowded 
11 than when you had first arrived? 
12 
13 A Around the Capitol, yes. I didn't really look farther than that. 
Q Okay. So just around the Capitol? How about inside the Capitol Building, 
14 like, near the doors that you had entered and exited --
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 A Yes. It was a lot more crowded. 
Q Okay. So more people had started coming in --
A Yes. 
Q --during the time that you were there? Okay. 
And, then, tell us a little bit about trying to leave at that point. Because, 
20 obviously, you went in the doors because you felt like you couldn't go the other way, but 
21 now you're exiting the doors. What are you seeing now? 
22 A As we left --I don't remember there being a ramp. I remember coming 
23 out, and there was, like, a ramp out the door. And then I remember seeing on the left 
24 side a line of police officers with, like --with reflective gear on, I think it was. And I don't 
25 remember any of them talking. They were just very straight-faced. They looked very  39 
1 scared. 
2 And I remember --I think we had walked down the stairs and we were walking 
3 around the building. And I remember, as we left, I remember seeing what looked 
4 like --I don't know if they were police officers or what they were, but dressed in, like, all 
5 black, like, riot gear, I want to say it looked like. 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 Q Okay. 
Go ahead,_ 
BY-
Q 
A I was going to say, at this point, how are you feeling? 
I think more adrenaline than anything. I wasn't necessarily scared 
11 anymore. I would say --I don't know if this is the right word to use --excited almost, 
12 just that we were out and that I could tell there wasn't really any threat anymore. 
13 
14 Q At that point, did you feel you had done anything wrong or illegal? 
A I --not really. I knew that it was wrong, yes. I wasn't sure --because 
15 in --I had thought that since the doors were open --and this may make me sound very 
16 stupid, but I thought, with the doors being open and that there were police officers there, 
17 nobody was really stopping us really. So I thought, oh, we're being let in, in a sense. 
18 Like, I realize, no, afterwards, thinking that, what were they supposed to do? 
19 They couldn't just start shooting us. That would --that doesn't happen. So I realize 
20 that there wasn't much that they could've done. 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 Q And did you end up posting anything to social media when you left? 
A 
Q 
A Yes. I posted on Facebook. 
Do you remember what you said? 
Not word for word. And there's a picture of me and my mom. 
Q All right. Well, I'll read to you --this is from the statement of facts in your  40 
1 case. So you said --and I'm guessing on the time here. Whoever screenshotted it, I'll 
2 represent to you, screenshotted it at 1:41 p.m., and the post was 20 hours earlier. So, 
3 by my rough math, that's somewhere around 5:00 p.m. I don't know exactly what day, 
4 but I'm assuming around January 6th. 
5 So you post: "This is history. We do not go burning down your city and stealing 
6 from your business. We come for the government officials that are ruining our country. 
7 We go straight to the source. Change needs to happen. That is our house, and you 
8 work for us." 
9 So, assuming that's after you left the Capitol, do you remember why you posted 
10 that? 
11 A I remember feeling that --excited, in a sense. I think that, like, growing up 
12 in a conservative household and not really knowing much else at the time, just, like, what 
13 I had heard and seen --and I remember, when I did watch the news, that I remember 
14 seeing, like, people around the country burning down businesses, and I remember being, 
15 like, told or hearing, like, my parents say, like, "Oh, that's no way to get things done." 
16 And then, ironically, neither is what me and my mom had done, going in and being a part 
17 of January 6th. 
18 So I think just --I think, in my head, I had thought, oh, maybe we did something. 
19 Q I'm interested specifically in the --so you mentioned probably seeing Black 
20 Lives Matter protests or something else on the news in 2020. Is that what you think you 
21 were referencing? I don't want to put words in your mouth. 
22 A Not necessarily Black Lives Matter, no. Because in the previous summer 
23 before the election, or that year, that summer, me and my boyfriend had actually gone to 
24 support Black Lives Matter. So not necessarily talking about them, necessarily, no. 
25 Q But talking about violence associated with protests surrounding Black Lives -- 1 
2 A 
Q Yes, the violence associated with it. 
Right. Okay. I'm sorry. Thank you for clarifying. I didn't want to put 
3 words in your mouth. 
4 So, comparing that to the sentence, "We come for the government officials that 41 
5 are ruining our country," so did you think that what that sentence portrays is better than 
6 the alternative of burning down a business? 
7 A I understand now that is a very poor choice of words that can be taken in a 
8 way different way than I had meant it. In my mind, it was more of, like, protesting, or, 
9 like, my mom, how she goes and brings signs when she goes to rallies. I was thinking 
10 more in that sense, rather than what it can be taken as, violence. 
11 Q So can you just maybe clarify, then, when you said, "We come for the 
12 government officials," what did you mean? 
13 A As in, like, protesting. As in, like, go to, like, rallies where people are at, 
14 like, a capital. Like, I remember, years ago, when me and my mom had gone to Trump 
15 rallies, there was one in Connecticut at, like, a convention center, where the capital --a 
16 building like that. And just, like, getting together and, like, holding signs or chanting 
17 and, like, making a point. Just, like, coming together and showing, like, there's a whole 
18 bunch of people that feel this way and, like, change needs to happen. 
19 
20 
21 Q 
A 
Q It's just a very specific verb, right, "come," after you had just -­
Yes. 
--gone into the Capitol. So I'm wondering if anything around you inspired 
22 you to use that wording instead of the more protest-oriented language you just 
23 referenced. 
24 A No. It was just a poor choice of words, not really thinking of what other 
25 way to necessarily put it.  42 
1 Q Okay. Was your mom speaking in language like that after you left the 
2 Capitol? 
A Not that I can remember. 
Q Did you hear people chanting, "You work for us," or, "This is our house"? 
A I remember hearing people chant like that, yes. 
Q And what did you take that to mean? 3 
4 
5 
6 
7 A In my mind at the time, I think I thought, well, a government, like, position is 
8 paid by taxes, and just taking it in a way that people chose --like, they voted on their 
9 position. So, in my mind, it's like, okay, you do work for us, you were put there by 
10 people. 
11 Q Right. But would you agree there's a difference between protest and going 
12 into the Capitol the way that it happened? 
13 
14 
15 A Yes, definitely. 
Q Okay. 
And I'm still trying to square --you said you weren't politically engaged --with this 
16 post, just because of, you know, the language you used. So --
17 
18 
19 down. 
20 A Uh-huh. 
Q --where did those ideas really come from? I'm just trying to nail that 
A I think the excitement of it. And I can definitely understand where you're 
21 coming from. It definitely seems like a crazy Trump supporter for sure. I think just the 
22 excitement of it and the adrenaline and being, like, in the moment and thinking, "Oh, 
23 wow, maybe we did something here." 
24 And then, afterwards, when I deleted it, realizing, "Wow, that was such an awful 
25 decision," and all these things that are happening, like, this --and being considered, like, a  43 
1 domestic terrorist is not good, not something that I wanted to be seen as. That's for 
2 sure. 
3 Q Okay. 
4 And the picture you posted with --I think it's with your mother --do you 
5 remember when you took that picture? 
6 
7 A 
Q We were outside --it was --
You were outside. Yeah, I'll represent it to you, because you don't have it 
8 in front of you, I just remembered. It's the two of you smiling outside the Capitol. 
9 There are a couple people on the steps. It's a selfie, it looks like. So I don't know if it 
10 was before or after. 
11 A I believe it --I'm not really sure, to be honest with you. I want to say it was 
12 after. 
13 Q Okay. So fair to say, then, that at that moment you were somewhat proud 
14 or happy that you had done it? 
15 A Not --I wouldn't say proud or happy. Just the adrenaline and excitement 
16 of it, being like, "Oh, wow, we made it out of there." 
17 
18 Q Okay. 
And then I think-is going to ask a couple of questions about --to explain 
19 to us how you moved away from that feeling. Because that's actually a very important 
20 part of the story. 
21 
22 
23 A 
Q Okay. 
BY-
Yeah. Maybe we can finish just by finishing out the day, kind of, what 
24 happened logistically. And then I'd like to talk a little bit about, kind of, how your 
25 feelings have changed since then or allow you to explain, kind of, what you think of that  44 
1 post now and, kind of, what happened on the day. 
2 A Okay. 
3 Q So, first, let's just talk about --so you said you head out of the building, and 
4 you look down the ramp, and there's some of the riot police that are there. And then 
5 how do you end up leaving the Capitol grounds? 
6 A I believe we --so we came out the door and down the ramp. And then 
7 when you're on the flat surface before the stairs, I think we had looked around a little bit, 
8 and then I think we might've gone down the stairs and walked around the building. And 
9 I remember walking around and seeing on the other side --not the opposite side, but on 
10 the next side, if that makes sense --
11 
12 Q 
A Uh-huh. 
--people at another door. And I think --I remember seeing a guy, he 
13 looked like he was hanging from something by his hands and trying to kick the other door, 
14 and people on top of each other trying to get in another door. 
15 And me and my mom just kept walking, because we were trying to find where our 
16 bus was going to be to pick us up. 
17 And I remember walking and then, to the opposite side where we went into the 
18 Capitol, seeing more what might've been, like, riot police dressed in, like, full gear. And I 
19 think there might've been others in, like, white --white, like, suits, almost, and then more 
20 people. 
21 And I think we started walking away from the Capitol Building into another, like, 
22 what looked like a field. And I remember looking at the map to see, like, what street 
23 was in front of us. And I remember walking down the street, and there were a whole 
24 bunch of people, like, walking away or getting cars or --I remember not seeing many 
25 vehicles on the road.  45 
1 And then I remember walking by what --I don't think it --it might've been a shop 
2 where they have, like, TVs in the window, and seeing the news on, and it was just all over 
3 each TV. And seeing that there was, like, a lockdown of the city and that I don't think 
4 vehicles were really allowed. So it made sense why we weren't seeing many vehicles. 
5 And wondering, is our bus still going to be able to get us? 
6 And then trying to make phone calls too. I think my mom was trying to call the 
7 people that might've been in charge of, like, the bus. And having to walk farther down 
8 to catch the bus. 
9 And then when we had got to where we were meeting the bus, I remember --I 
10 think it was --we started talking to other people that were waiting for the same bus. 
11 And then --
12 
13 
14 Q 
A Okay. 
--it took a while for the bus to get there, I remember. 
And then, once we had got on the bus, I remember we had to wait because one 
15 of --I think he was an elderly man --he ended up getting lost or stuck there. And so we 
16 waited a couple extra --I think it might've been, like, an extra 30 minutes to, like, find 
17 him. 
18 
19 
20 
21 Q Okay. 
Do you know about what time it was that you were leaving the Capitol area? 
A 
Q I'm not quite sure what time it was. 
Okay. How about any, kind of, like, timestamps for that afternoon? Do 
22 you remember a certain time and place at any point, like when you got to the bus? 
23 
24 A 
Q If I had to say, I would --I think maybe 3:00. 
Okay. And what was happening at 3 o'clock? That's when you were 
25 leaving the Capitol?  Yes. That's when we were making our way around -­
Okay. 46 
1 
2 
3 A 
Q 
A --and seeing the side of the building where people were still trying to get in, 
4 and then the opposite side where I saw more police officers and people dressed in, like, 
5 riot gear, and then making our way to find the bus. 
6 Q Gotcha. 
7 And then I know James was trying to figure out around what time you had posted 
8 the Face book post, and we thought that was close to 5:00. Do you remember when you 
9 posted that? Like, what time? 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q I want to say maybe we were on the bus. I'm not exactly sure though. 
Okay. So sometime after you left the Capitol or perhaps --
Yes. 
--on your trip back? 
Yes. 
Okay. 
16 And then you said --you mentioned that, as you were walking away, you started 
17 to see that what was going on at the Capitol was all over the news and it was kind of a big 
18 deal. What did you think then, when you started seeing that news? 
19 A At the time, I didn't really think too much about it. I thought that it was 
20 very shocking at the time, but not really thinking too much of it. Just really wanting to, 
21 like, get out of there. 
22 
23 
24 Q 
A 
Q What part was shocking? Or what do you mean, it was shocking? 
Just --I think just seeing it and knowing that I was a part of it. 
So the fact --it was the fact that it was on the news and was a big deal; that 
25 was the shocking part?  47 
A Yes, and that I was right there seeing it myself. 
Q Right. Okay. 
BY-1 
2 
3 
4 Q Sorry. I might have messed up the timing. Just to clarify, so you say you 
5 were getting shocked seeing the news, and that's when you're walking to the bus? 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 A Yes, making our way to where the bus was, yes. 
Q But you think you probably posted that Facebook message on the bus? 
A 
Q 
A I think so. I'm not exactly sure when it was posted. 
Do you remember being shocked before you posted to Facebook? 
Yes. It was after we --it was definitely after we had already came out of 
11 the Capitol. That's for sure. And I want to say that I posted it on the bus coming 
12 home. 
13 Q Okay. So how does the shock and how you're describing the shock of being 
14 involved in this, how did that play into your decision to write that Facebook post? 
15 A I'm not necessarily sure. Just, like, being shocked that it was on the news 
16 and something that I was a part of and seeing it, like, in real-time, being there, was 
17 shocking for me. And I think, still, in my mind, I wasn't --I didn't realize the severity of 
18 how awful what I had done was. 
19 Q Okay. So fair to say, the shock at that point was less about the severity of it 
20 than just the experience of it? 
21 A Yes. In my mind, I don't think I knew enough about what was going on to 
22 realize just how bad it was. 
23 
24 
25 Q Okay. Thank you. 
A Uh-huh. 
BY- 48 
1 Q Why don't we --we can take this chance for you to tell us a little bit about, 
2 kind of, that transition from the just general shock at the attention it got and the 
3 sentiment that you expressed in your Facebook post and then what you're telling us now, 
4 which I understand is that you have a different view on it now. 
5 Tell us how that idea or how that feeling evolved. 
6 
7 A 
Q Like, how I feel about, like, my post or what had happened exactly? 
Let's talk about just the events. I know you've told us you feel differently 
8 now than you did that day, right? 
9 
10 A 
Q Yes. 
Now, like you just said, you understood that entering the building --or 
11 entering the Capitol was wrong. What changed your mind? 
12 A So I think that seeing it all over the news and then realizing that people had 
13 broken into a capitol building and just hearing, like, just how much everything it cost, the 
14 people that had died, and realizing being in a building that was broken into by what you 
15 could call domestic terrorists and someone losing their life, is just so horrible to even 
16 think that I was involved with something like that. It's a horrible feeling to know that I 
17 was a part of that, that someone had lost their life because of something that I was a part 
18 of. 
19 Q Yeah, I understand. Thank you for sharing those feelings with us, and I'm 
20 sure it's hard to relive that experience. 
21 -did you have something? 
22 - No, but I was --well, I guess, do you --it sounds like you feel a little 
23 bit of responsibility. Is that right? 
24 
25 Ms. Krzywicki. Yes. 
- Okay. Thank you.  49 
BY 1 
2 Q How about conversations with your mom, kind of, immediately after? How 
3 did she feel about the events of that day? Was she, kind of, in the same state of mind as 
4 you were? 
A 
Q I would say so, yes. 
Okay. 5 
6 
7 Let's talk about, kind of, the bus ride home. What did you guys talk about on the 
8 bus ride home? 
9 A I don't really remember talking too much. I remember just watching, like, 
10 the news on my phone about, like, what everybody else --like, what the news was saying 
11 and what people were posting about it. 
12 Q Okay. And so you were just monitoring that. And what did you think of 
13 what you were seeing? 
14 A The news --I remember watching, like, some parts of the news that --I 
15 remember --because my boyfriend was at home watching our dogs for us. I remember 
16 him texting me and being like, "Are you okay? What's going on?" 
17 remember --because I think it was his mother --his mother was sending him news 
18 articles, and I think he was forwarding them to me, and that's what I was seeing. 
19 And then to go on, like, Facebook, I think I had --I had more conservative friends 
20 on there that were posting, not really supportive things about it, but more --I would say, 
21 yeah, more supportive, that they didn't really realize how bad it was either. 
22 Q What sort of things did you see your friends posting that seemed 
23 supportive? 
24 A I remember one image in particular was showing back in the summertime 
25 when certain groups of people were, like, burning businesses and all those things that  50 
1 were going on, and then taking a picture of just, like, the crowd that was there to see 
2 President Trump at the time speak, and then saying, "This is okay, but this isn't okay," 
3 meaning the people that were --the picture made it seem like it was, like, a peaceful 
4 protest, when in reality it wasn't. I don't think they realized that. 
5 Q Were you seeing those posts around the same time you were making your 
6 own posts, do you remember? 
7 A Correct, yes, I think it was. Because seeing on Facebook that --thinking in 
8 my head, oh, it wasn't really that bad, but kind of torn because I was like, well, it's all over 
9 the news. But, in my mind, I was thinking, maybe we made a point, kind of thing, maybe 
10 we actually did something. 
11 Q Right. Okay. 
12 So you're seeing some of the news coverage that's obviously condemning what 
13 happened that day, but then on social media you're seeing some of your friends post 
14 some more supportive things and some more, kind of, like, meme-type posts. 
15 When --and you described that conflict in seeing both of those things happening 
16 and not sure where you fell there. When did you, kind of, pick a side? 
17 A I think it was a week after, and just realizing how bad it was and seeing 
18 that --once it kind of settled down, I want to say, and then people realized what actually 
19 happened and that people had unfortunately passed away, and especially the woman 
20 that had been shot inside --like, ugh. I think --and especially after --after that week, it 
21 was just more and more realizing just how awful it had been. 
22 And then I believe it was in the summertime when the FBI had come out to 
23 interview me and my mom, and realizing just how serious it was. Even though we 
24 hadn't hurt anyone or vandalized anything or stole anything, we were still a part of it. 
25 And I think us being, I'm sure, lesser of all the rest of the people there, still very, very  51 
1 serious. 
2 Q Right. Okay. 
3 And, then --so, I mean, just kind of looking back at that in general, it sounds a 
4 little bit like seeing some of the consequences is a little bit what changed your mind. 
5 Can you just describe generally for me, what changed your mind in the end? What 
6 were, kind of, the most important things that you saw that helped change your mind? 
7 A I think that seeing it more and more on the news and what it was referred to 
8 as, "domestic terrorists," and ended up, like, on Facebook, especially after being arrested, 
9 getting death threats and just threats in general, saying how we were domestic terrorists, 
10 we deserved to rot in jail, and realizing just how people had felt about it and realizing the 
11 seriousness of it. And just, especially, just being everywhere, it was everywhere, 
12 realizing how awful it was. 
13 Q Right. Understood. 
14 How about, as you were leaving the Capitol and on the day that you were heading 
15 back, or the bus ride back, do you remember any of the President's messages, kind of, 
16 towards the end of the day or the end of the events at the Capitol? 
17 A Not really. 
18 Q Okay. Did you have any thoughts at the end of the day on January 6th or 
19 after about President Trump or how he reacted to the situation? 
20 A Not really. As surprising as it is, like, being there and what I had posted, I 
21 didn't really care too much about what he really was saying. 
22 
23 
24 
25 that? Q 
A 
Q Do you remember the impeachment process after that? 
Slightly, yes. 
Okay. Did you pay attention to any of that news or have any feelings about  1 
2 A Not really. 
Q Okay. 
3 Of the other people on the bus, do you remember talking to anybody else about 
4 their experience on you guys' way back? 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 A I don't think so. I didn't really talk to anyone. 
Q Okay. Do you know if anybody else on the bus entered the Capitol also? 
A I don't think so. 
Q Okay. 
BY-
Q Were you paying attention to election fraud issues at all at that time? 52 
10 
11 A I don't think so. I remember sometimes my mom had talked about it, but I 
12 just --I kind of thought it was silly. 
13 
14 
15 Q Okay. So it was not a reason you went to D.C., obviously. 
A No. I had only gone because of my mom. 
Q Yeah. In your conversations with her in the last year, does election fraud 
16 ever come up? 
17 A No. 
18 Q Okay. Thank you. 
19 BY-
20 Q This might be a personal question, and fine if you're not comfortable 
21 answering it. But just kind of in understanding the effects of January 6th, I'm curious, 
22 has it changed you and your mom's relationship? Or what does your mom --you and 
23 your mom's relationship, how does it relate to what happened on January 6th? 
24 A I think, at first, I was kind of --I was upset with her that we had gone and 
25 that I kind of just followed along. But after I had gotten over that and realized I still  53 
1 chose to go with her, I still followed, I could've at any point been like, "Hey, this seems a 
2 little weird," like, I just --I still share responsibility for going and being there. 
3 But, now, I just --we don't really talk about it. Sometimes she'll try to bring it up 
4 and be like, "Oh, how's it going for you?", and I just don't really --I don't really like talking 
5 about it. 
6 So, overall, like, in general, our relationship is fine. I just think it has put --it has 
7 put a strain on it. 
8 Q Right. Understood. 
9 We talked about, kind of, specifically impeachment, but I'm just curious if your 
10 views --I know you said before the election and before January 6th you thought of 
11 yourself as more conservative and generally supported President Trump. Has that 
12 changed since January 6th? 
13 A I would say I definitely lean more to the left now. I wouldn't --like, if the 
14 election back in 2020 were to happen again, I don't think I would even vote. I don't 
15 really agree with either side too much to pick one. So I would say I'm just very neutral, 
16 open to see both sides of everything. 
17 Q Okay. That's a good position sometimes. 
18 Do you have any thoughts --I mean, I just want to, you know, give you an 
19 opportunity, if there's anything that we talked about previously or just any other 
20 thoughts you have about the events of January 6th or, kind of, your experience of it and 
21 the time after that you haven't had a chance to share with us, just anything else you 
22 might want to tell us? 
23 A Not that I can think of. Just that, if it were to happen again, I would've 
24 stayed home for sure, definitely. That would never --that was definitely not something I 
25 would ever, ever do.  1 
2 Q Yeah. Yeah. Understood. 
- I think we're getting pretty close to being done. 
3 Ms. Shaner, I might have some questions just, kind of, about Carla's case at the 
4 end that you might be better positioned to answer. 
5 But, -do you have any more general questions for Carla? 
6 - Nope. 
7 - And just for the record, as it stands today, Ms. Shaner, can you just 
8 give us kind of a quick synopsis of where Carla's case is? 
9 Ms. Shaner. Carla entered a guilty plea, and she's completed a probation 
10 interview, and she's pending sentence on April the 22nd. 
11 
12 
13 Carla. - Okay. 
Ms. Shaner. And her mother also pied guilty and is going to be sentenced after 
- Okay. Understood. 
All right. I think, unless anybody else has anything else for the record --
- Yeah, just quickly. 
llllwas probably going to say this, but I like to interrupt him sometimes. 54

18 We just want to thank you, Carla, for taking the time to talk to us. I know, on our 
19 end, it can be difficult to get perspective of people who were actually there and who have 
20 been charged. So we really appreciate you, you know, talking to us and explaining to us 
21 what was going on that day, how you felt, how you've felt since. It's really important for 
22 us to get this kind of information, so I just wanted to let you know that we appreciate it. 
23 
24 
25 Ms. Krzywicki. Of course. Thank you. 
- Yeah. I'll --
Ms. Shaner. I -- 1 
2 - Oh,sorry. 
Ms. Shaner. --just wanted to add that, after January 6th, Carla sought some 
3 treatment for anxiety and depression. And she also moved out of her mother's house 55 
4 into her father's house. And that might've also contributed to her leftward movement. 
5 
6 
7 
8 Is that correct, Carla? 
Ms. Krzywicki. Yes. 
- Great. Well, I'll second --thanks for that, Ms. Shaner. 
I'll second what-said. I was going to say it off the record, but-is 
9 right; it's probably better said on the record. Because I would definitely like to express 
10 our gratitude to you for coming in and talking to us. 
11 Like -said, you know, we're really just interested in getting everybody's 
12 perspective and understanding, kind of, what brought people there that day and how 
13 they've felt about it since. So thank you for being part of that, Carla. We very much 
14 appreciate it. 
15 
16 
17 
18 Ms. Krzywicki. Thank you. You're welcome. 
- Okay. 
And then, with that, we can go into recess. Thank you.
