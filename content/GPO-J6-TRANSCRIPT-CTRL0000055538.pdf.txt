2 - Good afternoon, everyone. 
3 This is a deposition of Dr. Kelli Ward conducted by the House Select Committee to 
4 Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol pursuant to House 
5 Resolution 503. 
6 Dr. Ward, could you please state your full name and spell your last name for the 
7 record? 
8 The Witness. Dr. Kelli Ward, W-a-r-d. 
9 - Thank you very much. 
10 This will be a staff-led deposition today, and members of the select committee 
11 may, of course, choose to join us and will also ask questions. 
12 Since we're doing this remotely, there's a participant list on the side of our Webex 
13 screen. We will try to identify any members of the select committee if they join and 
14 you'll be able to see their names appear there. And then, if they have any questions, 
15 the convention usually is that they'll turn on their video, so they'll pop up on your screen 
16 at that time as well. 
17 My name is I'm investigative counsel with the select committee. 
18 And I'll let my colleagues here in the room today with me also introduce themselves. 
19 Good afternoon, Dr. Ward. My name is I'm a 
20 senior investigative counsel to the committee. 
21 Good afternoon, Dr. Ward. My name's I'm a 
22 professional staff member with the committee. 
23 - Thank you. 
24 We're joined by a couple of other members of the select committee staff, 
25 including also investigative counsel with the committee, and- 1 - our chief clerk. 
2 Before we begin, we'd like to go through a few ground rules. 
3 We will be following the House deposition rules today that we provided to your 
4 counsel previously. Under the House deposition rules, counsel for other persons or 
5 government agencies may not attend, and you are, Dr. Ward, permitted to have your 
6 attorneys present. 
7 Under the House rules neither committee members nor staff may discuss the 
8 substance of your testimony that you provide today unless the committee approves 
9 release. And you and your attorney can have an opportunity to review the transcript if 
10 you wish. 
11 At this time, counsel, could you please note your appearances for the record? 
12 
13 
14 
15 Mr. Mills. Good afternoon. Laurin Mills for Dr. Ward. 
Mr. Kolodin. And good morning. Alexander Kolodin for Dr. Ward. 
- Great. 
There is an official reporter transcribing the record of this deposition. So we'll 
16 ask you, Dr. Ward, to please wait until each question is completed before you begin your 
17 response, and we will try to wait until your responses are all complete before we ask our 
18 next question. 
19 The stenographer cannot record nonverbal responses, such as shaking your head, 
20 so it's important that you please answer each question with an audible verbal response. 
21 We are, as you noted at the beginning, we are recording this deposition that's 
22 being conducted virtually, but the official record of the deposition is the record that the 
23 official reporters are taking down. 
24 We ask that you provide complete answers based on your best recollection. If 
25 the questions are not clear, please ask for clarification and we'd be happy to provide it. 4  5 
1 And then if you do not know the answer, please simply say so. 
2 You may only refuse to answer a question to preserve a privilege that is 
3 recognized by the select committee. If you refuse to answer a question based on a 
4 privilege, staff may either proceed with the deposition or seek a ruling from the chair on 
5 the objection. If the chair overrules an objection, you are required to answer the 
6 question. 
7 Again, please don't hesitate to ask us to repeat a question if you have any trouble 
8 hearing us or if it's not clear, and if you need to consult with your counsel at any time 
9 during this interview --or during this deposition, sorry --that's not a problem at all. 
10 Because we're doing this virtually, we recommend that you mute and turn off 
11 your cameras to facilitate any sort of --any private conversation that you need to have 
12 with your lawyers. 
13 If you need to have a break for any other reason during the deposition, please just 
14 let us know and we'd be happy to accommodate that. 
15 And finally, I want to remind you that it is unlawful to deliberately provide false 
16 information to Congress. And since this deposition will be under oath, providing false 
17 information could result in criminal penalties for perjury and/or for providing false 
18 statements. 
19 Do you understand that, Dr. Ward? 
20 
21 The Witness. Yes. 
- Okay. So at this time, could you please stand and raise your right 
22 hand to be sworn by the official reporter? 
23 The Reporter. Do you solemnly declare and affirm under the penalty of perjury 
24 that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing 
25 but the truth?  1 
2 
3 
4 The Witness. I do, so help me God. 
Mr. Mills. At this point, I'd like to make my statement before you continue. 
- Sure. That makes sense, Mr. Mills. Go right ahead. 
Mr. Mills. Yeah. 
5 In light of Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco's statements to CNN on January 
6 the 25th that there is an ongoing criminal investigation into the exact subject that you 
7 want to examine Dr. Ward on, and in light of this committee's written filings in the 
8 Central District of California, Santa Anna Division, in the Eastman case, Dr. Ward is going 
9 to state her name, but she is going to invoke her right not to be a witness against herself 
10 under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution to every other question. 
11 And what she will answer is, if it's okay with you guys, she will answer, "I rely on 
12 my Fifth Amendment privilege," and that will be the shorthand for that. 
13 And so Mr. Kolodin or I may assert another privilege or objection depending on 
14 your question just to preserve it. But every answer you're going to get from Dr. Ward 
15 after she states her name under oath will be, "I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege." 
16 - Okay. Thank you for that, Mr. Mills. 
17 I think, as we previously discussed, we have questions here that we'd like to ask 
18 Dr. Ward and we'll hear her objections to each of those questions. 
19 I think we may need to hear a more fulsome statement at the outset, so that we 
20 have a really clear record about what exactly it is in Dr. Ward's own words that she's 6 
21 asserting. And then once we have that on the record, I think a shorthand will suffice for 
22 the majority of the remaining questions. 
23 Mr. Mills. You have her statement. She is going to say, "I rely on my Fifth 
24 Amendment privilege." And so that's what she is going to say. 
25 - Understood. Well, we appreciate your statement at the outset  7 
1 here. I think we should go ahead and get started. We'll ask a couple of questions 
2 really sort of preliminarily to get started and when we reach the point that Dr. Ward feels 
3 it's appropriate to assert those privileges we can get that on the record. 
4 Does that work? 
5 
6 Mr. Mills. It does. 
- Okay. Any other issues that we should discuss? 
7 Or, Dr. Ward, did you have any questions about the kind of ground rules that we 
8 set out? 
9 
10 The Witness. Nope. 
- Okay. Great. Let's get going then.  8 
EXAMINATION 
BY 
Q could you please pull up exhibit No. 1? 1 
2 
3 
4 
5 Dr. Ward, we have several exhibits that we'd like to show you today. Since we're 
6 doing this virtually, we'll do it in the screen share. 
7 So for this first one, can you just confirm that you're able to see this document on 
8 the screen? 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Yes. 
Okay. Do you recognize this document? 
No. 
Okay. 
Well, yes. I mean --I can't see the entire --
Mr. Kolodin. I advise Dr. Ward to assert her Fifth Amendment privilege. 
-Okay. 
BY-
Q Dr. Ward, do you understand that you're appearing here today pursuant to a 
18 subpoena issued by the select committee dated February 15th, 2022? 
19 
20 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Dr. Ward, are you declining to answer our questions today based on the Fifth 
21 Amendment because you reasonably believe your factual responses to specific questions 
22 may tend to incriminate you? 
23 
24 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Dr. Ward, let me just read to you the relevant section of the Fifth 
25 Amendment to the United States Constitution so that you can confirm for us that this is  9 
1 the provision of the Fifth Amendment that you're relying on today for your objections. 
2 So the Fifth Amendment in relevant part reads, "No person shall be compelled in 
3 any criminal case to be a witness against himself." 
4 Is that the provision of the Fifth Amendment that you are asserting as a privilege 
5 against your testimony today? 
6 A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
7 Mr. Mills, I think it makes sense, we need to have the witness 
8 confirm what she is asserting, and there are multiple provisions of the Fifth Amendment. 
9 So if you want to take a moment to speak with Dr. Ward about that just to confirm 
10 that that is, in fact, the provision of the Fifth Amendment that she is asserting, we'd 
11 appreciate that, and then we can move forward with her just saying I'm asserting the Fifth 
12 Amendment privilege. 
13 Mr. Mills. I believe I made it clear in, at least, two communications with you the 
14 exact provision of the Fifth Amendment that we were asserting, and I made it clear on the 
15 record the exact provision that she is asserting and what the shorthand would stand for. 
16 But I'm not taking any chances that you guys will argue waiver. And so she is 
17 going to say, "I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege." It's very clear what privilege she 
18 is asserting. 
19 And it's just, it's hers to assert, Mr. Mills. So we just need her to 
20 say, yes, that that is, in fact, the provision, what you have explained is the one she's 
21 relying on. 
22 
23 
24 
25 Mr. Mills. Okay. I will do that. 
Dr. Ward, you can say yes, that that's the provision. 
Mr. Kolodin. Can we consult briefly? 
Mr. Mills. Yeah.  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 - Sure, yes. Why don't we go off the record for a moment here? 
[Discussion off the record.] 
- Let's go back on the record now. 
Mr. Mills. Why don't you ask your question again? 
- I'd be happy to. 
Ms. Ward, I've asked you a few questions. You've asserted your Fifth 10 
7 Amendment rights. And I asked you whether that was because you reasonably believed 
8 your factual responses to those questions may tend to incriminate you. 
9 Mr. Mills. Objection. That's not what you said. You cited a provision of the 
10 Fifth Amendment and that's --because the Fifth Amendment mentions nothing about 
11 incrimination. 
12 
13 - Understood. 
Mr. Mills. So read the exact words. 
14 - Yes, I was getting there, yes, Mr. Mills. 
15 So, Dr. Ward, is the provision of the Fifth Amendment that you are citing to in 
16 response to our questions today the one that reads in relevant part, "No person shall be 
17 compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself"? 
18 
19 The Witness. Yes, as well as my due process. 
- Okay. Thank you. So we will understand as we go through the 
20 remainder of our questions today that when you assert your Fifth Amendment rights that 
21 it's that provision of the Fifth Amendment to which you're referring. Okay? 
22 
23 
24 could you please bring back up exhibit No. 1. 
Okay. 
Dr. Ward, on the screen is exhibit No. 1, the subpoena issued to you by the select 
25 committee. Can you see that document?  1 
2 The Witness. Yes. 
- Okay. Thank you. 
3 The part of the subpoena that you received from the select committee requires 
4 you to produce documents and information, including any electronically stored 
5 information. 
6 Do you understand that obligation? 
7 Mr. Kolodin. I advise my client to assert her Fifth Amendment privilege. 
8

10 The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege.

11 the subpoena?

Did you conduct a search for records that might be responsive to the 
14 schedule attached to the subpoena? 
I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 11 
15 
16 A 
Q Dr. Ward, you've not produced any documents to the select committee that 
17 are responsive to the requests attached to the subpoena. Is that correct? 
18 
19 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Dr. Ward, do you intend to assert your Fifth Amendment privileges in 
20 response to any further questions that I ask you about the documents, any search or 
21 relevant documents that you discovered that were responsive to the subpoena? 
22 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Okay. Dr. Ward, do you have a Twitter handle? 
I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Okay. We're aware of a Twitter account with the name @kelliwardaz,  1 k-e-I-I-i, w-a-r-d, a-z. Are you the individual that posts through that Twitter account? 
2 
3 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Dr. Ward, we're also aware of another Twitter account that posts with the 
4 name @AZGOP. Are you an individual with control over posts under that account?

Have you been chair of the Republican Party of Arizona since approximately

Dr. Ward, I'd like to ask you some questions today about the 2020 election. 
25 I'll refer to it as the Presidential election or the 2020 election, but what I mean by that is  1 the election held on November 3rd, 2020, to elect the President of the United States. 
2 My first question for you in that topic is, what role did you have with the Trump

Q On November 3rd, 2020, FOX News called Arizona for then Vice President

19 
20 
21 
22 A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Q could you bring up exhibit No. 2, please? 
Okay. Thank you. 
Ms. Ward, this is an exhibit that shows text message communications. It's a 
23 bit --a bit hard to read, so please let us know if you need us to zoom in. 
24 
25 There we go. That's perfect. 
I'd like to draw your attention to a line in this document that has the date 13  1 November 6th, 2020. It is in blue. And it reads --it's a text message that you sent to 
2 Mark Meadows, and it reads, "Do NOT concede," with the "NOT" capitalized.

14 
15 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
I'd next like to ask you some questions about allegations of election fraud 
16 that arose following the November 3rd, 2020, election. 
17 The first question I'd like to ask you there is, what investigation did the Trump 
18 campaign do into allegations of election fraud that arose following the Presidential 
19 election? 
20 
21 
22 
23 A 
Q 
A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
What, if any, was your role in those efforts, Dr. Ward? 
I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Two days after the Presidential election, on November 5th, 2020, did you 
24 post a tweet about ways to, quote, "fix election chaos"? 
25 A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege.  15 
Q could you please bring up exhibit No. 3. 
Can you see exhibit 3, Dr. Ward? 
Yep. 1 
2 
3 
4 A 
Q Okay. So this is a tweet by @kelliwardaz posted November 5th, 2020. It 
5 writes, "How do we fix election chaos?" and then, "Let me think," and suggests several 
6 items, including vote on one specific day, require voter identification, use paper ballots, 
7 and use pens not #Sharpies. 
8 Dr. Ward, why did you tweet, "Vote on one specific day"?

13 
14 
15 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Dr. Ward, are you aware that Arizona has utilized early voting since at least 
I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Why did you tweet, "use pens not #Sharpies"? 
I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Dr. Ward, what investigation did you do into what were known as 
16 "SharpieGate" allegations before posting this tweet on November 5th? 
17 
18 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Did you speak with any Maricopa County election officials regarding these 
19 allegations about Sharpie markers? 
20 
21 
22 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
could you please bring up exhibit No. 4? 
Dr. Ward, this is another tweet posted by the account @MaricopaVote on 
23 November 3rd, 2020. Did you review this or any other voter education materials that 
24 Maricopa County distributed before and on election day informing the public that 
25 Sharpies were safe to use when marking their ballots?  A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Let's bring up exhibit No. 5, please. 
Dr. Ward, do you recognize this document? 16 
1 
2 
3 
4 Mr. Kolodin. I advise my client to, in addition to asserting her Fifth Amendment 
5 privilege, to also assert the attorney-client privilege. 
6 - Okay. Just to be clear, my question was just whether she 
7 recognized this document, which is a complaint filed in, I believe, State court in Maricopa 
8 County. 
9 The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client 
10 privilege as it applies. 
11 - Dr. Ward, the Arizona Republican Party was a plaintiff in an election 
12 contest lawsuit, along with the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee. 
13 This is a complaint in that case filed on November 7th, 2020. Is that correct? 
14 Mr. Kolodin. I advise my client to assert, in addition to her Fifth Amendment 
15 privilege, the attorney-client privilege. 
16 The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client 
17 privilege. 
18 - Understood. Your objections are noted. Just to be clear, I'm 
19 not asking --none of my questions and certainly not this one will I be asking for any 
20 privileged communication between you and your counsel, merely directed at the fact of 
21 the existence of this lawsuit and the fact that this is the complaint that was filed in 
22 Federal Court --or in State court, forgive me. 
23 This suit centered on allegations relating to the use of Sharpies to mark ballots, 
24 specifically contains allegations of, quote, "ink permeating the paper," end quote. And 
25 it relates to the use of the quote, "green button," end quote, on Maricopa County  1 tabulation devices. 
2 Is that correct? 
3 
4 Mr. Kolodin. Same advice. 
The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege as well as attorney-client 
5 privilege. 
6 BY 17 
7 Q Dr. Ward, have you seen any actual evidence that votes for Trump were not 
8 counted because Sharpies were used to mark ballots? 
9 
10 
11 A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Q Let's bring up exhibit No. 6, please. 
Dr. Ward, this is a tweet. It was posted on November 11th, 2020, by the account 
12 Brahm Resnik, B-r-a-h-m R-e-s-n-i-k. And it has a video embedded in it that we're going 
13 to try to play for you. Here we go. 
14 [Video shown.] 
15 Q Thank you. 
16 Dr. Ward, that video that we just played you that was embedded in the tweet, 
17 exhibit 6, is an interview conducted on FOX News by Arizona Attorney General Mark 
18 Brnovich. Is that correct? 
19 A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
20 Mr. Kolodin. I also advise my client to assert her attorney-client privilege in 
21 response to that question. 
22 
23 The Witness. As well as attorney-client privilege. 
- Understood. Just to be clear, the question was about a public 
24 statement made by the Arizona attorney general. Are you saying that it may implicate 
25 an attorney-client privilege between Dr. Ward and the attorney general?  1 
2 Mr. Kolodin. Same advice. 
The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege as well as attorney-client 
3 privilege. 18 
4 - Okay. In this interview, the attorney general in Arizona stated that 
5 State officials had received approximately 1,000 complaints about the election, but 
6 found, quote, "no evidence of widespread voter fraud." He then stated, "If indeed there 
7 was some great conspiracy, it apparently didn't work," close quote. 
8 Dr. Ward, did you agree with the statement? 
9 
10 
11 The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Mr. Kolodin. I also advise my client to assert the attorney-client privilege. 
The Witness. As well as attorney-client privilege. 
12 - Dr. Ward, were you aware of any information about widespread 
13 voter fraud on or around November 11th, 2020, that was not yet presented in litigation or 
14 to State and local election officials? 
15 
16 Mr. Kolodin. Same advice. 
The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege as well as attorney-client 
17 privilege. 
18 BY 
19 
20 Q Let's bring up exhibit No. 7. 
We will to try to zoom in a little bit. That's great. 
21 So, Dr. Ward, again, these are some text messages that you exchanged with Mark 
22 Meadows, then the White House chief of staff. 
23 On November 11th, 2020, you texted two images to Mark Meadows. Can you 
24 describe those images for us, please? 
25 A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege.  1 Q You then texted a link to the same Twitter post that we showed you in the 
2 previous exhibit, which included the video of the Arizona attorney general being 
3 interviewed on FOX News. Your text accompanying that tweet that you sent to Mr. 
4 Meadows read, "What are these people on 'our side' doing here in Arizona??" followed 
5 by two question marks. 
6 Did you send this text message to Mr. Meadows? 
7 
8 
9 I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Okay. Why did you send that text message? 
I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 19 
10 A 
Q 
A 
Q Dr. Ward, did you think it would be harmful for Republican State officials to 
11 publicly state that they had found no evidence of widespread election fraud? 
12 
13 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
When you sent those text messages to Mr. Meadows, had you seen actual 
14 evidence that the statements made by the attorney general of Arizona were wrong? 
15 Mr. Kolodin. I advise my client, in addition to asserting the Fifth Amendment 
16 privilege, to assert the attorney-client privilege. 
17 The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege, as well as attorney-client 
18 privilege. 
19 The Reporter. Excuse me, counsel, can we get the camera on both of you, the 
20 counsel with the witness in the room, so that we can see you speak? 
21 Mr. Kolodin. Unfortunately, our technical setup doesn't allow for that, at least I 
22 don't know how to do it, so I apologize. 
23 - Maybe we can go off the record for a moment here. 
24 [Discussion off the record.] 
25 - Let's go back on the record now.  20 
1 I want to ask you a few more questions about the complaint that we showed you 
2 in exhibit 5, Dr. Ward. It was a complaint that the caption of the case is the Trump 
3 campaign, Republican National Committee, and Arizona Republican Committee against 
4 Hobbs, et al., in Maricopa County Court. 
5 And this is a lawsuit that was widely referred to as the SharpieGate suit. But on 
6 November 12th, 2020, it was also widely reported that counsel for the plaintiffs in that 
7 case, Kory Langhofer, appeared in court in Maricopa County and stated clearly, quote, 
8 "This is not a fraud case. We are not alleging fraud. We are not alleging that anyone is 
9 stealing the election," end quote. 
10 Do you recall that, Dr. Ward? 
11 
12 Mr. Kolodin. Same advice. 
The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege, as well as attorney-client 
13 privilege. 
14 - Okay. Just to be clear, my question was not directed at any 
15 privileged communication that you may have had as a representative of the Arizona 
16 Republican Party with Mr. Langhofer, but rather what was reported that he said in a 
17 hearing, open hearing, in court. Do you understand that? 
18 
19 
20 Mr. Kolodin. Form. 
- Do you understand the basis of my question? -
The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and my attorney-client 
21 privilege. 
22 
23 - Okay. Thank you. 
As has been publicly reported, during the hearing the defendants in this case 
24 represented that the issues alleged in the complaint affected less than 200 ballots. Is 
25 that correct?  1 
2 Mr. Kolodin. Same advice. 
The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment right and privilege, as well as 21 
3 attorney-client privilege. 
4 - Okay. And following the hearing, lawyers for the Trump campaign 
5 acknowledged that the relief sought in the suit, which was a hand recount of potential 
6 overvotes, would not affect the outcome of the Presidential contest because the margin 
7 of victory was significantly greater than the number of these potential overvotes. 
8 Did you attend or listen to the hearing in that case, Dr. Ward? 
9 Mr. Kolodin. Same advice. 
10 The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and my attorney-client 
11 privilege. 
12 - Okay. Also, as reported after that hearing, the court questioned 
13 plaintiffs' counsel regarding the method of gathering evidence in support of the 
14 allegations, which apparently included some allegations submitted through an online 
15 portal that about which the campaign lawyers were not able to determine their veracity. 
16 Do you recall that reporting about the court's questioning during a hearing in this 
17 case, Dr. Ward? 
18 
19 Mr. Kolodin. Same advice. 
The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client 
20 privilege. 
21 - Were you aware of or involved in these efforts to gather and 
22 investigate evidence in support of the allegations of election fraud raised in this 
23 complaint? 
24 
25 Mr. Kolodin. Same advice. 
The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege, as well as attorney-client  22 
1 privilege. 
2 - On November 13th, 2020, the lawyer representing plaintiffs in this 
3 case, Trump v. Hobbs, Kory Langhofer, filed a Notice of Partial Mootness alerting the 
4 court that, quote, "The tabulation of votes statewide has renderer unnecessary a judicial 
5 ruling as to the Presidential electors," end quote. 
6 Is that correct, Dr. Ward? 
7 
8 Mr. Kolodin. Same advice. 
The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client 
9 privilege. 
10 
11 - Okay. I'd like to show you now exhibit No. 8. 
Okay. These are additional text messages between yourself and Mark Meadows, 
12 then the White House chief of staff, exchanged on November 13th, 2020. 
13 After that hearing, do you recall exchanging a number of text messages with Mr. 
14 Meadows regarding the litigation developments and legal strategy? 
15 Mr. Kolodin. Same advice. 
16 The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege, as well as attorney-client 
17 privilege. 
18 - Just to be clear, Mr. Meadows was at that time the White House 
19 chief of staff, is not a lawyer, to the extent of my knowledge. Are you asserting that 
20 your communications with Mr. Meadows may implicate an attorney-client privilege? 
21 
22 Mr. Kolodin. Same advice. 
The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client 
23 privilege. 
24 - On November 13th, 2020, you sent a link in a text message to Mr. 
25 Meadows. It links to a CNN news article with the headline, "Trump Campaign Drops  1 Arizona Lawsuit Requesting Review of Ballots." 
2 Is that correct? 
3 
4 Mr. Kolodin. Same advice. 
The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client 
5 privilege. 
6 - And at the same time, you sent a text message to Mr. Meadows 23 
7 saying, "WTH?" which I think is an abbreviation for "what the hell?" Is that correct, Dr. 
8 Ward? 
9 
10 Mr. Kolodin. Same advice. 
The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client 
11 privilege. 
12 - In light of the issues that were raised in the hearing in court in 
13 Maricopa County the preceding day, why did you send this article to Mr. Meadows with 
14 the commentary "WTH"? 
15 
16 Mr. Kolodin. Same advice. 
The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client 
17 privilege. 
18 
19 
20 - Okay. Mr. Saunders, if you could scroll down a little bit. 
BY 
Q Dr. Ward, I'd like to direct your attention to the next text message in time 
21 there. Less than an hour later, still on November 13th, 2020, you texted Mr. Meadows 
22 and said, "Just talked to POTUS. He may call the Chairman of the Maricopa Board of 
23 Supervisors (BOS). Want to be sure he's briefed on what to discuss." You then 
24 provided what appear to be some talking points for that discussion. 
25 Do you recall this, Dr. Ward?  24 
I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 1 
2 A 
Q Okay. The talking points that you provide were, "1. BOS has full authority 
3 (and obligation) to ensure integrity of the election in Maricopa County. Because State 
4 law is being ignored in Maricopa as they are unable to verify/hand audit by precinct (as 
5 required by law), a hand count audit of all votes cast in voting centers is necessary." 
6 Did you send that text message, Dr. Ward? 
7 
8 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
These talking points went on. Number 2, "The BOS can ask for increased 
9 hand counting before certifying the election." And number 3, "There are potential 
10 issues with Dominion systems that MUST," in capital letters, "be adjudicated before 
11 certification should ever be considered by BOS." 
12 Did you send this text message to Mr. Meadows, Dr. Ward? 
13 Mr. Kolodin. Same advice. 
14 The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client 
15 privilege. 
16 BY 
17 Q Did you recommend that President Trump call members of the Maricopa 
18 County Board of Supervisors? 
19 
20 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Dr. Ward, why did you recommend that the President of the United States 
21 call members of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors? 
22 
23 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
What was the factual basis for your statement in this text message that 
24 there were, quote, "potential issues," close quote, with Dominion systems that needed to 
25 be adjudicated before certification?  1 
2 Mr. Kolodin. Same advice. 
The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client 
3 privilege. 
4 - Okay. You then asked Mr. Meadows why lawyers in Arizona had 
5 dropped the campaign lawsuit following the 6-hour hearing in Maricopa County State 
6 court. 
7 Do you recall Mr. Meadows' response? 
8 
9 Mr. Kolodin. Same advice. 
The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client 
10 privilege. 
11 - -can you just scroll down a little bit so we can see the next? 
12 That's great. Yeah, keep going a little bit. There we are. Yep. 
13 Dr. Ward, I just wanted to direct your attention to the text messages on 25 
14 November 13th, 2020, with the time stamp 14:25 and 14:26. Mr. Meadows responded 
15 suggesting that there was a concern about a counterclaim for sanctions. 
16 Do you recall discussing this with Mr. Meadows? 
17 Mr. Kolodin. Same advice. 
18 The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client 
19 privilege. 
20 - Dr. Ward, do you think that lawyers for the Trump campaign should 
21 have continued seeking to overturn the election result even after being notified that their 
22 arguments were potentially sanctionable? 
23 
24 Mr. Kolodin. Same advice. 
The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client 
25 privilege.  1 - Just to be clear, my question is not directed at any privileged 
2 communications that you may have had with lawyers that were representing you in this 
3 case, but rather to your impressions of the circumstances then and in connection with 
4 your communications to Mr. Meadows, the White House chief of staff. 
5 
6 Mr. Kolodin. Form. 
The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client 
7 privilege. 
8 - Okay. Let's look at exhibit No. 10, please. And if you could just 
9 scroll down a little bit so we can see the caption. That's great. Thank you. 
10 
11 
12 Q 
A BY-
Dr. Ward, do you recognize this document? 
I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client privilege. 26 
13 Q Okay. This document, exhibit No. 10, is a verified amended complaint filed 
14 in the Superior Court in Arizona for the County of Maricopa. The plaintiff is reflected in 
15 the caption as Kelli Ward. 
16 Is that you? Are you the same person that filed this complaint, Dr. Ward? 
17 
18 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and on attorney-client privilege. 
Okay. This complaint was filed on November 24th, 2020. It was a petition 
19 seeking to block certification of the 2020 Presidential election and require a, quote, 
20 "reasonable inspection," close quote, through sampling of ballots. The court convened 
21 an evidentiary hearing and heard witness testimony in this case. 
22 Is that correct? 
23 
24 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client privilege. 
You were in this case the plaintiff, Dr. Ward, you as the plaintiff, you were 
25 successful in obtaining a sampling review of ballots cast in Maricopa County. Is that  1 correct? 
2 
3 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and on attorney-client privilege. 
Okay. Just to be clear, I'm asking not for any privileged communications 
4 between you and lawyers that represented you in this case, but rather asking as to the 
5 fact that the court ordered and the Maricopa County elections officials participated in a 
6 sampling review during the pendency of this case. Is that correct? 
7 
8 Mr. Kolodin. Form. 
The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client 
9 privilege. 
10 - As is reflected in the decision order issued by the Arizona Supreme 
11 Court on appeal from this case that we have in front of you right now, a total of 1,626 
12 ballots were reviewed and nine errors were identified, seven of which would have been 
13 Trump votes. Is that correct? 
14 
15 The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Mr. Kolodin. I also advise my client to assert the attorney-client privilege. 
16 The Witness. I also assert attorney-client privilege. 
17 - The Arizona Supreme Court in this matter held that, quote, the 
18 "review confirmed the witness testimony that there were mistakes in the duplication 
19 process, the mistakes were few, and when brought to the attention of election workers, 
20 they were fixed." Further, the court held that the error rate was insufficient to call the 
21 election results into question. 27 
22 Your election contest suit in the complaint that we just had before you, Dr. Ward, 
23 it was decided on the merits. Is that correct? 
24 
25 Mr. Kolodin. Same advice. 
The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and my attorney-client  28 
1 privilege. 
2 BY 
3 Q Okay. After receiving this decision order from the Arizona Supreme Court, 
4 did you accept the results of that litigation, Dr. Ward? 
5 
6 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client privilege. 
Okay. Dr. Ward, did you file a cert petition seeking to appeal that decision 
7 to the United States Supreme Court? 
8 
9 
10 A 
Q 
A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client privilege. 
Okay. What was the result in the Supreme Court on the cert petition? 
I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client privilege. 
11 Q I'd now like to bring up exhibit 38, please, which is another video that we'll 
12 play for you, Dr. Ward. 
13 [Video shown.] 
14 - Thank you. 
15 Dr. Ward, in this video posted on or around November 19th, 2020, you discussed 
16 Dominion voting system software. You cited to Sidney Powell, among other sources, 
17 and election night vote dumps in this video message. Is that correct? 
18 
19 Mr. Kolodin. Same advice. 
The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client 
20 privilege. 
21 - Ms. Ward, I'm asking you about your own statements in a video that 
22 was posted to YouTube that we just played for you. So I'm certainly not asking for any 
23 privileged communications that you had between yourself and any lawyer that 
24 represented you. 
25 That being said, let me ask you again, did you discuss Dominion voting system  29 
1 software in that VouTube video posted on or around November 19th, 2020? 
2 Mr. Kolodin. Form. 
3 The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client 
4 privilege. 
5 - This, the video posted on VouTube, also provided a contribution link 
6 that traced back to the Arizona Republican Party's Audit the Vote page. Is that correct? 
7 The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
8 - Dr. Ward, what investigation did you do into the various allegations 
9 that you discussed during this video? 
10 
11 
12 The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Mr. Kolodin. I also advise my client to assert her attorney-client privilege. 
The Witness. As well as attorney-client privilege. 
13 - Dr. Ward, in this video you repeated several claims made by Sidney 
14 Powell, including, for instance, that substantial sums of money had been given to family 
15 members of State officials who bought this software. 
16 What was your understanding of the factual basis for this statement? 
17 Mr. Kolodin. Same advice. 
18 The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client 
19 privilege. 
20 - In this video, Smartmatic is described as a subsidiary of Dominion. 
21 What was your understanding of the factual basis for this statement? 
22 The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client 
23 privilege. 
24 - In fact, Dr. Ward, there are no ties between Smartmatic and 
25 Dominion. Isn't that correct?  1 
2 Mr. Kolodin. Same advice. 
The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client 
3 privilege.

As was later reported by The Washington Post, you received a cease and 
20 desist notice from lawyers representing Dominion. Is that correct?

Have you issued any retraction or any other --of any of the statements that 
23 you made regarding Dominion?

Okay. I'd now like to direct your attention to exhibit No. 12. These are  31 
1 some additional text messages exchanged between yourself and Mark Meadows. And I

10 Why did you provide this individual's name and phone number to Mr. Meadows? 
11 
12 A

You described Mr. Piton as "the algorithm guy." What algorithm are you 
13 referring to here?

15 Q Back in the first text message at the top of this page, which is dated 
16 December 9th, 2020, at 22:11, you --which is about 3 days before you provided the 
17 contact information for Mr. Piton to Mr. Meadows, did you send a text to Mr. Meadows 
18 about a, quote, "guy who says he's cracked the whole election fraud and wants to speak 
19 to someone"? 
20

22 or someone else?

10 contradicting the various allegations of election fraud that were raised by you and 
11 lawyers representing the Trump campaign, RNC, or Arizona Republican Party following 
12 the 2020 election? 
13 
14 Mr. Kolodin. Same advice. 
The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and my attorney-client 
15 privilege. 
16 BY-
17 Q Okay. Let's bring up exhibit 13, please. 
18 Dr. Ward, did you exchange text messages with any members of the Maricopa 
19 County Board of Supervisors following the 2020 election? 
20 
21 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Okay. These are text messages between yourself and Clint Hickman, who 
22 was then chair of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors. They're screenshots, so

Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Mr. Hickman continued in that letter, saying, quote, "The evidence

17 voters with a reliable election." 
18 Do you remember that, Dr. Ward? 
19 
20 A

23 It's Tuesday, November 17th, 7:38 a.m. You texted Mr. Hickman, "Here is Sidney 
24 Powell's number. Please call her."

2 Q BY 
Dr. Ward, before we took a brief recess, we were discussing your 
3 interactions with local officials, in particular, members of the Board of Supervisors in 
4 Maricopa County. 
5 So I just want to ask, in summary, are you going to assert your Fifth Amendment 
6 privilege in response to any questions I would ask you about your communications with 
7 local election officials in Arizona regarding the outcome of the 2020 election? 
8 A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege as well as my attorney-client 
9 privilege. 
10 Q Okay. 
11 I'd next like to ask you some questions about interactions with State officials 
12 following the election. 
13 On November 30, 2020, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey participated in a signing 
14 ceremony certifying the Arizona election results. Do you recall that?

2 Q Exhibit 15 is a tweet by the account @AZGOP posted on November 30, 2020, 
3 the same day that we were just discussing Governor Doug Ducey certified the Arizona 
4 election results. In all capital letters, the tweet reads, "DO NOT CERTIFY A FALSE 
5 ELECTION." 
6 Did you authorize this posting by the Arizona GOP Twitter account, Dr. Ward?

Q Okay. Why did the Arizona Republican Party Twitter account say not to 
9 certify a false election on November 30th?

11 
12 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
I will also direct your attention to exhibit No. 16. 
This is a tweet also from November 30, 2020. It was posted by your Twitter 
13 account, @KelliWardAZ. It responds to a Twitter post on November 30th by the Doug 
14 Ducey Twitter account. And you tweeted in response an abbreviation, "#STHU," which I 
15 believe stands for "shut the hell up," in response to this tweet about the strengths of 
16 Arizona's election system. 
17 Dr. Ward, why did you post this tweet? 
18 
19 
20 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
I'll direct your attention to exhibit No. 17 next. 
This is a full version of the Twitter thread that you were responding to in that 
21 tweet at exhibit 16. It was posted by Arizona Governor Ducey, @DougDucey, on 
22 November 30, 2020, at 9:48 p.m., following his signing of the certification of the election 
23 results in Arizona. You posted this series of tweets defending the integrity of the 
24 Arizona elections. 
25 Do you recall reading these posts?  1 
2 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Okay. 
3 He starts in the first tweet here by saying, quote, "I've been pretty outspoken 
4 about Arizona's election system, and bragged about it quite a bit, including in the Oval 
5 Office. And for good reason." 
6 He continues in the second post, "We've been doing early voting since 1992. 40 
7 Arizona didn't explore or experiment this year. We didn't cancel election day voting as 
8 some pushed for --we weren't going to disenfranchise any voter." 
9 Dr. Ward, did you read these Twitter posts before responding to them on 
10 November 30th? 
11 
12 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Do you agree with Governor Doug Ducey's statement that Arizona has been 
13 doing early voting since 1992? 
14 
15 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Governor Ducey continues in the tweet thread, quote, "In Arizona, we have 
16 some of the strongest election laws in the country, laws that prioritize accountability and 
17 clearly lay out procedures for conducting, canvassing, and even contesting the results of 
18 an election." 
19 Do you agree with that post? 
20 
21 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Governor Ducey continued, quote, "We've got ID at the polls. We review 
22 EVERY signature (every single one) on early ballots --by hand --unlike other states that 
23 use computers. Prohibitions on ballot harvesting. Bipartisan poll observers. Clear 
24 deadlines, including no ballots allowed after Election Day." 
25 Dr. Ward, do you agree with Governor Ducey's summary of Arizona election law  41 
1 and procedures? 
I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 2 
3 A 
Q Were you aware at the time that you made public statements following the 
4 November 2020 election of these election procedures in Arizona?

Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
If we could scroll down a little bit, Governor Ducey actually posts a link to a 
7 provision of Arizona election law relating to the canvass for State offices, amendments, 
8 and measures. It's code provision 16-648. 
9 And then he continues on to explain that the canvass "can ONLY be delayed if 
10 counties DECLINE to certify their results. ALL 15 counties in Arizona --counties run by 
11 both parties --certificated their results." 
12 Dr. Ward, were you aware on November 30th that all counties in Arizona had 
13 certified their results of the Presidential election?

Q In this Twitter post, Christina Bobb writes --reports, essentially, that 
6 "Arizona Speaker of the House Rusty Bowers has closed the Arizona House for a week 
7 'due to COVID."' 
8 She continues, "Sounds like he needs an excuse to give his angry constituents 
9 about why he's refusing to call a session and examine the fraud in his state. First time 
10 it's been closed the whole pandemic." 
11 Then you respond in a tweet, "This is a 100% unnecessary, cowardly move." 
12 Did you post this tweet, Dr. Ward, on December 6, 2020? 
A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Okay. 
I'll direct your attention next to exhibit 19. 45 
13 
14 
15 
16 This is a public statement, a news release, by Arizona Speaker of the House Rusty 
17 Bowers dated December 4, 2020. So it was just 2 days before those posts that we were 
18 looking at in exhibit 18. 
19 In this statement, Speaker Bowers was very clear about the limits of the 
20 legislature's authority in Arizona. He writes, quote, "This week, Rudy Giuliani, Jenna 
21 Ellis, and others representing President Donald Trump came to Arizona with a 
22 breathtaking request: that the Arizona Legislature overturn the certified results of last 
23 month's election and deliver the state's electoral college votes to President Trump. The 
24 rule of law forbids us to do that." 
25 Do you see that statement in exhibit 19, Dr. Ward?  1

3 December 4th, Dr. Ward?

Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Okay. 
Later in this document --if you don't mind scrolling a little bit for me, -it's 
7 the second sentence of the fourth paragraph. There we go. 
8 Dr. Ward, I'd like to direct you to another portion of this statement by Speaker 46 
9 Bowers. He writes, "The U.S. Constitution authorizes each state to appoint presidential 
10 electors 'in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct.' For decades, Arizona 
11 law has required that the voters elect the state's electors on Election Day--this year, on 
12 November 3rd." 
13 Then, a little bit later, he continues, "Nothing in the U.S. Constitution or the 
14 decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court even suggest that the Arizona Legislature could 
15 retroactively appoint different electors who would cast their ballots for different 
16 candidates." 
17 Do you see that portion of Speaker Bowers' statement, Dr. Ward?

Dr. Ward, this is a post you made to Twitter, the account @KelliWardAZ, on  47 
1 January 4, 2021, at 2:01 p.m. You wrote, "I believe the AZ Legislature has the ability & 
2 responsibility to call themselves into session for the purpose of certifying (or decertifying) 
3 this election. Short of that, I urge Gov @dougducey to call the AZ Legislature into 
4 session immediately & not wait for 1/11/21."

18 other capacity. And my question for each of them is whether you spoke with them

On the first page of this memo --if we could scroll down to the second

11 Great. Thank you. 
12 This memo reads, "Assuming the electors pledged to Trump and Pence end up 
13 meeting [in a State] on December 14 to cast their votes, and then send their votes to the 
14 President of the Senate in time to be opened on January 6, a court decision (or, perhaps, 
15 a state legislative determination) rendered after December 14 in favor of the 
16 Trump-Pence slate of electors should be considered timely."

12 Dr. Ward, this is another memo drafted by Kenneth Chesebro to James Troupis. 
13 This one is dated December 9, 2020, and the subject line reflects that it concerns

I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client privilege. 
If we could please look at the beginning of page 3. 
This is under the header "Statutory Requirements for December 14 Electoral 
21 Votes" in a subsection on "STATE LAW." It begins alphabetically, I believe, with Arizona. 
22 It describes the State law requirements and describes Arizona as, quote, "the most 
23 straightforward State," end quote, because it has no additional State law requirements 
24 beyond what is set forth in Federal law. 
25 Is that a correct statement of Arizona law regarding Presidential electors,  1 Dr. Ward?

-if you could just go back to page 2, at the top of the page, please. 
Great.  54 
1 Dr. Ward, on the top of this page, under the header "Certificate of the Votes of 
2 the 2020 Electors from Arizona," it states, "WE, THE UNDERSIGNED, being the duly 
3 elected and qualified Electors for President and Vice President of the United States of 
4 America from the State of Arizona." 
5 Is this a document that you signed and submitted to Federal authorities following 
6 the meeting on December 14, 2020? 
7 
8 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client privilege. 
What was your understanding of the meaning of the language in this 
9 paragraph, "duly elected and qualified"? 
10 
11 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client privilege. 
By signing this document, did you represent that you and the other 
12 Republican electors were the electors, quote, "duly elected and qualified," end quote, 
13 under State law? 
14 
15 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client privilege. 
Dr. Ward, did you have any discussions before the meeting on 
16 December 14th about modifying this language in any way? 
17 
18 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client privilege. 
Did you consider adding language that would indicate that the Republican 
19 electors were in some way contingent? 
20 I can restate my question if you didn't hear it. 
21 
22 A 
Q Okay. Go ahead. 
Okay. Did you have any discussions before December 14th about 
23 modifying the language in the certificate to reflect that the Republican electors were in 
24 any way contingent? 
25 A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client privilege.  1 
2 
3 Q Okay. 
Let's look at exhibit 24 next. 
Dr. Ward, this is a tweet by the Arizona GOP account on Twitter posted on 
4 December 14, 2020. It's a photo with a caption. 
5 Are the individuals in that photo the same ones that we saw sitting around the 
6 table in the video I played for you a moment ago? 
7 
8 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client privilege. 
Okay. 
9 At the top, the caption on this tweet says, quote, "Some person tried to issue a 
10 forged slate of Arizona electors to the National Archives. This was quickly caught and 55 
11 debunked, thank goodness! Vet, oddly, the #FakeNews can't get enough of it. Below 
12 is the only slate of 11 you need to worry about --ignore the 'others."' 
13 Dr. Ward, did you post this tweet on December 14, 2020? 
14 
15 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client privilege. 
Did you believe that the slate of electors for President Biden and Vice 
16 President Harris were a forged slate of electors? 
17 
18 A

23 Q BY-
That's great. Thank you. 
24 Dr. Ward, this is an interview conducted by The Epoch Times of Arizona 
25 Representative Anthony Kern.  1 Was Mr. Kern one of the Republican electors that met on December 14th and 
2 signed the certificates we were looking at a moment ago? 
3 
4 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client privilege. 
In that interview that we just played you, Representative Kern states that, 
5 quote, "On January 6th, Vice President Mike Pence gets a choice on which electors he's 
6 going to choose," end quote. 
7 Did you share that understanding at the time of the meeting of Republican 56 
8 electors on December 14th or right around there, Dr. Ward, that there would be a choice 
9 for Vice President Pence to make? 
10 
11 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client privilege. 
Okay. What was your understanding on December 14 and 15, 2020, of the 
12 role of the Vice President at the joint session of Congress certificating the outcome of the 
13 election? 
14 
15 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client privilege. 
Did you communicate with any members of the Arizona State House or 
16 Senate about the meeting of Republican electors in Arizona? 
17 
18 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client privilege. 
Did you ask any member of the Arizona legislature to take action to 
19 recognize the Republican electors? 
20

Did you communicate with any Members of Congress about the meeting of 
22 Republican electors in Arizona? 
23

6 Republican electors from Arizona? 
7 
8 
9 A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client privilege. 
Q I will direct your attention to exhibit 26, please. 
Dr. Ward, this is a tweet that you posted on January 4, 2021, at 9:18 p.m. It 
10 reads, "I hope our great @VP comes through for us, too. #PrayForPence 
11 #Georgia MAGA." 
12 Did you post this tweet, Dr. Ward? 
I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 57 
13 
14 A 
Q What did you mean when you said you hope that the Vice President "comes 
15 through for us, too"? 
16 
17 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
On this same day, January 4th, did you participate in a call or a 
18 videoconference organized by the Groundswell coalition? 
19 
20 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
This is a call that occurred on that day featuring speakers including yourself 
21 and Newt Gingrich, as well as the executive directors of the House and Senate 
22 conservative caucuses. Do you recall that? 
23 
24 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
The discussion during that call apparently focused on State legislatures 
25 sending alternative slates of electors as the only remaining path forward as of  1 January 4th. Is that accurate? 
2 A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
3 Q Do you know whether the former President wanted alternate electors to 
4 submit electoral college votes in States that he had lost so that the Vice President could 
5 choose them during the joint session of Congress on January 6th? 
6 
7 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client privilege. 
Dr. Ward, are you going to assert your Fifth Amendment privilege in 
8 response to any further questions I would ask you about the alternate slates of electors 
9 or the submission of the electoral votes to Federal authorities, including the National 
10 Archives and the Vice President in his capacity as president of the Senate? 
11 A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client privilege as it 
12 applies. 
13 Q Okay. 
14 Dr. Ward, on November 7, 2020, a "Stop the Steal" rally was held at the Arizona 58 
15 capitol, which then moved to the Maricopa County Recorder's Office, where protests had 
16 been occurring since election day. 
17 Do you recall that? 
18 
19 
20 
21 A 
Q 
A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Did you participate in that protest? 
I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Representative Paul Gosar later stated about this protest that he, quote, 
22 helped organize the very first "Stop the Steal" rally in Arizona. Is that accurate? 
23 
24 
25 A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Q I will direct your attention to exhibit 27 next, please. 
Mr. Kolodin. And after the pending question, we're going to eat some pizza. So  59 
1 we'll need about 10 minutes. 
2 - Okay. Let's finish this question. I will say, though, to the extent it 
3 is helpful to you all --if you want to take a break, that's fine --we are getting close to the 
4 end of our planned questions. So if you wanted to take a shorter break and push 
5 through --
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 Mr. Kolodin. Yeah. We'll just take 10 minutes after you ask this question. 
- Sure. Okay. 
Mr. Kolodin. And I'm on camera. 
- Yeah. Thank you. 
All right. Let's ask the questions about this remaining exhibit, and then we'll take 
11 a brief recess. 
12 BY 
13 Q Okay. Exhibit 27 are a number of tweets, Dr. Ward, that have subsequently 
14 been deleted. They're no longer available to the public. 
15 The first one ---if you don't mind scrolling down a little bit --is on or around 
16 December 8, 2020. The Twitter account of the Arizona Republican Party retweeted a 
17 tweet by Ali Alexander under the hashtag "StopTheSteal." 
18 The original post read, "I am willing to give my life for this fight." And then the 
19 Arizona GOP account stated, "He is. Are you?" 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 Do you see those tweets there, Dr. Ward? 
A 
Q 
A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Did you authorize this posting by the Arizona Republican Party? 
I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
If we can scroll up to the top, there is a further post here, again by the 
25 Arizona Republican Party account, posting a video from the movie "Rambo" and stating,  1 quote, "This is what we do, who we are. Live for nothing, or die for something."

6 Do you see that post in exhibit 27, Dr. Ward? 
A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Mr. Kolodin. All right. Pizza time. 
- Didyou--
Mr. Kolodin. We'll be back in 10 minutes, before you put another question 
7 pending, and look forward to it. Thanks, guys. 
8 - Okay. Let's take a brief recess. We'll come back again at 
9 10 minutes of the hour. Thank you. 
Mr. Kolodin. Thank you. 
[Recess.] 60

11 
12 - Let's go back on the record. It is 4:51 here in Washington. This is 
13 the continued deposition of Dr. Kelli Ward. 
14 BY 
15 Q Before we took a little break, Dr. Ward, we were looking at exhibit 27, so I 
16 want to bring that back up on the screen for you. 
17 So, again, I think before the break I had asked you about these tweets that started 
18 with Ali Alexander with the hashtag "StopTheSteal" and then two subsequent tweets by 
19 the Arizona Republican Party. 
20 My question for you is, did you authorize these posts on or around December 8, 
21 2020? 
22 
23 
24 
25 A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Q Dr. Ward, who is Ali Alexander?

3 A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Q And what did you or the Arizona Republican Party intend to convey by 
4 retweeting this and saying, "He is. Are you?"

10 8:53 p.m. 
11 In this tweet, you were tweeting support for President Trump and stated that you 
12 were, quote, "working every avenue to stop this coup." You ended the post with 
13 "#CrossTheRubicon" and tagged General Flynn, "@GenFlynn."

17 
18 A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Q What is the coup that you referred to in this tweet? 
A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege.

21 
22 
23 
24 
25 A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Q Why did you include the phrase "cross the Rubicon"? 
A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Q Just generally, what does the phrase "cross the Rubicon" mean to you? 
A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Q I would next like to show you exhibit No. 29.  1 The next several exhibits are tweets that you posted around the days leading up 
2 to January 6th. 
3 This first one, exhibit 29, is a tweet from your account, KelliWardAZ, posted 
4 January 4, 2021. Did you tweet this quote, "'It's really 
5 #FightForOurCountry!' --President @realDonaldTrump. We know that when we 
6 #FightForTrump we #FightForAmerica !"?

Q Okay. 
The next document I'd like you to look at is exhibit No. 31, please. 
Dr. Ward, this is another tweet from you on January 5, 2021. It reads --it's 
25 essentially-- it's a post on Twitter encouraging people just to participate in rallies. 62  63 
1 You write, "If you can't make it to DC tomorrow then gather with America-loving 
2 patriots in YOUR state capital. If you can't get to the capital, gather in YOUR town. Let 
3 them hear us ROAR! #StopTheSteal #FightForTrump."

6 Did you tweet this on January 5th, Dr. Ward? 
A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Q What was your understanding of the purpose of encouraging people to rally 
7 in D.C. on January 6th? 
8 
9 A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege.

10 towns on January 6th? 
11 
12 
13 
14 A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Q Okay. 
The next one is exhibit 32, please. 
Dr. Ward, this is another tweet by you, @KelliWardAZ, on January 5, 2021. This 
15 is retweeting a post by the account "Stephanie Hamill" that reports that Apple Maps 
16 would not give directions to D.C. before a pro-Trump rally the following day. And your 
17 tweet says, "Patriots: if you don't have a printed atlas, I think it's time to get one!!" 
18 
19 
20 Did you post that tweet on January 5th, Dr. Ward? 
A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege.

25 A 
Q 
A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Did you speak at a rally at the Arizona State Capitol in Phoenix on January 6, 
I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege.  64 
1 Q At that rally, did you state that the violence that had already occurred that 
2 day in Washington could've been avoided by taking certain steps, including auditing the 
3 results of the 2020 Presidential election? 
I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 4 
5 A 
Q Dr. Ward, do you have any information about the planning of the rally on the

12 
13 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Let's look at exhibit No. 33, please. 
14 Dr. Ward, this is a tweet that you posted, @KelliWardAZ, on January 6, 2021, at 
15 3:30 p.m., so this would've been after the rioters had broken into the Capitol in 
16 Washington. 
17 You retweeted a post by an individual associated with OANN, One America News 
18 Network, I believe. This original post reported that a source close to White House 
19 discussions told OANN, quote, "only reason Pence did not send contested electors back to 
20 respective states was that he believed 'he did not have authority to adjourn congress."' 
21 And then reported, "#StopTheSteal Protesters have adjourned Congress. 
22 Awaiting to hear Pence's current stance." 
23 Do you see that original tweet here, Dr. Ward, in exhibit 33? 
24 
25 A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Q Okay.  65 
1 You then retweeted it, commenting, "Congress is adjourned. Send the elector 
2 choice back to the legislatures." 
3 Did you know about the violence at the Capitol at the time that you tweeted this, 
4 Dr. Ward? 
5 
6 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Were you encouraging Congress to send the outcome of the election back to 
7 the States even after the riot at the Capitol on January 6th? 
8 
9 
10 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
I'll now show you exhibit 34, please. 
This is another tweet that you posted on January 6th about 3 minutes or so after 
11 the previous one that we were just looking at. You tweeted this statement describing 
12 various election integrity measures that you say could have prevented the attack on the 
13 Capitol, I believe, including, quote, "full evaluation of Dominion machines," and then 
14 ending with, quote, "Remember, Democrats refused." 
15 So my first question is, did you tweet this on January 6th? 
16 
17 
18 
19 A 
Q 
A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
What did you mean by including a full evaluation of Dominion machines?

8 A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege as well as attorney-client privilege as 
9 it applies. 
10 
11 Q 
A Okay. What's the attorney-client privilege that is implicated here? 
I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege and attorney-client privilege as it 
12 applies.

19 
20 
21 Mr. Kolodin. Objection to form. 
Thank you. 
- Okay. Thank you. 
Okay. Thank you very much, Dr. Ward. 
22 Based on the objections that we've heard today, including your various assertions 
23 of attorney-client privilege, which we plan to discuss with your attorneys after this 
24 deposition, at this time this deposition will be in recess, subject to the call of the chair. 
25 And we can go off the record.  67

2 fully complied with the subpoena at this point.

4 at this time will be recessed, subject to the call of the chair. 
5 Mr. Mills. You have my objection.
