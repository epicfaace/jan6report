EXAMINATION 
BY 11 
12 
13 
14 
15 Q Then I think where we left off is, yesterday you had started providing 
16 information to the committee about conversations or events where the President had 3 
17 indicated some awareness that he had lost the November 2020 election. And before we 
18 move on to the next topic, I wanted to see if there's anything else on that. 
19 A I think --I think we're good on that section. We got to --yeah, we got to 
20 January 4th. 
21 Q That's right, yeah. We ended on the 4th. 
22 And I understand you have gone back and thought about any additional 
23 conversations or events that also indicate Mr. Meadows and his knowledge that the 
24 President had lost the 2020 election. So I'm hoping you can walk us through those. 
25 A That's correct.  1 The first instance that I would like to discuss would be on Wednesday, 
2 November 25, 2020. And this instance was ahead of the meeting with the Pennsylvania 
3 State legislators that the President convened in the evening on Thanksgiving eve. 
4 
5 Q 
A Okay. Why don't you tell us about that. 
And I know he had a Christmas (ph) meeting as well, but that day, just as a 
6 bit of a refresh, the President was going to --or wanted to travel to Gettysburg. We 
7 pulled down his travel. Mark was going to go in his stead; decided not to go. Then 
8 everything came together where they were able to bring the legislators to the White 
9 House. 
10 That afternoon, it was sort of chaotic, pulling the event together. There were 
11 several different options discussed that the President wanted to do. Mark had a flight 
12 out of Joint Base Andrews that evening to fly down to Plant City, Florida, and he kept 
13 having to push back the flight time because of the meeting that was occurring that night, 
14 and he wanted to be there at least for the first portion of it. 
15 And I was going to handle a lot of the logistics for this meeting because Eliza 
16 Thurston, who was Mr. Meadows' scheduler, was out this day, and there were several 
17 people in the outer Oval that were out as well. 
18 So, towards the evening when the group was about to arrive at the White House 
19 that evening, I had a conversation with Mark when he came back to the office. And we 
20 were just sort of talking about --like, I think I asked him the purpose of why they were 
21 actually convening this meeting. And he was like, who was --I was trying to, like, get 
22 some information on it. 4 
23 And I told Mark that, you know, he had to at least take off that night by 8:00 p.m., 
24 and just logistically because of the flight they would have to switch crews, and then there 
25 would've been a delay. We wanted him on the plane by 8:00 p.m.  5 
1 And he had said to let Eliza know --Ms. Thurston know that there was a chance 
2 that he wouldn't be able to lift at JBA because he wanted to be there for the duration of 
3 the meeting. And I had asked him, you know, "Okay. There's gonna be the other 
4 people here too. Like, I'm happy to go in there. We really want you to go, Mark." 
5 And he had said that he was worried that the President was going to have 
6 conversations with the legislators that arrived that evening about the election and he 
7 thought that that was something that he should have insight on. And I'd asked him 
8 what he meant, and he had said something to the effect of, "The President really thinks 
9 he won the election, and I want to make sure that I'm here for any of these 
10 conversations." 
11 I said, "Well, do you think that he did win the election, Mark?" And he had said 
12 something to the effect of, "Well, I'm not entirely sure if he won the election or if he lost 
13 the election. It looks like we could've won, but we probably lost." 
14 Q Did you follow up with what Mark meant by that? 
15 A I didn't. 
16 Q And I think you shared with us some text messages --I don't have them with 
17 us to show you right now --the text messages about that meeting and various people 
18 who arrived, including Mr. Kerik. 
19 A Correct. I believe I corresponded with Mr. Kerik, Mr. Boris Epshteyn --Mr. 
20 Bernard Kerik and Mr. Boris Epshteyn about the logistics for arrival that day. And I also 
21 have text messages that I turned over to the committee with Ms. [inaudible]. There 
22 might've been another individual as well, but I think --maybe also Mr. Waldron, but I 
23 think it was just Mr. Kerik and Mr. Epshteyn. 
24 
25 Q 
A Were you present for any of the part of the meeting with the legislators? 
I was. I was in and out of the Oval. I was in the Oval prior to their arrival.  6 
1 And then, when they started arriving, I went over to the White House Medical Unit as 
2 some of the legislators and their families began getting tested for coronavirus before they 
3 came over to the West Wing. And then I was definitely at the Oval, like, before they all 
4 went in. There were a few positive tests that popped up in the group. 
5 And after Mr. Meadows went in the Oval for the Oval Office portion of the 
6 meeting --they first convened the meeting in the Cabinet Room, and then the President 
7 brought the group into the Oval Office --I was in there for a few minutes. I wasn't really 
8 listening to anything that closely, because I mostly at that point was trying to get Mark 
9 out, because we were pushing 8 o'clock and I needed him to get to Joint Base Andrews. 
10 When I was in the Oval Office in the first portion, I primarily just heard the 
11 President talking about, you know, what did they think, "they" being the Pennsylvania 
12 State legislators; what were they hearing, "they" being the Pennsylvania State legislators. 
13 And at the time that I was in there, and even at this time, I mean, I wasn't fully 
14 cognizant of what was going on with this State legislator push for the electoral college 
15 and alternate electors. But I mostly just heard banter or just casual conversations of 
16 legislators talking to the President about the potential death votes or things that they 
17 considered fraud, that had been instances of fraud that had been referred to them by 
18 constituents. It wasn't anything that, you know, I found particularly alarming. And I 
19 didn't hear anything, personally, about the President talking about the alternate-elector 
20 scheme. 
21 Now, once Mark left, I left the Oval Office for probably 30, 35 minutes, and then I 
22 realized that the group was still down there with Mr. Giuliani and Ms. Ellis. And I went 
23 down there to try to start breaking it up, because, you know, the President doesn't always 
24 like those meetings to go that long. And at that point they were just taking pictures and 
25 he was wearing (ph), like, "Make America Great Again" hats for them.  1 
2 Q Okay. 
You mentioned "death votes." Are you talking about the allegation of dead 
3 people voting in the election? 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 A That's correct. 
Q All right. 
And, then, you were not there for the whole meeting, it sounds like --
A No, I was not. 
Q --with the President. Okay. 
A No, I was not. And even the portions I was in there, I could overhear a few 
10 things just because I was in the Oval Office, but I was mostly trying to get Mark's 
11 attention to coax him out to let him know that he needed to leave for Florida. 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 Q Okay. 
I'll stop there and see if anybody has any questions on that. 
All right. 
Okay. 
A 
Q So that was November the 26th? Is that right? 
Wednesday, November 25th. 
-5th, I'm sorry. That was the 25th. 
18 What is the next occasion you recall where Mr. Meadows indicated that he knew 
19 the President had lost the election? 
20 A The next instance that I recall where he indicated that the President 
21 probably lost the election was Sunday, December 6, 2020. 
22 
23 Q Why don't you tell us about that. 
A That evening, we hosted a United States Secret Service holiday reception in 
24 the chief of staff's office. He had all of the individuals on his detail there, and I have the 
25 list here. He hosted all the members of his detail in his office prior to the Secret Service 7  8 
1 holiday reception in the residence portion of the White House. 
2 And we had a little cocktail hour before, and then Mr. Meadows arrived with the 
3 detail that brought him there. Everybody came up, and he gave a little speech in his 
4 office prior to bringing the group down to the Oval Office for group photos. 
5 And, you know, he was gracious and was thanking them for everything that they 
6 had done. And I recall Mr. Meadows saying to his agents something to the effect of, 
7 "I've really enjoyed working with you all, and I'm sure that you're going to do great in the 
8 incoming Biden administration." 
9 Q So, in your mind, that suggests the end of the administration and that things 
10 would be moving on? 
11 A In my mind, that was an indication that Mr. Meadows knew that he was not 
12 going to be --that Mr. Trump was not going to be the President after January 20th. 
13 
14 
15 
16 Q 
A 
Q 
A Okay. That list of agents you have there, is that something you made? 
It is. 
Okay. And that lists everybody who you recall being at that meeting? 
There's a few other people on here as well, but this is --yes. And we can go 
17 through it too. There's a few other just random agents that had significance in other 
18 DOJ conversations that we had had, where I posted, like, the contact information for 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 people. 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A But I could identify on this list everybody that was present that evening. 
Was-present? 
And I believe --
He was. 
He was present as well? 
He was present as well. was he also part of the detail?  1 
2 
3 
4 -brought a longtime friend. I believe her first name, I believe, was 
She flew here from California to go with him. And -I brought 
his wife, 
Q Do you remember any other discussions about the election coming up 
5 during that gathering? 
6 
7 
8 A Just amongst the Secret Service, but not that I recall with Mr. Meadows. 
And I'm going to make a note of that. 
Because I recall many of the agents questioning whether Mr. Trump was going to 
9 make an appearance at the holiday party that evening. The President had not been 
10 making many appearances at holiday parties that year. I had heard from colleagues in 
11 the West Wing and, you know, various staffers --like, the military valets or the staffers 
12 that work in the residence --that he did not want to attend the holiday receptions 
13 because he didn't have much to say to all these groups of people and he didn't want to 
14 acknowledge whether he won or lost. But he had always gone to the Secret Service 
15 holiday receptions. 
16 And I wanted to find two more --hang on. I'll circle back on this shortly. I just 
17 want one moment to think about it, because I do remember Mr. Meadows informing his 
18 agents that the President was not coming down that evening, and I remember there 
19 being a little bit more of a conversation about that, but I want to just think about that 
20 before I give further information on it. 
21 Q Okay. And what you're going to think about is whether the President 
22 attended? 9 
23 A No. I'm going to think about other conversations Mr. Meadows would have 
24 had with his agents that night, and it's regarding the President's attendance that evening. 
25 Q Okay. Thank you.  A 
Q I apologize for not being clear. 
No, I think that was on my end, frankly. 
Do you remember if the President did show up? 10 
1 
2 
3 
4 A He did not, to the best of my recollection. I'm confident he did not go that 
5 evening. 
6 Q Did anybody else from White House staff, so other than the agents, attend 
7 that party? 
8 
9 A Not that I recall seeing. 
The Director of the Secret Service was there. Obviously, he's not White House 
10 staff. But he stood downstairs at the base --so there's the main staircase if you're on 
11 the ground level of the White House residence. He was standing near the marble 
12 staircase going up. And he was standing there with Mr. Engel and Mr. Cho, David Cho. 
13 Ms. Cheney. So I'm just asking to make sure. So the holiday reception was for 
14 Secret Service broadly, for people that were associated with the White House --
15 
16 Ms. Hutchinson. The Presidential Protective Division. 
Ms. Cheney. Okay. And then this list that you have, what you're thinking about 
17 is a smaller reception beforehand in Mark's office. 
18 
19 
20 Ms. Hutchinson. Correct. 
Ms. Cheney. Okay. 
Ms. Hutchinson. We had, I believe --I could fine-tune the timing and just go back 
21 and look. But probably around 4:30 or 5:00, we invited everybody to come into the 
22 West Wing chief of staff's office, and then we had a reception in his office. Mr. 
23 Meadows brought the group to the Oval Office to take photos, and then he escorted the 
24 group over to the White House residence, to the State Floor --excuse me --for the White 
25 House-hosted holiday reception.  1 And then, after the White House holiday reception ended, Mr. Meadows had 
2 already left, but he had asked me to escort the group back to his West Wing office and 
3 had invited the group to stay there as long as they wanted that evening. 
Ms. Cheney. Okay. And "the group" was his detail? 
Ms. Hutchinson. It was his detail. 
And then we also invited the PPD, Presidential Protective Division, leadership. 11 
4 
5 
6 
7 He invited Mr. Bobby Engel; who was a GS-15. He was 
8 the technical head of Mr. Meadows' detail. He had jurisdiction over Mr. Meadows' 
9 detail and Mr. Kushner and Ms. lvanka Trump's detail. He is now down in Florida on the 
10 former President's detail. 
11 
12 Ms. Cheney. Okay. 
Ms. Hutchinson. And we also invited_, who was the special agent in 
13 charge of access control. 
14 
15 Ms. Cheney. Okay. 
Ms. Hutchinson. -did not attend that evening, though. But Mr. 
16 Engel, attended the holiday reception in Mr. Meadows' office 
17 that evening. But I don't recall them being present when Mr. Meadows arrived. 
18 
19 Ms. Cheney. And Mr. Ornate? 
Ms. Hutchinson. Mr. Ornate was at the White House earlier that evening. 
20 don't recall seeing him on the State Floor, though. 
21 
22 Ms. Cheney. Okay. 
Ms. Hutchinson. I believe he was at the White House for a separate matter and 
23 had left. But I could be wrong on that. I just --I don't recall him attending either the 
24 reception at Mr. Meadows' office or the holiday reception in the residence. 
25 Ms. Cheney. Okay. Thank you.  12 
BY 
Q Anything else about that event? 1 
2 
3 A Other than the one instance where I wanted to give more thought to that I'll 
4 circle back on in a little while. 
5 Q Okay. Very good. 
6 Any additional times that Mr. Meadows indicated that he knew that the President 
7 had lost? 
8 
9 
10 A The next instance that I have is Wednesday, December 9, 2020. 
Q Tell us about that. 
A Mr. Meadows and I went to the National Archives. And I'm going to 
11 mispronounce the individual's last name. He met with the head of the National 
12 Archives, Mr. David Ferriera. 
13 
14 Q Okay. 
A I did not sit in on that meeting, but I understood the purpose of that 
15 meeting, for Mr. Meadows to discuss the future Presidential library with --I really don't 
16 know how to pronounce his last name. 
17 
18 Q The Archivist? 
A The Archivist. Thank you. I understood the purpose of that meeting, for 
19 Mr. Meadows to discuss the future Presidential library with the Archivist and discuss the 
20 document-retention protocol for the end of the administration. 
21 I went to the Archives with him. I just sat outside of the office during that 
22 meeting. And then when the meeting finished and Mr. Meadows and I walked out, I had 
23 a few things that I had to ask him. And we were just in the motorcade going back to the 
24 West Wing, or going back to the White House. 
25 And I had asked Mark whether he thought that the President --or I asked if the  13 
1 President knew that he was meeting with the Archivist. And he had said, "No, he 
2 doesn't. I'll probably tell him later this afternoon. The President probably will not be 
3 that happy with me about meeting with him, though. He doesn't want us to keep 
4 working on a post-election period yet." 
5 And I had asked Mr. Meadows why. And he said, "There are still pending 
6 lawsuits out there, and the President has very strong feelings about how things should be 
7 handled." And I asked Mark, "Well, how do you think things should be handled?" And 
8 he said, "Well, I had the meeting." He said something to the effect of, "Well, I had the 
9 meeting, didn't I?" 
10 I understood that comment to mean that Mr. Meadows knew it was the right 
11 thing to do, to begin having meetings discussing an end of the Trump administration, but 
12 also that he needed to keep also trying to balance the interests and ensure that the 
13 President wasn't going to get angry at him. He was sort of trying to do this a little bit 
14 more quietly. 
15 
16 Ms. Cheney. Cassidy, do you know if anybody else was in that meeting? 
Ms. Hutchinson. I don't believe there was anybody else in that meeting. The 
17 Archivist may have had an aide in the meeting, but I did not see anybody else walk into 
18 his office that day except for Mr. Meadows and the Archivist. 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 Ms. Cheney. Okay. 
Ms. Hutchinson. And I was there. I sat right outside the office with 
who was the ASAIC of Mr. Meadows' detail. 
Ms. Cheney. Okay. 
BY 
Q What does that acronym mean? I'm sorry. 
A It's the assistant --1 forget what the --I'll remember that. I was literally just  14 
1 thinking, what does the T stand for? Oh, I think just assistant special agent in charge. 
Okay. 2 
3 Q 
A He was the 14. Here, in Mr. Meadows' immediate detail, he was the most 
4 senior member of his detail. And then we had four shift leaders: 
5 
6 Q and towards the end we had 
Okay. 
7 Any other instances that you've gone back and thought about Mr. Meadows 
8 indicating knowledge of loss? 
9 A The next instance that I would like to share with the committee is on 
10 Monday, December 14, 2020. 
11 Q All right. Tell us about that. 
12 A I recall this day being the day that the electoral college had certified the 
13 results of the election. And Mr. Meadows and I had a private conversation in his office 
14 this evening discussing a potential move to Florida. 
15 Mr. Meadows and I had a conversation about moving to Florida on Wednesday, 
16 November 18, 2020, and I don't recall discussing it with him, at least at length, in this 
17 interim period of time. But on Monday, December 14, 2020, he called me into his office 
18 before he left the White House that evening and asked if I still would be interested in 
19 moving to Florida. 
20 I said I would think about it. What was he thinking? Had he had any 
21 discussions with the President? He said, "I have not talked to the President about this 
22 yet, but if you're willing to move down to Florida, I'll add you on the list. I think that you 
23 should start planning on moving down to Florida. Are you in an apartment lease right 
24 now?" 
25 So we started having, like, just a very top-line, basic conversation about logistically  1 what it would entail, moving to Florida in about 36 days. And then he left for the 
2 evening. 
3 Q Did he say anything about ongoing challenges to the election, whether in 
4 court or through the electoral college, that you can remember? 
5 
6 
7 A 
Q 
A Not that I can recall in this specific conversation. 
And --
1 knew that he still was having conversations, but in this specific 
8 conversation it was purely logistical. Because he also had a conversation with 
9 Mr. Michael Haidet, who was the President's scheduler, either before or after me, 15 
10 because I remember talking to Mr. Haidet about the conversation he had with Mark after 
11 I had the conversation with Mark and after Mark left that evening. Because Mr. Haidet 
12 originally was going to move down to Florida with Mr. Trump as well. 
13 
14 Q 
A Did he end up not going? 
He ended up not moving to Florida, correct. He was going to move to 
15 Florida and then around January 7th or January 8th he decided not to. 
16 Q Is that because, at least so far as you understand, anything that happened on 
17 January 6th? 
18 A In my conversations with Mr. Haidet, he let me know, because I --I think I 
19 should back up. 
20 I had a conversation with Mr. Haidet the day of January 6th and then just a few 
21 days after January 6th about how I was having second thoughts about moving to Florida. 
22 And I had also learned that Mr. Haidet had decided not to move to Florida himself. So I 
23 had asked Mr. Haidet if it was because of January 6th. 
24 He always was sort of on the fence about moving to Florida anyway, for similar 
25 reasons that I was. But the way that he described his decision to me was that it wasn't  16 
1 because --he didn't make the decision not to move to Florida because of what happened 
2 on the 6th, but it made the decision easier. The 6th made his decision easier. 
3 Q Give me just a moment on something. 
4 Did we talk in the past about Mr. Meadows and his role in the certification --or, 
5 excuse me, sending electors, Republican electors, to vote in States that Mr. Trump had 
6 lost? 
7 A I believe we have discussed that. But, to be frank, I started paying more 
8 attention to all of this after the alternate-elector --
9 
10 
11 Q 
A 
Q Uh-huh. 
--theories --I don't even know what to call it. But --
And I guess I'm just wondering, do you remember him coordinating with 
12 State party chairs or anything about having electors cast votes? 
13 A I remember Mr. Meadows frequently asking for contact information for 
14 State legislators. I had a master contact sheet of all the State Governors and the 
15 attorney generals of each State, so he frequently would ask me for those contacts. We 
16 always would input those contacts into this contact list --which I actually think I have that 
17 as well --but sometimes he would just want it texted to him so he could call it right away. 
18 But I also recall him having conversations with Members of Congress asking for 
19 contact information for individuals in States. But I ----when I remember this, I 
20 remember it more as background noise, because I wasn't paying attention, really, to --to 
21 be frank, I didn't really know the purpose of why he was asking for it. I assumed he was 
22 asking for the contact information to make the calls. I didn't have insight on any of the 
23 calls. 
24 Q Okay. And you mentioned State legislators. Is that what you primarily 
25 recall -- 1 
2 
3 A Primarily. 
Q --him asking for contact information? 
A Primarily. And a few State attorney generals. And if I saw their names, I 
4 probably would recognize who it was, but I can't name anybody off the top of my head, 
5 unless I have it on my contacts sheet here. 
6 Q Maybe during our break you could do that, look through that and see if 
7 there's anything there. I'll make a copy as well. 
8 Are there other instances that you recalled about Mr. Meadows indicating 
9 knowledge of loss of the election? 
10 A The next instance that I would like to present to the committee occurred 
11 Thursday, December 17, 2020. 
Q Okay. What happened then? 17 
12 
13 A This was a fairly brief exchange I had with Mr. Meadows. He was supposed 
14 to go over to the residence of the White House; there was a holiday reception with the 
15 White House Military Office. And Mr. Ornate was over at the White House Military 
16 Office holiday reception. So I was going to escort Mr. Meadows to meet up with 
17 Mr. Ornate at the holiday reception. 
18 And, again, I don't know if they knew definitively that evening that Mr. Trump was 
19 not going to attend or if they had speculated that he wasn't going to attend that holiday 
20 reception, but Mr. Meadows and Mr. Ornate wanted there to be a bunch of senior 
21 staffers present, at least, to show thanks to the staffers that were at the reception that 
22 evening. 
23 Mark abruptly left the White House that evening, even though we had planned for 
24 him to attend that holiday reception. And I walked him out of the West Wing that night, 
25 and I recall him saying something to the effect of, "I just can't do this right now. I had a  1 real bad day with the boss. He's so mad at me because we lost." 
Who is "the boss" in that? 
"The boss" was referring to the President, the former President. 
And you said that was on December the 17th? 
Thursday, December 17, 2020. 18

Q Not that I can recall. 
Any other instances? 
Oh, I'm sorry. 
- Go ahead. I'll go after you. Finish your line of questions. 
- That was it for this one, so if you have --
BY-: 
Q I was just wondering, do you remember Mr. Meadows making any 
15 statements or talking about the GSA ascertainment and the role of GSA in doing that? 
16 
17 
18 
19 A 
Q 
A 
Q I might be a little gone for a second. Could you -Â­
Sorry. Yeah. So --
Ascertain? 
So the GSA, the General Services Administration --the Administrator of GSA 
20 makes an ascertainment of when the election is won in order to start the transition. 
21 
22 
23 A 
Q 
A So that was when --1 believe her name was Emily? 
Emily Murphy. Right. 
Emily Murphy. 
24 I remember Mr. Meadows having conversations with Chris Liddell about that, 
25 especially towards the end of November, because that's when I remember --now, I could  19 
1 be a little off on my timeline on that. I'd have to go back and look at the dates. But I 
2 remember Mr. Meadows having conversations with Mr. Liddell about starting that 
3 protocol and, like, switching that into place. 
4 And I know that Mr. Meadows --1 am under the impression that Mr. Meadows 
5 delegated himself as the representative on behalf of the President to discuss post-White 
6 House plans with GSA. And I had documentation, because I also was going to move 
7 down to Florida, where I would might --I'd have to look and see. But there are 
8 documents where he had to sign himself as the delegate, and then we had to give the 
9 same paperwork to the Vice President's office. And I remember asking Mr. Short to sign 
10 it, because I was under the impression by Mr. Meadows that Mr. Short was the delegate 
11 for the Vice President. 
12 Q But you think the President delegated Mr. Meadows as that --to serve in 
13 that role? 
14 A I don't know whether Mr. Trump delegated Mr. Meadows to serve in that 
15 role or whether Mr. Meadows volunteered or suggested that he should serve in that role 
16 and the President accepted that. 
17 
18 
19 
20 Q 
Q 
A Okay. 
BY 
Okay. So after the 17th are there any other occasions? 
So this occasion straddled, I think, a bit --and it could be moot, but I just 
21 think it's worth mentioning anyway. But I was looking back in my text messages when I 
22 was putting together these lists, and this exchange kind of straddles two dates. The first 
23 date would be Thursday, December 24, 2020, and the second date would be --I don't 
24 know what day --December 31st, which I think was a Friday. 
25 Q Who were the text messages with that are helping you remember this?  1 
2 
3 A 
Q 
A 20 
Mr. Ornate. 
Okay. All right. Tell us about what you remember. 
So I had texted Mr. Ornate on December 31st, and I don't have them in front 
4 of me, but essentially we were talking about --I think I asked Mr. Ornate if Mr. Trump had 
5 spoken with Margo Martin, who was a press assistant in the White House and is now 
6 working for Mr. Trump in Florida. 
7 Margo had reached out to me, and I don't remember if it was in person or on a 
8 phone call, but Margo had reached out to me and asked if I knew anything about the 
9 transition to move down to Florida. And I was a little surprised that she had asked me 
10 about this because she had said --well, I don't remember exactly what I said to her, but I 
11 said something along the long the lines of, "Why?" or "I don't know." So I think I just 
12 tried to kind of yield off the conversation. 
13 And she let me know that the President called her on Christmas Eve and 
14 instructed her to talk to Jared Kushner because Jared had insight into the 
15 post-Presidential operation and the President wanted to make sure that Margo was on 
16 the list to move down to Florida with him on January 20th. 
17 What refreshes my recollection on this was a text exchange I had with Mr. Ornate 
18 where I'd asked whether the President spoke with Margo on Christmas Eve, 
19 December 24, 2020, and Mr. Ornate could not find a record of that call in the President's 
20 call logs. And I had asked Mr. Ornate in the text chain, "Is there a chance it wouldn't 
21 show up?" or something to that effect, and he said, "Not unless he called off somebody 
22 else's phone or his private cell phone. Then it wouldn't show up in the White House call 
23 logs." And I had a brief exchange with Mr. Ornate about what Margo had talked to me 
24 about. 
25 And then I caught Mr. Meadows before he left that evening. I believe that  21 
1 evening he went to the --he did --he went to the Salamander Resort. And I let Mr. 
2 Meadows know that Margo had reached out to me about the post-Presidential operation 
3 and the call she said she had with the former President on Christmas Eve. And he said 
4 something to the effect of, "Oh, gosh, I didn't realize that he was already making these 
5 calls. All right, well, maybe that means that I can actually move forward and make plans 
6 for the post-Presidential period. Now I'll have to have a conversation with him." 
7 And then I remember, we were walking out that evening. He asked me if I 
8 thought it would be wise if Margo moved down to Florida with him, and I said, "I think 
9 that's a conversation you should have with the President." He said, "Would you want 
10 her to move down to Florida with you guys on the 20th?" And I said, "I don't really have 
11 any dogs in that fight," or something to that effect. 
12 Q Did you ever talk to Ms. Martin about her move to Florida or potential move 
13 to Florida and conversations she had with the President? 
14 A She reminded me a few times about that Christmas Eve conversation. 
15 don't recall seeing her back at the White House, though, until --and I could be off on this. 
16 I don't remember seeing her back at the White House until January 4th --Monday, 
17 January 4, 2021. She traveled with us to Florida --or, I'm sorry. Margo traveled on Air 
18 Force One round-trip to the Georgia rally that evening. But in the period between 
19 Monday, December 14th, and whenever she went --I remember she went to Texas for 
20 Christmas that year --she raised it with me a few times, because she knew that I also had 
21 a conversation a while ago with the President. Somehow she was aware the President 
22 had also asked me to move down to Florida --and with Mr. Meadows. But for some 
23 reason she thought that Mr. Kushner was running point on the post-Presidential 
24 operation. 
25 So I remember she asked me a few clarification questions in, like, that  22 
1 week-and-a-half time period after December 14th. But I don't recall her really detailing 
2 any conversations with the President until the December 14th benchmark. 
3 
4 Q Okay. 
Ms. Cheney. Cassidy, the text message with Mr. Ornate where he mentioned the 
5 President's private cell phone, is that something that you have already turned over to the 
6 committee, or is that something you were recalling? 
7 
8 
9 Ms. Hutchinson. I believe so, although -Â­
Ms. Cheney. Okay. 
Ms. Hutchinson. --I think we're going to look back and make sure that 
10 everything is turned over there. Because I was just scrolling through --no, I believe I 
11 screenshotted everything that was relevant to it. Like, I wasn't scrolling through my 
12 screenshots when I saw these texts. I was just scrolling through my actual text thread 
13 with Mr. Ornate. 
14 
15 
16 
17 Ms. Cheney. Okay. If you guys can check. And we'll check also. 
Ms. Hutchinson. Yeah. 
Ms. Cheney. Okay. 
Ms. Hutchinson. I don't know if he meant --just because I don't have it in front 
18 of me too --I don't know if he meant, like, a private cell phone that the President had or if 
19 maybe it was a private cell phone that belonged to the White House. I don't know, 
20 like --
21 
22 Ms. Cheney. Yeah. 
Ms. Hutchinson. --what the White House Communications Agency protocol is 
23 for that, like, if maybe he had a private cell phone that --I just don't know. 
24 
25 Ms. Cheney. Okay. 
BY  1 
2 Q 
A Okay. So that was end of December. Anything else? 
Yeah, it was December 24th and 31st. 
3 There is one that I would like to just reiterate really briefly that we talked about 
4 yesterday, and I just want to add it in here, is the Saturday, January 2, 2021. 
That was after the Raffensperger call? 23 
5 
6 Q 
A After the Raffensperger call, where Mark said something to the effect of, "He 
7 knows it's over" --the "he" I am referring to when I say this quote is the President, 
8 President Trump. Mark said something to the effect of, "He knows it's over. He knows 
9 he lost. But we're going to keep trying. There's a chance he didn't. I want to pull this 
10 off for him." 
11 Q Is that based --that's based on your recollection of the conversation, not a 
12 text message or --
13 
14 
15 A 
Q 
A That's based on my recollection of my conversation with Mr. Meadows. 
Okay. 
Because then, soon after we had that conversation --again, it was really 
16 brief. And soon after that conversation, Mr. Cipollone came downstairs to have a 
17 private, closed-door conversation with Mr. Meadows. 
18 
19 
20 
21 Q 
A 
Q 
A And I believe that was a Saturday, right? 
Saturday, January 2, 2021. 
Okay. Anything else? 
The final instance I would like to share with you all occurred on Sunday, 
22 January 3, 2021. 
23 Q All right. Tell us about that. 
24 A On Sunday, January --and I believe we also spoke about this either in the 
25 first or the second interview, and we might have touched on it yesterday --we did; we  24 
1 touched on it yesterday as well --referencing the words that you said referred to 2020 for 
2 the President to potentially acknowledge that he had lost. 
3 But this instance here, Sunday, January 3, 2021, Mr. Meadows raised with me the 
4 issue of the President's children getting United States Secret Service protection in the 
5 post-administration period, post-Presidential period. I had both sheets the Staff Sec had 
6 drafted --I asked that the Staff Secretary had drafted, one entitling the children to 
7 6 months of protection, the other entitling the children to 1 year of protection. 
8 Prior to the DOJ meeting convening that evening in the Oval Office with the 
9 President, Mark asked me for both of those sheets. And he took the 1-year one, the 
10 1-year-protection sheet. And I told Mark, "Mark, I really think you need to think about 
11 this." And he had said, "No. I want him to sign this. This is going to make him happy. 
12 I don't want him to keep being mad at me over this." And I said, "Mark, can we just talk 
13 about this?" And he just put it down on my desk and then went into his office, came 
14 back, and said, "Can I just have both of them?" So I said, "Sure." I handed him both of 
15 the sheets. 
16 A few moments later, he came back down, handed me both sheets. Both 
17 sheets --6 months, 1 year --were signed by the President. And I said, "Which one does 
18 he want to go forward with?" And he said, "Whatever one you think is best." And I 
19 said, "I think 6 months of protection is best." And he said, "Well, he wants 1 year." 
20 And I had said to Mark, "Well, which one do you think is best?" He said, "I don't 
21 really care about" --he said something to the effect of, "I don't really care about this 
22 anymore. I'm just tired of hearing that we lost the election. I don't really know if we 
23 won, I don't really know if we lost, but he's putting so much pressure on me to pull this 
24 off in a couple of days. There's a million things going on." And then he just went into 
25 his office and shut the door.  25 
1 Q Just to clarify some of that, you said that the President said, "Whichever one 
2 you think is best," meaning whichever one Mr. Meadows --
3 
4 
5 A Whichever one --
Q --thought was best. 
A Yes. And then when Mr. Meadows came back to talk to 
6 me --Mr. Meadows knew I had been corresponding with Mr. Ornate about this. To the 
7 best of my knowledge, Mr. Meadows knew that both Mr. Ornate and I thought the 
8 6-month protection was appropriate. And when he came back and said, "Whichever 
9 one you think is best," I understood that as Mr. Meadows attempting to delegate the 
10 decision to me or to Mr. Ornate. 
11 Ms. Cheney. But the President had signed both of them. 
12 Ms. Hutchinson. He had signed both of them. 
13 BY 
14 
15 Q What happened with those documents, if you know? 
A The documents sat in my desk, my top left desk drawer, until after the 6th. 
16 And the 6-month was submitted to Staff Sec. I don't remember the date that it was 
17 submitted to the Office of the Staff Secretary. And I don't recall what happened to the 
18 1-year-protection document. 
19 I believe --what I believe happened --and I --to the best of my recollection, I 
20 believe it would've been January 7th or January 8th, Mark would've asked me for those 
21 documents. And sometimes he would walk things down to Staff Sec by himself, and he 
22 would come back with up with the same folder [inaudible] with, like, executive orders, 
23 that, like, the Staff Secretary wasn't going to bring them up. 
24 We didn't have a head Staff Secretary at this point, so Mark was doing a lot of the 
25 paper shuffling between the Office of the Staff Secretary and the Oval Office. And a lot  26 
1 chimes, he would just bring papers back and forth and leave whatever else he found 
2 outstanding in his office. So I believe that he had walked both down to the Office of 
3 Staff Secretary at one point and would have brought back up the 1-year and kept that one 
4 in his office. 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 Q Because that was the one the President did not choose? 
A That's the one the President did not choose. 
Ms. Cheney. Or --
Ms. Hutchinson. Well, that's the one that -Â­
Ms. Cheney. Didn't get submitted. 
Ms. Hutchinson. --was not submitted. I apologize. Thank you. 
BY 
Q Okay. Anything else on that? 
A That's it from my current recollection. If I remember anything else, I'll 
14 share it with you all. 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 Q Okay. 
Any other instances related to Mr. Meadows or the President? 
A No, sir, not that I can recall. If I think of any more, I'll be sure to --
Q Okay. 
Any questions on that? 
No. 
BY-: 
Q And I think the next area we'd like to explore is, we received from Mr. Hunt a 
23 document. It's in your binder as exhibit 55. And that describes two occasions where 
24 others --Mr. Ornate, Mr. Engel --
25 A I have it. If you could hold on to that -- 27 
1 Q So this document, exhibit No. 55, talks about conversations that you had or 
2 overheard, the first being on January 19, 2021, in the White House, and the second being 
3 April 16, 2021, with Mr. Ornate. 
4 Have you read this document? 
5 
6 
7 A 
Q 
A I have, but mine was a little different. Can I see yours? 
Yeah. Take as much time as you need. 
Oh, okay. Okay. I had my formatting different. Yes, I do recognize this 
8 document. I'm just trying to --because mine was formatted differently, so I'm trying to 
9 re-accustom myself to this one. 
10 
11 Q Yes, absolutely. And take as much time as you need. 
I want to talk to you about both of those incidents. So the first one that's 
12 described here in this document is on January 19th in the White House involving Mr. 
13 Engel, Mr. Meadows, and some family members. 
14 Can you tell us what you recall about that?

12 The document goes on and talks about a phone conversation that you had had 
13 with Mr. Ornate, it looks like on April the 16th. 
A Uh-huh. 
Q Can you tell us a little bit about that? 30 
14 
15 
16 A So I was in New Jersey, I don't recall for how long I had been there, but, you 
17 know, in the months after we left the White House. I was having a hard time, you know, 
18 one, I think readjusting back into what I refer to as normal life. 
19 But, two, there's a lot that happened during my tenure at the White House in the 
20 year 2020, but specifically in the months of November to January. And I think living it at 
21 that speed, you don't really, at least for me, I didn't understand what was happening all 
22 the time because we were going and going and going. So in the months after we left the 
23 White House, it was this massive decompression period for me. 
24 And there would be some days where, like, I'd really miss being at the White 
25 House. I wished that we had won the election. But then there would be some days  31 
1 where the magnitude and the toll of the stress from this period would settle in and I was 
2 just kind of like I didn't really have anybody to talk to about any of it. Liz Horning was 
3 probably the person I spoke with the most because she was also having a hard time. 
4 But I had spoke --Mr. Ornate and I kept in touch. And I remember this day. 
5 was in New Jersey and I was just having a really hard day. And I don't remember if there 
6 was a specific instance that triggered me having a really hard day, but I just --I remember 
7 waking up that morning and just feeling like this heaviness with everything that happened 
8 in that period. 
9 And I knew that Tony would be somebody that I could talk to because Tony and I 
10 did confide in each other about a lot of things working at the White House. So this was 
11 when I had messaged him. 
12 I had left my parents' house. I was driving to a consignment shop in Burlington, 
13 New Jersey. I had texted him and asked if he was at work. He had said yes. The text 
14 message is here. 
15 And as I was driving to the consignment shop in Burlington, New Jersey, 
16 Mr. Ornate and I had probably --probably it was like a 30 --about 20 minutes. Yeah, I 
17 would say 20 or 30 minutes, because the consignment shop is 30 minutes away from my 
18 parents' house. 
19 And we talked about a variety of things on the call, you know. I asked him --and 
20 we talked about a lot of this before we left the White House too --but I had asked 
21 him --I felt like there was more that we could have done. I felt like we could have 
22 done more to stop some of these events. 
23 And, you know, Tony would do this at the White House too. He knew that I 
24 overthought some things. But he was reassuring me, after what happened in --on that 
25 car, I remember him reassuring me that we, being me and Tony, did everything that we  32 
1 could do. We had conversations with Mr. Meadows about movements at the Capitol. 
2 We had conversations with other people internally about not allowing those movements 
3 to happen. We had had conversations while I was on the ground at the rally on 
4 January 6th. 
5 He said, "We did everything that we could do. You have nothing to worry about. 
6 You have no reason to bear any of the blame for this. It's mob mentality. This would 
7 have happened whether we had the rally, whether we didn't have the rally." 
8 And he would make sarcastic offhand remarks. Like, "Cass, don't you remember 
9 what happened in the summer of 2020 with the Black Lives Matter protests? Violence 
10 breaks out when you have big groups of people. This isn't a new thing." 
11 So, you know, by the end of the conversation, I remember feeling --I do 
12 remember feeling a little bit better, because I do have a tendency to blame myself for 
13 things. And I was --I think a little bit too I hadn't spoken to Mr. Meadows. I couldn't 
14 speak about any of this to Mr. Meadows. 
15 And at this point too I was kind of shuttling with how I felt about him. And I like 
16 pulled up to the shop and I let him know. And he gotten to the training facility in 
17 Maryland. 
18 And I remember when he hung up the phone he said something to the effect of 
19 well, "All right, well, chin up kid. Let's talk soon. It could be worse. The President 
20 could have tried to kill" --he didn't say kill. "The President could have tried to strangle 
21 you on January 6th." 
22 And I remember just laughing and being like, "That's true. At least he didn't try 
23 and do that." 
24 
25 And he said, "All right. Well, touch base with me in a couple days. We'll chat." 
Q Did you ever talk to Mr. Meadows --or, Mr. Ornate, excuse me --again  33 
1 about references to the President strangling or assaulting anybody? 
2 A On January 6th we had the conversation, and on April 16th we had that 
3 conversation. 
4 
5 
6 
7 Q 
A 
Q 
A Okay. So no other conversations that you can remember? 
No. Not to my recollection. 
And --
And just to be fair, again, as I did with Mr. Engel, he did not specify when he 
8 made that sarcastic offhand remark at the end of our phone conversation that he was 
9 referencing what happened in the Presidential SUV on January 6th. 
10 I assumed from the context of our phone call and from the conversations that we 
11 had had while still at the White House that he was referencing that incident. I have no 
12 reason to believe that he was referencing any other incident. But he didn't specify. 
13 So --
14 Q You anticipated my question perfectly. I was going to ask you how you 
15 understood it in light of the conversation that you relayed to us. 
16 And then, in attachment B to this exhibit, exhibit 55, it's a screenshot apparently 
17 of messages that you had with Mr. Ornate over Signal. Is that right? 
18 
19 A 
Q Uh-huh. 
And there is a call referenced in the middle or communicated in the middle 
20 on April 16th at 14:12. 
21 Is that the call that you believe was the one with Mr. Ornate where you talked 
22 about what you just mentioned? 
23 
24 A 
Q That is the call. 
Other than Mr. Ornate, Mr. Meadows, what you just described to us, do you 
25 remember talking about the incident that occurred in the vehicle as you've relayed it with  34 
1 anybody else who worked in the White House or any other Secret Service agents? 
2 A The phone call would have been probably close to 15 minutes. I'm looking 
3 at the time the next text was sent because I don't want to be inaccurate here. 
4 
5 Q No, that's quite all right. Yeah, it looks like --
A Yeah. Maybe the phone call wasn't as long as I --it felt longer than I 
6 previously indicated. But it looks like it occurred from approximately 2 --I remember 
7 sending him those three text messages immediately when we hung up, because I 
8 remember looking at that tweet, that Twitter thread while we were still on the phone and 
9 he had told me to send it to him. So right when we hung up, I sent him the Twitter 
10 thread. So the phone call looks like it would have occurred between 2:12 p.m. and 2:37 
11 p.m. 
12 
13 Q Okay. It's about 25 minutes, if I'm doing the math correctly. Okay. 
All right. So just to go back to that other question. Do you remember talking to 
14 anybody else in the White --who had worked at the White House or in the Secret Service 
15 about the incident that you described? 
16 A I do not. And that wouldn't have been a conversation I would have had 
17 with anybody. 
18 
19 Q Okay. Do you remember hearing other people talking about it? 
A I recall some agents talking about the President lashed out in the Beast or 
20 the President lashed out in the Presidential SUV. I think they would have just said the 
21 car. The President was something like "really pissed off" or "did you hear what 
22 happened?" 
23 I'm very confident that I'd remember an agent talk to me directly about what 
24 happened in the SUV. And I don't remember anybody saying anything specific enough 
25 to tie their memory to what I was --what was relayed to me by Mr. Ornate.  35 
1 But hearing --I don't want to say chatter --but hearing --overhearing 
2 conversations, just like casual conversations that I had had with various agents after 
3 January 6th, I understood that there had been some people that at least were potentially 
4 aware of it or something similar to what I had understood, but I had never asked. 
5 And this was just the mindset that I had always tried to operate in with while at 
6 the White House. I personally --my personal workplace philosophy. But I've prided 
7 myself on being trustworthy and being somebody that people can talk to about things 
8 and people not worrying about that getting out and around. 
9 So even if Mr. --because Mr. Ornate relayed that to me, as he had relayed other 
10 things to me throughout my tenure working for Mark, unless there were other people 
11 involved in the conversation, I normally would never discuss anything with people unless I 
12 found it appropriate to raise it with Mr. Meadows for whatever reason.  36 
1 
2 [3:22 p.m.] 
3 Ms. Cheney. Cassidy, a number of witnesses have testified to the committee 
4 using the phrase "water cooler chatter," that an incident in the SUV, you know, Secret 
5 Service and others saying "water cooler chatter." I'm wondering if that's something that 
6 fits the description of what you're talking about. 
7 
8 
9 
10 Ms. Hutchinson. I'm cautious because I worry that -Â­
Ms. Cheney. You don't know what water cooler is? 
[Laughter.] 
Ms. Hutchinson. I know what water cooler is. There were not any that I'm 
11 aware of. 
12 I'm sorry. And I try to give --I feel like if I say "water cooler chatter" there's 
13 going to be somebody that will come out and criticize me and say that there was --there 
14 were no water coolers in the West Wing, so I don't know what I'm talking about. 
15 [Laughter.] 
16 Ms. Hutchinson. But, generally speaking, yes, that is what I would categorize it 
17 as. 
18 BY 
19 Q And do you remember the names of any of the agents who may have been 
20 talking about this? 
21 A The one person that I am confident that I at least over---I won't say 
22 overheard, because it would have been a conversation that I would have had with this 
23 individual, because I won't say we were friends, I won't say we were friends, but we 
24 worked fairly close together. And he was not on Mr. Meadows' detail, he was on the 
25 President's detail, and he was working the rally site on January 6th. I think he was what  1 they refer to as the whip of the shift. 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 Q 
A 
Q 
A Okay. So somebody --
And he is no longer on PPD, I know. 
Yes, that's what people referred to him as. 
8 And there are a few others that --you know, he's the one person that I'm 
9 confident in, because I also spent a decent amount chime with him at --in the tent on 
10 the --at the --I spent a decent amount of time wit in the tent on 
11 January 6th. He was back and forth and sort of moving all around. 37 
12 But whenever he'd come in the tent just for a 5-minute breather, he'd come stand 
13 with myself and who was working Mr. Meadows at the rally that day. 
14 And I spoke with-frequently, too. We had traveled a lot together, so we 
15 knew each other fairly well. 
16 Q Other thanâ , anybody else that you can think of? 
17 A I'll put more thought to it, and I have put more thought to it the last few 
18 months, too, because I so badly want to be able to identify people specifically. But just 
19 because it's such a sensitive topic, I want to be careful with that and not misremember a 
20 conversation that may or may not have occurred. 
21 But I would say in the last 15 days of the administration, but probably the 6th, 7th, 
22 8th specifically, I probably heard a reference to the President's temper 
23 post-rally/pre-White House return referenced between 8 to 12 times. 
24 Q And one thing you just said, and I want to make sure I'm not 
25 misunderstanding this, is you said you want to be careful because you don't want to  38 
1 misremember a conversation that may or may not have occurred. You're talking about 
2 between other people, not the conversation --
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Correct. 
--you had with -Â­
Correct. 
--with Mr. Ornate? 
Oh, correct, correct. 
Okay. 
I'm sorry. Thank you for making that clarification. I don't want to 
10 misremember a conversation. 
11 I would frequently go over to room 55 in the Eisenhower Building, which is where 
12 there were --the lab with the PPD agents would --it was their down room, is what they 
13 called it. 
14 So I would go over there. That's where Mr. Meadows' agents would frequently 
15 spend time when he was in the West Wing. So I frequently would go over there to see 
16 them, kind of let them know what he was going on. But then I would talk to the agents 
17 in there. And sometimes there would be up to 20, 25 agents in there at a time, 
18 depending on the President's movements that day. 
19 And there'd also be, like on West Executive Avenue there would be the CAT shifts, 
20 the Counter Assault Team, and I knew a lot of the Counter Assault Team members. So, 
21 you know, I was frequently around Secret Service agents. 
22 I don't want to misremember a conversation that I may attribute to John 
23 Smith --that is a hypothetical name --when it could have been Adam Smith, another 
24 hypothetical name. 
25 Q Okay. So just to be ultra-clear for the record, do you have any doubt about  39 
1 a conversation with Mr. Ornate on January 6th that he relayed to you? 
2 A I have no doubts in the conversation that I had with Mr. Ornate on 
3 January 6th. I have no doubts in how I've relayed that story privately and publicly. And 
4 I have no doubts about the two instances on January 19th and April 16th about the 
5 conversation --the following conversations I had in reference to that incident. 
6 Q Okay. Great. Anything else about what we're looking at here on exhibit 
7 55 related to those 19th --excuse me --January 19th or April 16th that you think would 
8 be helpful for us to know? 
9 
10 
11 
12 A 
Q Not more than what's already laid out here. 
Okay. 
Mr. Jordan. Do you want to take a 5-minute break? 
We've been going for, yeah, about an hour or so. I think now is a 
13 good time for a quick break. Okay. Then we'll go off the record. 
14 
15 [Recess.] 
- Okay. Let's go back on the record. It's 3:58, and we're resuming 
16 the transcribed interview of Ms. Cassidy Hutchinson. 
17 BY 
18 Q So, Ms. Hutchinson, you produced to the committee texts with several 
19 people before we met yesterday and I wanted to go through some of those. 
20 understand you've already gone through some of them in the portion that I was not here 
21 for yesterday. 
22 But the first is with Alex Cannon. And I believe those are exhibit 51. So it looks 
23 like these text messages start on February the 5th. 
24 
25 A 
Q That's correct. 
Had you been introduced to Alex Cannon before, or did you know him from  40 
1 your time working in the administration? 
2 A I did not. I received a phone call from Eric Herschmann the 
3 morning of --on the morning of Saturday, February 5th, and Eric let me know that Alex 
4 Cannon would be in touch with me. I had not heard Alex Cannon's name in my life prior 
5 to Eric Herschmann notifying me that I would be receiving a call from him later that day. 
6 Q Okay. And I should say, too, that some of this, I understand, you may have 
7 already gone through in the prior session. That's okay. Feel free to just say so --
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 2022. 
13 
14 
15 
16 A 
Q Okay. 
--and we can move on to something else. 
February 5th is after you were served with the subpoena. Is that right? 
A Correct. I was served with the subpoena on Wednesday, January 26th, 
Ms. Cheney. I think we did go over this. 
You went through these? Okay. 
BY 
Q It looks like a lot of the earlier discussion had to do with jobs and just the 
17 select committee subpoena. 
18 Is that what you recall as well? 
19 A Correct. Although I don't know how thoroughly we went through some of 
20 the texts, but we did talk about broadly what was touched on in the texts. I don't know 
21 if I specified each text message to what we spoke about yesterday. 
22 Q It looks like just from a date perspective it runs through February 7th and 
23 then picks up again on May 5th. 
24 A So the conversation I had with Alex Cannon on Saturday, he called me and 
25 let me know that there would be an attorney in touch --that they --I didn't understand  41 
1 who "they" was really. I mean, I had an idea, but he didn't define who "they" was. 
2 But, anyway, Alex let me know that they had an attorney for me and the attorney would 
3 be reaching out in the coming days. 
4 I asked who it was. They said --Alex let me know that I would know when the 
5 attorney reached out to me. 
6 Monday, February 7th --so my document --original document turnover date was 
7 Tuesday, February 8th. So by the early afternoon of Monday, February 7th, I had not 
8 received a call from an attorney that was being assigned to me. So I texted Alex again to 
9 let him know, like just to kind of jog his memory that I needed to have that conversation. 
10 And that explains this text message chain. And then I did not speak with him 
11 again until Thursday, May 5th, because Stefan Passantino called me later that afternoon, 
12 on Monday, February 7th. 
13 Q Okay. And then in May you pick up a conversation with Alex. Had you 
14 talked to him between then, February 7th, and May 5th --
15 A I had not. 
16 
17 
18 Q 
A 
Q --to the best can you recall? 
I had not. 
Looks like on the 5th, these text messages talk about sending a resume to 
19 various people at something called Red Curve. 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A Correct. 
I assume you spoke about Red Curve yesterday. 
We did. 
Q Okay. Then I won't retread that ground. 
And then I do want to go to page 4. 
He says, "Good luck to you."  1 
2 
3 down. You thank him for what he's done. 
He says, "Don't worry." And I'm paraphrasing here and very much boiling it 
4 And you say, "I promise the committee won't be getting, smiley cats, and Stefan 
5 for round three in a few weeks." 
6 Are you referring in that text message to coming in the third time to speak with 
7 the committee on May 17th? 
8 A That's correct. I, as we discussed yesterday, I had back-channeled to the 
9 committee for that third interview. I was in a mindset where I was a bit worried that 
10 Trump world would figure out that I back-channeled to the committee for the third 
11 interview. I wanted to make sure that Trump world --I wanted to do my best to make 
12 sure Trump world had no indication that I back-channeled to the committee for a third 
13 interview. 42 
14 So that message --in that message I was playing into the, "I have no idea why I'm 
15 going in here but I'll do what Stefan tells me to do." 
16 And Stefan's instruction was --I believe there's also a text from this --"I think if 
17 you smile and don't" --"If you say less than seven words," something like that --that's 
18 probably in here somewhere --"then they won't ask you many questions." 
19 Q That conversation, it looks like, continues for a bit, at least a few messages, 
20 and then picks up again on the 18th after you met with the committee on the 17th. 
21 You ask Alex, "Do you have time for a quick call?" 
22 
23 A 
Q Correct. 
And then the next day you say, "I'm sorry to bug you," and went on in a 
24 few-message exchange. 
25 Did you talk to Alex Cannon after that third meeting with the committee on the  43 
1 17th? 
2 A I did. I spoke with Alex Cannon and Justin Clark on a three-way call on 
3 Friday, May 20th, 2022. 
4 Q Okay. 
5 A And this call --so I had my interview, my third interview, with the committee 
6 on Tuesday, May 17th. 
7 The day after my third interview with the committee, on Wednesday, May 18th, 
8 Stefan let me know that I --he spoke with Justin Clark, Alex Cannon, and Eric Herschmann 
9 and suggested that I call --that I have a call with all three of them. 
10 I reached out to initiate the call with Alex Cannon and Justin Clark per Stefan's 
11 instruction. And then that Friday, May 20th, I received a call on Signal from Eric 
12 Herschmann. 
13 
14 
15 Q 
A Did you already talk about those calls in the session yesterday? 
I believe so. 
Q Yes. Okay. 
16 Mr. Jordan. And just --I think you said initially --it may be for the 
17 record --Friday, May 22nd. And you had Friday, May 20th. 
18 Ms. Hutchinson. I'm sorry. Friday, May 20th, 2022. 
19 BY 
20 
21 Q Okay. 
A Friday, May 20th, 2022, is the date that I spoke with Alex Cannon and Justin 
22 Clark on a three-way call. Friday, May 20th, 2022, is also the day that Eric Herschmann 
23 called me on Signal that evening. 
24 Q This message is on the 18th. Do you remember talking to just Alex before 
25 then? And it doesn't suggest here that you actually talked. So I'm just trying to see if  1 you recall any other conversations you had with Alex. 
2 
3 
4 A 
Q 
A I had a call with Alex Cannon on Thursday, May 5th -Â­
Never mind the motorcycle. 
I had a call with Alex Cannon on Thursday, May 5th, 2022, that essentially 44 
5 entailed, in essence, entailed what he followed up with in the iMessage on Thursday, May 
6 5th, 2022, at 6:16 p.m. 
7 
8 
9 Q 
A 
Q Okay. The Red Curve, various folks. 
Correct. 
Got you. Okay. So in this May 19th thread here, starting on page 6 of 
10 exhibit 51, there are several messages after your testimony on the 17th. 
11 You asked to connect with him. 
12 He says he'll be in D.C. 
13 You say, "Tomorrow is perfect." And, again, I'm summarizing some of this. 
14 "And thanks for getting back to you. Sorry to bother you. Also sorry for everything 
15 else." 
16 Can you tell us what you meant when you said "sorry to bother you" and "sorry 
17 for everything else, too"? 
18 A The original "I'm sorry to bother you again" was apologizing because I had 
19 texted Alex Cannon on Wednesday, May 18th, at 2:47 p.m. he didn't respond. So I 
20 was apologizing for sending a double message 2 days in a row, sending him the text 
21 message 2 days in a row. 
22 The "also sorry for everything else, too" was referring to what I knew he was 
23 aware that I had discussed with the committee in my third interview on Tuesday, May 
24 17th, 2022. 
25 Q Do you know how he learned about that, what you discussed with the  45 
1 committee? 
2 A Mr. Passantino informed him. Mr. Passantino --I'm under the impression 
3 Mr. Passantino placed a call to Alex Cannon, Justin Clark, and Eric Herschmann the night 
4 after my third interview, as well as a call to John Moran and George Terwilliger the night 
5 after my third interview. 
6 
7 
8 
9 Q 
A 
Q I assume you discussed the details of that yesterday, as well. 
We did. 
Okay. Great. Then we can move through that. 
Mr. Hunt. Can we put on the record that with John Moran and George 
10 Terwilliger was a call from John Moran or to John Moran, as you recall? 
11 Ms. Hutchinson. I recall Stefan and I were at dinner after my third interview, and 
12 we were engaging in an active discussion about why he felt it was best to call John Moran 
13 and George Terwilliger to let them know what was discussed in my third interview with 
14 the committee. 
15 I was pushing back on that. I did not want him to call John Moran and George 
16 Terwilliger. 
17 As we're having this discussion, his phone is face up on the table and I see John 
18 Moran's name light up with an incoming call. 
19 
20 - Okay. 
Ms. Cheney. And this, just to be clear, so was this after he had talked to Alex 
21 Cannon and Justin Clark? 
22 
23 
24 Ms. Hutchinson. That would have been before. 
Ms. Cheney. Okay. 
Ms. Hutchinson. This was --we left the third interview, got in a taxi. He spoke 
25 with Maggie Haberman on the phone. Stefan spoke with Maggie Haberman on the  46 
1 phone. 
2 We arrived at Hank's Oyster Bar at The Wharf in Washington, D.C. We had 
3 ordered one round of drinks. 
4 He received the call from John Moran. He stepped out for approximately, I 
5 would say, between 20 and 30 minutes. Came back in. 
6 As I am leaving the restaurant that evening, walking to my Uber, he let me know 
7 that he thought it was best to also inform Alex Cannon, Justin Clark, and Eric Herschmann 
8 what was discussed in the third interview, to which I also pushed back on. But then I 
9 added a somewhat sarcastic remark and said, "But I know you're going to do what you 
10 want to do anyway," something to that effect. 
11 And then on Wednesday, May 18th, he let me know that he did speak with all of 
12 them and everything was --everything was all good. And he suggested that I reach out 
13 to all --to Justin Clark, Alex Cannon, Eric Herschmann. 
14 BY 
15 Q The next message in this thread, after the one we just discussed, he writes 
16 back. He says he'll be in D.C. and talks about potentially meeting up. 
17 And he says to you, "You don't need to apologize. It's not your fault people did 
18 things in front of you. It's not your fault the committee subpoenaed you and it's noble 
19 of you to tell the truth. You're a good soul." 
20 And then you reply, looks like trying to set up a meetup with Mr. Cannon. 
21 What did you understand his message to you to be, that you don't need to 
22 apologize and it's noble of you to tell the truth, you're a good soul? 
23 A After the third interview, Stefan and I did have a conversation at dinner that 
24 night. And I don't know if he shared this part of our conversation with Alex Cannon, 
25 Justin Clark, and Eric Herschmann.  47 
1 But I remember telling Stefan that, as uncomfortable as the day was, I felt good at 
2 least telling the truth and it's not --again, sort of playing into the same thing that Alex 
3 had iterated here, which was it's not my fault I was subpoenaed. All I could do was 
4 answer --answer truthfully. 
5 And had an idea of what the committee was going to ask me in that third 
6 interview, while Stefan did not. I'm under the impression Stefan did not have an idea of 
7 what the committee would ask me in that third interview. 
8 And I had relayed to Stefan. And Stefan also knew --I'm confident Stefan knew 
9 the whole time that I wanted to do the right thing. And while we had, in the beginning 
10 of our attorney-client relationship, I had relayed that to him and I had relayed to him that 
11 I believed doing the right thing was being forthcoming and trying to put together 
12 timelines, because I am a very date-oriented person, and I thought that I could be helpful, 
13 in Stefan's --I'm under the impression Stefan's perspective of doing the right thing was 
14 withholding information that he didn't deem --that withholding information from the 
15 committee that he did not deem as my responsibility to share, that other people would 
16 be more well-suited to share. 
17 And after the third interview I think he knew that I felt good about it, good 
18 enough, as good as I possibly could. And it was a different approach that I had --than 
19 what I had taken in the first two interviews with the committee. 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 Ms. Cheney. Can we just take a break for a second,-? 
- Sure. Absolutely. 
Ms. Cheney. Just 10 minutes. We'll be right back. 
- Let's go off the record. 
[Recess.] 
~ All right. Let's go back on the record. It's 4:38, and we're  48 
1 resuming the transcribed interview of Ms. Cassidy Hutchinson. 
2 BY 
3 Q So I want to pick up with some text messages that you exchanged with Liz 
4 Horning and that you provided to the committee. 
5 It appears from these text messages --and I understand you probably talked 
6 about this yesterday --but that you were having conversations with Ben Williamson from 
7 the time it was announced that you would be subpoenaed by the select committee and 
8 through at least February. Is that right? 
9 
10 A 
Q 
11 focus on. That's correct. 
Okay. So in these messages there are just a couple of those that I'd like to 
12 On page 7 of the text messages with Liz Horning, it's exhibit 53, there are several 
13 messages you exchange with him, it looks like on January the 26th --or, excuse me, with 
14 Liz Horning --on January the 26th. 
15 And one of them, at the bottom of page 7, says, "B said he talked to Ma lot before 
16 his deposition." 
17 Can you first describe who you're referring to in this message as "B" and who 
18 you're referring to as "M"? 
19 A In this message that I sent to Liz Horning, "B" is referring to Ben Williamson 
20 and "M" is referring to Mark Meadows. 
21 Q Did you have conversation --or conversations --with Mr. Williamson about 
22 what he spoke to Mr. Meadows about before Ben went in for his deposition with the 
23 committee? 
24 A Ben called me the night after --the night that he was --had an interview 
25 with the committee, so the night of Tuesday, January 25th, 2022.  49 
1 And in that phone conversation he let me know that, in essence, what I'm 
2 speaking about here, that the committee had a lot of questions about me. And, you 
3 know, at this point I had not been served my subpoena yet. So we're kind of talking 
4 through the semantics of what he was asked in the interviews. 
5 I had asked Ben what he was saying to things, like if he was responding to them, 
6 because I didn't think that Ben would really have the insight to answer a lot of these 
7 questions. 
8 And that's when Ben let me know that the committee asked if I would be better 
9 suited to answer several of the questions that he was asked himself. 
10 In that phone conversation I had asked Ben if he had --if he spoke with Mark and 
11 whether Mark knew he was deposed by the committee. 
12 And he said, "Yeah, Mark and I" --he said something to the --Ben said something 
13 to the effect of, "Yeah, Mark and I speak almost every day. I work for him. But, yes, he 
14 knows I was deposed yesterday." He knows I was deposed or interviewed yesterday. 
15 I'm not sure how he categorized his work with the committee. "He knows that I was 
16 interviewed yesterday, and he knows generally the questions that they asked me." 
17 I don't remember Ben and I elaborating more on that phone --during that phone 
18 conversation on what he precisely spoke about with Mr. Meadows. 
19 Q Let me ask you. I'll stop you there, and let me ask you specifically. And I 
20 want to break this up into the period before Ben went in for his deposition with the 
21 committee. 
22 So did --what did Ben tell you about his conversations with Mark Meadows before 
23 he went in for his deposition? 
24 A I'm under the impression that Mr. Meadows helped Ben find an attorney or 
25 helped Ben finance an attorney. And I'm under the impression from my conversations  50 
1 with Ben Williamson that the attorney Ben used that Mark had connections to was 
2 potentially through the arm of CPI where Mark works, that Cleta Mitchell runs. I'm not 
3 exactly sure how all of that works. 
4 But I'm under the impression that he worked with Mark and the Cleta side of 
5 things to be set up with an attorney at a low cost and that Mark was going to potentially 
6 be paying for his legal bills. 
7 Mark, Ben, and I had those conversations throughout the month of November 
8 after Ben and I both were in a press release to be subpoenaed by the committee. In 
9 November, I was stressed about finding an attorney and I had asked Ben if he had had 
10 any luck, et cetera. So those conversations occurred around the November-December 
11 timeframe. 
12 And as we progressed through this time period, you know, I never really asked 
13 Ben what he spoke about with Mark throughout December and January, although Ben did 
14 call me the night, on Sunday, December 12th, or --I'm sorry --Monday, December 13th, 
15 2021, and let me know that Mark was going to withdraw his cooperation with the 
16 committee the next day. 
17 As we progressed through January, I don't recall Ben detailing many of the 
18 conversations that he had with Mark ahead of his interview with the committee, other 
19 than, you know, Mark thinks it's completely acceptable, as does my attorney, to say I 
20 don't recall some answers to, especially --well, if you don't recall anything, then Ben said 
21 something to the effect of to me that the committee doesn't know what you can and 
22 can't recall, this is such a witch hunt, this is BS, like things to that effect. 
23 Ms. Cheney. Did Ben tell you that he had talked to Mark before Ben came in to 
24 talk to the committee about his interview with the committee? 
25 Ms. Hutchinson. He did.  1 
2 Ms. Cheney. And did he give you any specifics about that? 
Ms. Hutchinson. I want to be more clear that he told me that he spoke with 51 
3 Mark prior to his interview with the committee, but I don't recall Ben telling me if he told 
4 Mark his interview date. I just knew that they were speaking in the weeks leading up to 
5 his interview with the committee. And that also came out in the same conversation as, 
6 "Well, Mark and I talk almost every day. I still work for him." So it's natural for them 
7 to have conversations anyway. 
8 Ms. Cheney. And did he tell you if they were having conversations about his 
9 interview with the committee? 
10 Ms. Hutchinson. After he had his interview with the committee, I had asked him 
11 on two occasions, on the 26th --on January 26th, 2022, and February 1st, 2022, if he had 
12 let Mark know about his committee interview, how it went, and anything that was 
13 discussed. 
14 BY 
15 Q Did Ben ever tell you that Mr. Meadows tried to instruct Ben or suggest to 
16 Ben that he stay away from any topics, any particular testimony he should not provide to 
17 the committee? 
18 A Ben did not specify any particular topics that Mr. Meadows may have 
19 suggested to stay away from with responses to the committee. 
20 Ben generally said to me, though, that Mr. Meadows, along with Ben's attorney, 
21 said that something to the effect of "I don't recall" is a completely acceptable answer to 
22 give the committee on questions, the committee doesn't know what you can and can't 
23 recall. 
24 Q Did you ever have any further questions --or, excuse me, 
25 conversations --with Ben about --and that we haven't gone over and you haven't gone  1 over yesterday --about any instructions that Mark Meadows gave to him or to anybody 
2 else about their appearance before the select committee? 
3 
4 A 
Q Can you repeat the first part of that question? 
Yes. Did you have any other conversations with Ben where he relayed to 52 
5 you that Mark instructed him on how to answer questions or provide information to the 
6 select committee or if Mark did that with anybody else? 
7 And, again, we don't want to go over anything else --anything you've already gone 
8 over. We don't need to do that. 
9 A I am also cautious about the word "instruct" because, one, it's a strong 
10 indicator that it was a direction. And, you know, I can't attest to whether Mark gave Ben 
11 specific directions or not. 
12 I also didn't have personal conversations --I did not have any conversations with 
13 Mr. Meadows after January 20th, 2021. So I just --I want to be cautious with that word. 
14 Aside from my phone conversation with Ben the night before my second 
15 deposition, which at that time Ben --I'm under the impression that both Ben and Mark 
16 were under the impression that that was my first interview with the committee. And 
17 that was the call that had lines of loyalty in it. 
18 
19 
20 
21 Q 
A 
Q 
A The call that you already described for us. 
The call that I've already described to the committee. 
Okay. 
I do remember Ben and I exchanging text messages at either the end of 
22 February or during the first week of March. And I can pinpoint the date because I 
23 remember I was driving to New Jersey. And I was driving --but could we break for a 
24 moment, please? 
25 Mr. - Sure. Certainly. Yeah, let's go off the record.  53 
1 [Discussion off the record.] 
2 Mr. - Where we left off, you took a brief break just to refresh yourself, it 
3 looks like, or to look for something. 
4 But the question pending was whether you knew of any instructions relayed to 
5 you through Ben or suggestions by Mark Meadows to Ben or other witnesses who 
6 appeared before the select committee about their testimony.

10 
11 Ms. Hutchinson. Instructions? 
Ms. Cheney. Discussions. 
Ms. Hutchinson. Discussions? 
~ Discussions, suggestions. 
Ms. Hutchinson. There's one conversation that I do remember having with Ben. 
12 I don't have the conversation because it's on Signal and there's a 1-day expiration set. 
13 But I do recall it was on --this conversation occurred on Thursday, March 3rd, 
14 2022. Ben and I were texting on Signal about I don't know --I don't even --I don't 
15 remember --I don't think it was about my --I think Ben --oh, you know what it was? 
16 On --let me start over. 
17 On Thursday, March 3rd, 2022, Ben had texted me while I was driving to New 
18 Jersey and asked me if I had a date set for my interview yet with the committee and if I 
19 had found an attorney yet. 
20 And I believe that I had kind of skirted around both responses. I think I had said, 
21 like, we're engaging with the committee and, yes, I do have an attorney. 
22 And I remember Ben had sent me his attorney's contact information and said, "In 
23 case your attorney wants to reach out to mine, here's my attorney's contact information," 
24 something to the effect of I know that he'd be willing to connect if he wants to go over 
25 what the committee asked me in my interviews.  54 
1 And I remember thanking Ben for sending his contact information. And I do 
2 remember saying to Ben, like, "I'm sort of nervous for my first interview whenever it 
3 occurs." 
4 And then Ben had said --I recall Ben saying something to the effect of, "Well, just 
5 remember, in my conversations with Mark beforehand he let me know that there's 
6 nothing to worry about. And when in doubt just say, 'I don't recall."'

8 Q BY 
There is in your messages on February the 8th, which is page --with Liz 
9 Horning --page 35, it looks like there was a conversation or message you exchange with 
10 Ms. Horning. 
11 
12 
13 
14 It says, "Ben just called. We haven't talked in a week," at the bottom. 
And then on page 36 of the exhibit it goes on. It continues into February the 8th. 
A 
Q That just sparked something in my head. 
He said, "Oh, by the way, how are things going finding an attorney?" 
15 And you go on and say, "I've been talking to a lot of people, and someone reached 
16 out to the committee on my behalf yesterday." 
17 Ms. Horning says, "I think that was a wise approach." 
18 And then you discuss kind of your responses to Ben. 
19 Is this the conversation you're talking about or something different? 
20 
21 
22 A 
Q 
A This is something different. 
Okay. 
This conversation I specifically remember was Thursday, March 3rd, the 
23 conversation I previously referenced --
24 
25 Q 
A Yes. 
--in my prior response, I recall occurring on Thursday, March 3rd, 2022,  55 
1 because, one, because I was driving to New Jersey and I remember that part. But it also 
2 was before my second interview, and I knew that Stefan had let George Terwilliger and 
3 John Moran know that I had an interview scheduled with the committee on Monday, 
4 March 7th, 2022. 
5 So I remember thinking when I received that text from Ben on Thursday, March 
6 3rd, Mark must have had a conversation with Ben and that's why Ben's reaching out to 
7 me about my committee interview. 
8 
9 
10 
11 Q 
A 
Q 
A Okay. 
Because Mark and I were not speaking. 
Okay. 
At times I sort of felt like, because there were times where Ben would reach 
12 out to me where I would sort of feel like it was out of the blue or there was no previous 
13 context to his outreach. 
14 And, again, this is where I sometimes would tell myself I was overthinking. But 
15 also, like, knowing Mark well, Ben has always been a conduit for Mr. Meadows. And 
16 whenever Ben would reach out sort of abruptly and more out of the blue about 
17 committee activity, whether it pertained to Mark, Ben, or myself, I always understood 
18 that as Mark using Ben as a conduit to get information from me so he wasn't in the dark 
19 about anything. 
20 
21 
22 - Okay. 
Any follow-up there? 
Ms. Cheney. No. We went through a lot of the, yesterday, the understanding 
23 about the first and second interview. 
24 - Very good then. 
25 At this point I don't know,â  if you have anything.  1 
2 -No. 
- At this point I think we're reaching the end here. And if there's 56 
3 anything else that, you know, you'd like to provide us that we haven't gone over, for the 
4 testimony today or anything else, frankly, then we would certainly welcome that. 
5 And if there is something that you recall after this, certainly reach out to your 
6 attorneys. And we can be in touch with them, too. 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 But do want to give you the opportunity if there's something else that you want. 
Ms. Hutchinson. [Inaudible.] 
Voice. I don't think so either. 
Mr. Jordan. Huh-uh. 
- Okay. Very good. Then I think we can go off the record. 
[Whereupon, at 4:56 p.m., the interview was concluded.]  1
