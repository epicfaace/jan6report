3 It is 3:56 and we are beginning the deposition of Mayra Rodriguez 
4 with the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States 
5 Capitol. 
6 So this is a deposition of Mayra Rodriguez conducted by the committee pursuant 
7 to House Resolution 503. 
8 At this time, I'd ask you, Ms. Rodriguez, to introduce yourself and spell your last 
9 name for the record. 
10 
11 
12 
13 The Witness. Sure. Mayra Rodriguez. My last name is R-o-d-r-i-g-u-e-z. 
Fantastic. Thank you, Ms. Rodriguez. 
And, counsel, can you please introduce yourself? 
Mr. Blake. Sure. My name is Wright Blake, W-r-i-g-h-t, last name is Blake, 
14 B-1-a-k-e, and I'm the attorney for Ms. Rodriguez. 
15 My name is I am a senior investigative counsel to 
16 the select committee. I will be leading the deposition, but others may jump in with 
17 questions as well. 
And in the room with me are he's staff for the select committee, 18 
19 along with investigative counsel for the select committee. Also joining us 
20 on the Webex are several members of the select committee staff, including 
21 who's chief investigative counsel. 
22 So before we begin, I do just want to go over a few of the ground rules for 
23 depositions with the House. 3 
24 You are appearing pursuant to subpoena, and there is an official reporter who will 
25 be transcribing the entire interview. As you probably heard, this is also being recorded  4 
1 on the Webex platform, but the official record of this deposition is the one that's being 
2 taken by the reporter. 
3 There are two of them there. There's only one who's taking the record at a time, 
4 generally, and they may trade off. But there is going to be one continuous record which 
5 you will be able to review, if you choose to, after the deposition is complete. 
6 Because the official record, though, is the reporter, they can't take things down 
7 like nonverbal responses or shaking your head. So we just ask that you answer the 
8 questions in words and not gestures. 
9 And also for ease of the reporter, if you let me finish my question before you 
10 answer, then I'll also let you finish answering before my next question, and that should 
11 make it a fairly easy process. 
12 We do ask that you provide complete answers based on your best recollection. 
13 If you don't recall something, that's fine, you can say so. And if I ask a question that's 
14 not clear to you, please feel free to ask for clarification and I will do so. 
15 If you do refuse to answer a question, you can only do so based on privileges 
16 recognized by the select committee. And if you do have an objection, then the staff, we 
17 can either proceed with the deposition or seek a ruling of the chairman on the objection. 
18 And if the chairman overrules any objection, you would be required to answer the 
19 question. 
20 Do you understand everything we've gone over so far? 
21 
22 
23 The Witness. Yes. 
Great. Thank you. 
I do also want to remind mind you that it is unlawful to deliberately provide false 
24 information to Congress. And since this deposition is under oath, doing so could expose 
25 you to criminal penalties, including lying to Congress, under 18 U.S.C. 1001 for criminal  1 charges for perjury. 
2 Do you understand that? 
3 
4 The Witness. Yes. 
Very good. Then at this time I would ask that you stand and raise 
5 your right hand to be sworn in. 
6 The Reporter. Do you solemnly declare and affirm under the penalty of perjury 
7 that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing 
8 but the truth? 
9 The Witness. I affirm. 
10 Thank you. 
11 And before we jump into the questions, just logistically, if you ever need a break 
12 or you want to stop and speak with your attorney, please let us know and we can 
13 certainly do that. I think we've found in this process that it's usually easiest if you want 
14 to speak with your attorney to both turn off your camera and go on mute, and that way 
15 we won't hear anything you guys discuss. 
16 EXAMINATION 
17 BY 
18 Q So the first thing to go over is you received a subpoena from the select 
19 committee to produce documents and appear today. Is that right? 
20 
21 A 
Q Yes. 
All right. And you are the Mayra Rodriguez who's listed in the subpoena 
22 that you received. It's also shown up on the screen, if you're able to see that. Is that 
23 right? 
24 
25 A 
Q Yes. 
Okay. We did receive and I'm going to show exhibit 2, a letter from you 5  6 
1 dated February the 10th, from you. And it says, "I do not have any documents to 
2 produce," followed by a signature. 
3 Is that the document that you provided to the select committee in response to the 
4 request for documents? 
5 
6 A 
Q Yes. 
Okay. So did you search for documents? Did you look in your email, for 
7 example, for any documents that are responsive to the select committee's subpoena? 
8 
9 A 
Q Yes. I looked through my emails. I couldn't find anything. 
Okay. And did you look through text messages that you may have had to 
10 look for documents responsive to the subpoena? 
11 
12 A 
Q I would not have received a text. So I did not look through my texts. 
Okay. Not even a text about, like, planning or organizing or showing up at 
13 a certain date or time? 
14 
15 A 
Q I don't believe that I received a text. 
Okay. What about saved documents, hard copy documents, if you had any, 
16 did you look for those? 
17 A Yeah. I received nothing. 
18 Q All right. And as we go through this, I'll ask you certain planning or 
19 organizing that happened. And if you do think of anything, like you have an email or a 
20 text message that you can recall as we're going through this, I would just ask that you let 
21 us know about that. And then we can work with Mr. Blake to get any responsive 
22 documents that you end up having. 
23 And I would ask, to the extent that you haven't already looked through your text 
24 messages for any responsive documents, that you do so there as well. 
25 So, Ms. Rodriguez, where do you live?  1

6 
7 
8 A 
Q 
A I live in the city of Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan. 
How long have you been in Michigan? 
Golly. Let's see. I would say 30 years-plus. 
Q Okay. What do you do for a living? 
A I'm a lawyer. 
Q What type of law do you practice? 
A I practice probate and child welfare. 
Q Okay. Now, you were a Republican elector --or a proposed Republican 
9 elector --for the 2020 Presidential election. Is that right? 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 right? A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Yes. 
Had you done that before in previous elections? 
Never. 
How did you become a proposed elector for the 2020 Presidential election? 
At a 14th District meeting, I was selected by the members that were there. 
District meeting of whom, which group? 
The 14th --Michigan 14th District. 
The Republican Party? 
Yes. 
So is it fair to say you're active in party politics in Michigan? 
I was. 
Okay. Now, at the time, the Michigan GOP chair was Laura Cox. Is that 
Yes. 
Do you know her? 
She was the chair of the party, so for 2 years I knew her. 7  1 Q Did you have personal interactions with her or was it really just a kind of a 
2 business relationship so to speak? 
3 
4 A 
Q It was just going to Republican events and I would see her there. 
And we may get into some additional questions about her, but there are a 
5 few others that I'll ask you about, including other people who acted as electors for the 
6 2020 Presidential election. 
7 Do you know Kathy Berden? 
8 
9 
10 
11 A 
Q 
A 
Q Yes, I do. 
Who is that? 
She is our RNC person from Michigan. 
And did you communicate with her about meeting as alternate electors for 
12 the 2020 election? 
13 
14 
15 A 
Q 
A No. 
You never did? 
When we went to the meeting, we --that's when I talked --well, not her in 
16 particular, just the group. 
17 Q Okay. And we'll get into the specifics about how the meeting came to be 
18 and who organized it. 
19 But what about Meshawn Maddock, do you know her? 
20 
21 A 
Q Yes, I do. 
And did you interact with her during --or, excuse me, before you met to 
22 vote as alternate electors in the 2020 election? 
23 
24 A 
Q No, I did not. 
So the Michigan election --or the Presidential election in Michigan --was 8 
25 called on Wednesday, November the 4th, after the election, so the day after the election.  1 
2 Do you recall that? 
A Generally, yes. 9 
3 Q Okay. And President Biden was declared the winner, and he won by 
4 approximately 155,000 votes. 
5 Are you familiar with that? 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 A 
Q I am. 
Okay. If you could pull up exhibit No. 3, please. 
Are you able to see exhibit No. 3 that's shown there on the screen? 
A 
Q Yes. 
Okay. And this is an amended certificate of ascertainment of the electors 
11 of the President and Vice President of the United States of America. And this is from the 
12 Governor of Michigan, Governor Whitmer, where she essentially certifies that the people 
13 listed there would be electors for the electoral college from the State of Michigan. 
14 Are you familiar with this document? 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 Mr. Blake. Repeat your message. You have to repeat your message. 
The Witness. No. 
Q 
A 
Q BY 
No? Do you recall ever receiving this document from anybody? 
No. 
Do you recall ever receiving a document like this with your name on it 
21 designating you as an elector from the State of Michigan? 
22 
23 A 
Q At this time, I'd like to invoke my Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. 
Okay. And is that because you think your answers might tend to 
24 incriminate you in a proceeding, a later criminal proceeding? 
25 A I just take the Fifth. Thank you.  10 
1 Q Okay. When did you first hear talk about casting electoral votes for Donald 
2 Trump, even if he did not win the State of Michigan? 
3 
4 A 
Q I take my Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. 
Okay. From whom did you first hear that the Republican electors would 
5 meet to vote for then President Trump, despite the fact that he lost the State of 
6 Michigan? 
7 
8 A 
Q I invoke my Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. 
Are you aware of any efforts to start planning for Republican electors to 
9 meet in the State of Michigan even if President Trump lost and --let me rephrase that. 
10 Were you aware before the election on November 3rd that Republican electors 
11 would meet to vote for President Trump even if he lost the State of Michigan? 
12 
13 A 
Q I take my Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, please. 
Did you ever communicate with Laura Cox about the Republican electors 
14 meeting to cast electoral college votes for President Trump even though he lost the State 
15 of Michigan? 
16 
17 A 
Q I take the Fifth Amendment to remain silent. 
Did you ever communicate with anybody in the Trump campaign about 
18 Republican electors meeting to vote and cast electoral college votes for President Trump, 
19 despite him losing the popular vote in Michigan? 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q No. No. 
You did not communicate with anybody in the Trump campaign? 
No, never. 
Okay. Do you know who Boris Epshteyn is? 
Who? Which? I'm sorry, the name? Give me the name, please. 
Sure. Boris Epshteyn?  1

7 
8 
9 No, I don't know that person. 
Do you know the name Mike Roman? 
Don't know that person. 
Do you know the name Mike Brown? 
Don't know that person. 
How about Jesse Law? 
Don't know that person. 
Jesse Binnall? And that is B-i-n-n-a-1-1. 
Don't know that person. 
Shawn Flynn? 
I don't know that person. 11 
10 
11 
12 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q I believe Mr. Flynn, I'd represent to you, that he may have been there when 
13 you met and cast votes as Republican electors for President Trump, as a lawyer for the 
14 campaign and election day operations coordinator. 
15 Does that change your mind about whether you know Mr. Flynn? 
16 A I wasn't introduced to Mr. Flynn. He could have been there, but I was not 
17 introduced to him. 
18 Q Okay. How about Christina Bobb, former news reporter, also working 
19 alongside the campaign? 
20 
21 A 
Q No, don't know that name. 
Okay. Did you ever talk to or see Mr. Rudy Giuliani in any dealings in 
22 Michigan related to electoral college votes? 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A Never. 
Do you know the name Jenna Ellis? 
No, does not ring a bell.  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 Q How about Matt Morgan. Do you know him? 
Do you know Justin Clark? 
A 
Q 
A 
Q No. 
Do you know somebody named Kenneth Chesebro, C-h-e-s-e-b-r-o? 
No. 
Okay. I'd represent to you that Mr. Chesebro wrote several memoranda 12 
7 about electoral college votes and alternate electors meeting to cast votes for President 
Trump. Does that ring a bell as far as Mr. Chesebro in your mind? 
A No, not at all. 
Q Do you know Judge James Troupis? 
11 A 
Q How about John Eastman, do you know him? 
13 A 
Q Okay. And you never communicated with any of the people on the list we 
15 just went through. Is that right? 
16 
17 A 
Q Right. 
Okay. When you first learned that you would be meeting to cast votes for 
18 Donald Trump --excuse me. When you --let me rephrase that. 
19 When you first learned that you'd be meeting to cast electoral college votes for 
20 then President Trump, despite the fact that he lost in Michigan, what were you told was 
21 the reason for doing so? 
22 
23 A 
Q I invoke my Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. 
Did you ever have any discussions with the alternate electors who didn't 
24 actually show up to cast electoral college votes on December 14th? And specifically I'll 
25 start with Mr. Gerald Wall.  1 
2 
3 A 
Q 
A No. 
Do you know who that is? 
You're saying he was an elector. That's what you're telling me, he was an 
4 elector, so --I don't know who that is. 13 
5 Q Okay. Do you remember at the meeting on December 14th, before casting 
6 votes, electoral college votes for then President Trump, do you remember having to 
7 replace electors who didn't show up? 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Yes. 
Okay. 
There were some people who did not show up. Yes. 
Do you remember Gerald Wall being one of them? 
I don't know. I don't --there were --I think there were, like, two or three 
13 that didn't show up. So he could have been one. I don't know him personally, though, 
14 so --
15 
16 
17 Q 
A 
Q Did you ever learn why those people didn't show up? 
No. 
Never provided a reason as to why they didn't come on December 14th to 
18 cast electoral college votes? 
19 
20 A 
Q I have no idea. 
What was the reason in your mind for casting an electoral college vote for 
21 then President Trump on December 14th, despite the fact that he had lost the State of 
22 Michigan? 
23 
24 A 
Q I assert my Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. Thank you. 
Did you talk to any alternate electors from other States? And I'd represent 
25 to you that Pennsylvania, Georgia, Wisconsin, New Mexico, Nevada, and Arizona all had  1 separate slates of electors that cast votes for then President Trump. 
2 
3 A 
Q No, I didn't speak with anyone from out of State. 
Did you ever have a conference call with lawyers about casting votes, 
4 electoral college votes, for President Trump? 
5 
6 A 
Q No. 
When you showed up to the meeting on December 14th, did you have any 
7 paperwork that you brought with you, namely electoral college vote certificates or 
8 affidavits? 
9 
10 A 
Q I assert my right to invoke my Fifth Amendment right. Thank you. 
Who organized the actual meeting place and time for the meeting of these 
11 alternate electors on December the 14th? 
I don't know. 
Was it you? It wasn't you, I take it. 
No, it wasn't me. 
Do you know if it was Ms. Berden, Kathy Berden? 
I don't know. I don't know who did that. 14 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q I understand that alternate electors were not allowed to bring their phones 
18 into the meeting on December 14th. Do you remember that? 
19 
20 
21 
22 A 
Q 
A 
Q I do remember that. That's correct. 
Do you know why? 
No. 
What happened? Was there somebody who was taking phones before you 
23 went into the building where you met as alternate electors? 
24 A I left mine in my car. So I don't know if there was someone taking the 
25 phones if you didn't leave it in your car.  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Okay. But you were told to not to bring it in beforehand? 
Yes, I was. 
Do you remember who told you that? 
It would have been a MIGOP staff member. 
Do you remember which one? 
I want to say Tony Zammit. That's someone that I know. I don't know 
7 them that well. So I remember him being there. 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Were you ever told why that was necessary to not bring phones in? 
No. 
And where did you meet as alternate electors on December the 14th? 
I invoke the Fifth Amendment, my Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. 
Do you remember if this person, Mr. Zammit, did he come with paperwork 
13 that ultimately the alternate electors filled out and signed? 
14 
15 A 
Q I invoke my Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. 
Did you meet at the capitol building to cast electoral college votes for then 
16 President Trump on December 14th? 
17 A I invoke my Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. 15 
18 Q Just to back up to one thing you mentioned. I believe you said you met at 
19 GOP headquarters. Is that on Seymour Street in Lansing, to the best of your knowledge? 
20 
21 sure. 
22 
23 A 
Q 
A It is Lansing. Now, the street, I think it's Seymour. It was in Lansing for 
Okay. Close to the capitol, though? 
I'm in a very different area from Lansing. The capitol is in Lansing, so I 
24 don't know the proximity. 
25 Q Okay. Were there restrictions on the people who were allowed into the  16 
1 GOP headquarters to cast votes in the --on December 14th? 
I don't know what you mean by restrictions. 
Like, was the public allowed to be there with you? 2 
3 
4 A 
Q 
A I don't know. I went in there as elector, you know. I don't know who was 
5 allowed [inaudible]. 
6 Q Do you remember --and you were cut off at the end there --but do you 
7 remember anybody other than electors who were there meeting on December 14th at 
8 the GOP headquarters? 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 A Yes, there were other people there. 
Q Who else was there? 
A Don't know them by name, but Trump people were there. 
Q And why do you say Trump people? 
A Because I was told that there's Trump people here, so --
Q And when you say Trump people, do you mean campaign people? 
A No. When I say Trump people, people who --actually, that's probably a fair 
16 assessment. People associated with President Trump. 
17 Q Do you remember who any of them were? 
18 A Probably some of the names that you read off. But I was never introduced 
19 to any of them. 
20 
21 
22 
23 Q 
A 
Q How many of those people associated with the Trump campaign were there? 
Hard to say. More than 1, less than 20. 
Fair enough. 
I understand that Meshawn Maddock showed up with her husband Matt 
24 Maddock, as well as lawyers from the Amistad Project and a camera crew. Do you 
25 remember that?  17 
1 A I remember --Meshawn Maddock was there. Her husband I don't believe 
2 was there, but I could be wrong. And the Amistad Project, I don't even know what that 
3 is. Sorry. 
4 Q Okay. That's fine. 
5 Do you remember a camera crew being there? 
6 A I remember when I walked into the MIGOP headquarters there was --there 
7 were cameras there. But I don't know --
8 Q Were they allowed inside to witness and record the meeting of electors on 
9 December 14th? 
10 A No, they were outside of the building. I don't know if they ever came in. 
11 That I don't know. 
12 Q Do you know if they were restricted from coming in in any way or you just 
13 don't know either way? 
14 A I just saw them when I came into the building, they were outside the 
15 building. 
16 Q Were you interviewed at any point related to your role as an alternate 
17 elector on December 14th? 
18 
19 
20 
21 A 
Q 
A 
Q I was not. 
Did those camera crews that were there, did they ask you for an interview? 
They could have. I don't --I did not interview. 
Now, a gentleman named Ian Northan was there and accompanied a group 
22 to the capitol after the vote of the alternate electors on December 14th. 
23 Do you remember Ian Northan being there? 
24 
25 A 
Q I don't know who that is. 
All right. And we'll show you a video in just a little. He's featured on the  18 
1 video and maybe you'll recognize him that way. 
2 Not yet. 
3 I understand that somebody who was associated with the Trump campaign, the 
4 individual I identified before, Shawn Flynn, was there and spoke to the group about an 
5 example of alternate electors meeting and casting votes from 1960 in Hawaii. 
6 Do you remember somebody from the Trump campaign talking about the Hawaii 
7 election of 1960 on December 14th? 
8 A I only remember Meshawn Maddock talking about that this had been done 
9 in another State. That's all. So if someone else talked about it, I don't remember. 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Do you remember what she said specifically? 
I can't be specific. Just that alternate electors were done in another State. 
Do you remember that State being Hawaii? 
No. I really don't remember which State she mentioned. 
I understand that the electors convened in the basement of the GOP 
15 headquarters building. Do you remember that? 
16 
17 A 
Q Yeah, it was the lowest floor. 
Was there any reason in particular that the basement was selected for this, 
18 that you're aware of? 
19 
20 A 
Q I have no idea. 
I also understand that people were brought up a couple at a time to sign an 
21 affidavit, essentially attesting to who you are. Do you remember doing that? 
22 A I invoke my Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. Thank you. 
23 
24 Q Bring up exhibit No. 6, please. 
On the screen is exhibit No. 6, and page one is titled "Memorandum." It's 
25 written to the President of Senate, the Archivist of the United States, the secretary of  19 
1 state for the State of Michigan, as well as the Chief Judge for the United States District 
2 Court in the Western District of Michigan. And then at the bottom there it says from 
3 Kathy Berden, chairperson, electoral college of Michigan. 
4 If you can keep scrolling, please. 
5 It's dated December 14th, 2020. And it says, "RE: Michigan's Electoral Votes 
6 for President and Vice President." 
7 And then I'll read it. It says: "Pursuant to 3 U.S.C. section 11, enclosed please 
8 find duplicate originals of Michigan's electoral votes for President and Vice President, as 
9 follows: two" --and then the number 2 --"duplicate originals for the President of the 
10 Senate and the Archivist, and one" --numeral 1--"duplicate original for the Secretary of 
11 State and Chief Judge." 
12 And if you can go to the next page. 
13 Do you recognize this document, Ms. Rodriguez? 
14 
15 A No, I do not. 
Q Okay. The next page, page 2, is titled "Certificate of the Votes of the 2020 
16 Electors from Michigan." I won't read the whole thing, but I will read the first paragraph 
17 there. 
18 It says: "We, the undersigned, being the duly elected and qualified Electors for 
19 President and Vice President of the United States of America from the State of Michigan, 
20 do hereby certify the following." And then it lists a number of things it's certifying, 
21 followed by votes at the bottom for President, casting 16 votes for Donald J. Trump and 
22 also 16 votes for Vice President Michael R. Pence. 
23 And if you can go to the next page, please. 
24 Do you recognize that document that we just looked at, page 2? 
25 A I invoke my Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.  20 
1 Q On page 3 it has a series of signatures that says, in sum and substance, that 
2 on this 14th day of December the following people signed these documents. And the 
3 second down from the left is Mayra Rodriguez, Secretary. 
4 Is that you? 
5 A I take the Fifth Amendment to remain --invoke my Fifth Amendment right to 
6 remain silent. 
7 
8 
9 silent. 
10 
11 Q And do you recognize this signature page? 
A I take the Fifth Amendment --I invoke my Fifth Amendment right to remain 
Q Thank you. You can take that down. 
I understand that Ms. Maddock took pictures --or at least one picture, I should 
12 say --from the meeting of the alternate electors on December the 14th. Do you recall 
13 that picture? 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 A Yes, I recall having a group picture taken. Yes. 
Q Do you have a copy of that picture? 
A No. 
Q Why did you take a group picture? 
A Well, we were just told to let's take a picture, so we took a picture. 
Q Who told you that? 
A I don't remember who said it. 
Q Did that occur before the electors met and filled out paperwork or after? 
A I invoke my Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. 
Q Did you ever get a copy of the paperwork that you filled out and signed as an 
24 alternate elector for Michigan? 
25 A No.  21 
1 Q So after the electors met at the GOP headquarters in Michigan, I understand 
2 that there was a walk or a march to the capitol in Lansing. Do you recall that? 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 A Yes, there was a march. 
Q Were you --did you go in that march to the capitol in Lansing? 
A No. 
Q Why didn't you go with them? 
A I didn't see a need to go. 
Q Okay. Did you ever talk to anybody who did go and ask them about their 
9 experience? 
10 
11 
12 
13 A No. I don't recall talking to anybody afterwards. 
Q All right. 
If you can play exhibit No. 9, please. 
This is a video of what happened at the capitol on December 14th. To be clear, 
14 the State capitol in Lansing. 
15 [Video shown.] 
16 B~ 
17 Q All right. We just paused exhibit No. 9, which is a video, at 1 minute and 54 
18 seconds. You can see the back of two people's heads there. The first is the woman on 
19 the right with short brown hair and it looks like a blue scarf or bandana with white stars 
20 on it. 
21 Do you recognize who that is? 
22 
23 A No. 
Q Okay. And that gentleman who is --we're looking at the back of his hair as 
24 well. It's kind of gray hair. He's wearing a blue mask and a tan overcoat it appears. 
25 Do you recognize him?  1 
2 A 
Q No. 
Do you remember either of those people being at the Michigan GOP 
3 headquarters on December 14th while you were there? 22 
4 A You know, they could have been there. I don't know what their names are. 
5 I don't know these people. 
6 Q Okay. That's fine. Thank you. 
7 If you can pull up exhibit No. 7. 
8 And while we're doing that, at the point of December 14th, did you know that the 
9 State of Michigan had certified now President Joseph Biden as the winner of the popular 
10 vote in Michigan? 
11 
12 A 
Q I assert my Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. Thank you. 
At various points throughout the post-election period --and to be clear, that 
13 would be after November the 3rd --there was reference to State legislatures meeting and 
14 reviewing evidence of fraud in order to pick or ratify a separate set of electors. 
15 Do you remember that, those discussions coming up in the State of Michigan after 
16 November 3rd, 2020? 
17 A There were a lot of discussions regarding the election. So I can't say in 
18 particular which ones I remember over others, but it's been a long battle here. 
19 Q Sure. Okay. And do you remember that coming up, and specifically for 
20 the State legislature to meet and essentially choose the Republican slate of electors for 
21 the State as opposed to the Biden set of electors? 
22 
23 
24 A 
Q 
A I wasn't involved with any of that discussion, so I really can't say. 
Okay. You don't have any personal knowledge of any of that? 
Yeah. I mean, I may have read something in the paper, but no personal 
25 knowledge of that.  23 
1 Q Did you contact any State legislators, either in the Michigan House or 
2 Michigan Senate, about having them choose a slate of electors? 
3 A I don't recall. Now, I was chair of the 14th District and there may have 
4 been something out of our district. But I don't recall. 
5 Q Okay. Is there something that's giving you that memory that maybe 
6 something happened? Are you thinking of anything in particular? 
7 A Well, I know that the group was very active with the election and the 
8 election results. So we were putting out a lot of resolutions, but I don't know if there 
9 was one in particular with this. 
10 Q All right. Now, this, exhibit 7, that you're looking at, it is a statement from 
11 Senate Majority, Mike Shirkey. And he issued a statement on --either on or just before 
12 the date that the electoral college met, December 14th, and said essentially that then 
13 President Biden was the winner and there's nothing that really anybody could do about 
14 that in the State of Michigan. 
15 I'm summarizing here. And if you'd like to read it, I'd be happy to pause and let 
16 you do so. 
17 Were you aware that Senator Shirkey came out and said that the legislature 
18 effectively wasn't going to do anything to change the results of the election in Michigan? 
19 A It may have --nothing was ever sent to me personally, but there was a lot of 
20 news articles around this time. So he may have said that. I don't know. 
21 Q Okay. And at that time do you remember Senator Shirkey indicating that 
22 now President Biden had won and there's no reason to change it? 
23 A Again, I don't have any communication with this person. So whatever I 
24 read in the newspapers. I don't know what was out there at the time. So I don't have 
25 any --I just don't recall that.  24 
1 Q Okay. After the alternate electors --and when I say that, I'm again 
2 referring to the Republican electors who met and cast votes for Donald Trump on 
3 December 14th --after they met, did you ever talk to anybody who was involved in that, 
4 any of the other people who met and cast votes that day? 
5 
6 A 
Q I assert my Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. 
Okay. And to be clear, the question was did you --or was meant to be, I 
7 should say, that may not have been all that clear, but meant to be --did you ever talk to 
8 anybody about what you did as an elector on December 14th, the meeting, the casting of 
9 the votes? 
10 
11 A 
Q I assert my Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. Thank you. 
I'm going to go over several provisions of law. I don't know if as a lawyer 
12 you're familiar with these. But Michigan Code 168.42 says that the electors from the 
13 State of Michigan are those --who end up voting for President --are those in the party 
14 that receive the most Presidential votes. 
15 And then 168.47 says that electors shall convene in the senate chamber at the 
16 capitol of the State at 2 p.m., eastern standard time, on the first Monday after the second 
17 Wednesday in December following the election. 
18 And 1678.46 says a person's not an elector essentially until the Governor sends a 
19 certificate to that person in triplicate bearing the seal of the State, notifying him or her of 
20 status as an elector. 
21 So those three legal provisions, did any of those concern you before you met with 
22 others at GOP headquarters on December 14th? 
23 
24 A 
Q I assert my Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. 
Okay. If we could pull up exhibit No. 6 again, page 2 specifically. Go 
25 down to page 2.  25 
1 So subsection A there on page 2 of exhibit No. 6 says that the electors certify that 
2 "we convened and organized in the State Capitol, in the City of Lansing, and at 2:00 p.m. 
3 Eastern Standard Time on the 14th day of December, 2020, performed the duties 
4 enjoined upon us." 
5 Did any of the electors, including yourself, who met on December 14th at the GOP 
6 headquarters have concerns about signing a statement making such a certification? 
7 
8 A 
Q I assert my Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. 
If you can go down, please. 
9 Bear with me just a moment, Ms. Rodriguez. 
10 If you go to the top of the page, page 2, correct, top of the page, it says, "We, the 
11 undersigned, being the duly elected and qualified Electors for President and Vice 
12 President of the United States from the State of Michigan." 
13 Did anybody, including yourself, who met in the GOP headquarters on December 
14 14th express concerns about certifying that you or anybody else were the duly elected 
15 and qualified electors from Michigan? 
16 
17 A 
Q At this point, I assert my Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. 
Okay. My understanding is that one of the reasons that alternate electors 
18 met and cast votes in various States for President Trump, despite the fact that he had lost 
19 those States, was because there was a possibility that any of the court cases would be 
20 successful and there would be a need to have alternate electors essentially in place. 
21 Are you aware of that justification for having alternate electors meet and cast 
22 electoral college votes? 
23 A I don't know anything about those other States, and for the rest of it I take 
24 the Fifth. 
25 Q And so with respect to Michigan you're taking the Fifth is what you're  1 saying? 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 26 
A You mentioned other States. I don't know anything about other States. 
Mr. Blake. But with Michigan, you're taking the Fifth. 
The Witness. Yes. With Michigan, I am asserting the Fifth. 
BY 
Q Okay. And are you aware that by December 14th in Michigan there had 
7 been, I believe, at least six cases that had rejected challenges to the election by the time 
8 of the electoral college meeting on December 14th, those being at least Constantino v. 
9 City of Detroit, Trump v. Benson, Trump v. Benson in Federal court, Johnson v. Benson, 
10 Stoddard v. Detroit, and King v. Whitmer? 
11 Were you aware that at some level the courts had rejected electoral challenges in 
12 those cases before December 14th? 
13 
14 A 
Q I assert the Fifth Amendment, please. Thank you. 
Meshawn Maddock gave an interview, I believe to Crossroads, a reporter 
15 associated has a YouTube channel and others, and during that --we have the recording. 
16 I believe it's exhibit No. 8. And we'll play that for you. 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 [Audio recording played.] 
BY 
Q We'll stop it there. 
Do you recognize that voice as being Meshawn Maddock? 
A Yeah, I do. 
Q And in there she said the Trump campaign --or, excuse me, I'll back up. 
23 She said, "We fought to seat the electors. The Trump campaign asked us to do that." 
24 Do you agree that the Trump campaign asked the Republican Party or parts of the 
25 Republican Party in Michigan, to seat the electors as Ms. Maddock said?  1 
2 A I assert my Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. 
Q Somewhat separately, we understand that the President called somebody 
3 named William Hartmann and Monica Palmer after the Wayne County certification in 
4 November. 
5 Do you know anything about those calls to Mr. Hartmann or Ms. Palmer? 27 
6 A I believe that the President called Monica Palmer. I can't speak to whether 
7 he called Bill Hartmann. And I know both people. 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 Q How do you know he called Ms. Palmer? 
A Because she said it. 
Q She say it to you? 
A She said it to the group. She's in the 14th District. 
Q What did she say to the group? 
A That the President spoke to her. 
Q Did she say anything about what happened on that call? 
A That's all I remember, that she got a call from the President. 
Q She didn't explain what the President said? 
A Well, it was all around the time about the --this was happening right after 
18 there was a canvassing incident. So that's all she said, as I recall, my memory is not 
19 perfect, is that the President called her. 
20 Q Okay. But she didn't elaborate and say the President told me this, or asked 
21 me this, or requested that we do this. Nothing like that? 
22 
23 A The only thing I remember is that the President called her. That's it. 
Q All right. And I understand that there is various levels of outreach to an 
24 individual named Aaron Van Langevelde who's on the State Board of Canvassers before 
25 the State met to certify the vote from Michigan.  1 Do you know anything about the outreach or pressure on Mr. Van Langevelde 
2 before that State certification? 
3 
4 A 
Q Not at all. I don't know anything about that. 
Is there anything that you --going back to the Monica Palmer call --when 
5 she told you and the group about that call, what do you remember her specifically 
6 saying? 
7 
8 
9 A That the President had called her. 
Q That's it? 
A You know, that I remember for sure, is that the President called her. 28 
10 Anything more just it would be speculation on my part and I don't want to do that. So I 
11 do remember she said that the President called her. 
12 
13 Q 
A Did she say if anybody else was involved in that call? 
I'm reaching back. I think that Ronna may --Ronna may --Ronna may have 
14 introduced the President to her on that call. I'm just --because I'm not positive, I'm not 
15 100 percent positive. 
16 Q Okay. Is that based on your memory of how she --how Ms. Palmer 
17 described the call? 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 A Just on the memory of that situation, that's how I remember it. 
Q All right. Ronna you mentioned. Ronna who? 
A RNC chair. 
Q Ronna McDaniel? 
A Yes. 
Q Do you remember anything else, whether her specific words or not, that she 
24 said or conveyed to the group about when she was also --when Ms. Palmer was also 
25 talking about this call from the President?  1 A No, I really don't. 
2 I'll just take a moment here. 
3 I know you've been on. I don't know if you have any follow-up 
4 questions to anything we've been over. 
5 I don't,. Thank you. 
6 Just give us one moment, Ms .. 
7 
8 
9 The Witness. Sure. 
I think we're wrapping up here. 29 
10 Q Have you talked to any of --anybody else, other than your lawyer, Mr. Blake, 
11 and I don't want to get into the substance of that --but have you talked to anybody else 
12 about your subpoena, your production of documents, or your appearance for deposition 
13 testimony? 
14 
15 
16 A 
Q 
A Have I spoken with anyone? 
Correct. 
Okay. I've spoken with Kathy Berden, just let her know that I had received 
17 a subpoena. And I've spoken with Meshawn Maddock to let her know that I received a 
18 subpoena. 
19 
20 
21 Q 
A 
Q Anybody else? 
No. Everyone's been seeing it in the paper. So, no. 
When you spoke to Ms. Berden, did you talk about how you would approach 
22 your production of documents or testimony to the select committee? 
23 A No, I did not speak with her regarding production of documents or my 
24 testimony. I just told her I don't know why they're subpoenaing me. That's all. We 
25 just talked about that. We couldn't understand what value we would have to this  1 commission. 
2 Q What about Ms. Maddock? Did you talk to her about how or whether to 
3 produce documents or testimony to the select committee? 
4 A Did not speak with her regarding documents. I told her, as I told Kathy, I 
5 didn't have anything. And testimony, did not go over testimony at all. That was it. 
6 Okay. I'll ask one more time, - if you have anything 
7 before we conclude here. 
8 
9 
10 I don't,. No, thank you. 
All right. Very well. 
Then at this time, I think we've reached the end of the deposition. I appreciate 
11 you, Ms. Rodriguez and Mr. Blake, for showing up. I apologize for the technical 
12 difficulties that we're having. Sometimes this isn't always the easiest with virtual 
13 depositions. But I appreciate you being here. 30 
14 We are going to leave for purposes of procedure the deposition open at this time, 
15 and I'll be in touch with you, Mr. Blake, about that. But at this point we can go off the 
16 record. 
17 [Whereupon, at 4:46 p.m., the deposition was recessed, subject to the call of the 
18 chair.]  1
