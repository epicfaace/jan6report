5 House Select Committee to investigate the January 6th 
6 attack on the United States Capitol, pursuant to House 
7 Resolution 503. 
8 At this time I'd ask the witness to please 
9 state your full name and spell your last name for the 
10 record. 
11 THE WITNESS. Nicholas Quested. That's 
12 Q-u-e-s-t-e-d. 
13 BY 
14 Q Thank you, Mr. Quested. This will be a 
15 staff-led interview, and members, of course, may choose 
16 to also ask questions. 
1 7 In the room today we have 
18 that's me, investigative counsel. We have-
19 investigative counsel; investigative 
2 0 counsel; , professional staff member. We 
21 do not have any members in the room today or present 
22 virtually. 
2 3 There is an official reporter transcribing  1 the record of this interview. Please wait, 
2 Mr. Quested, until each question is completed before 
3 you begin your response, and we will try to wait until 
4 your response is complete before we ask our next 
5 question. 
6 The stenographer cannot record nonverbal 
7 responses, such as shaking your head, so it's important 
8 that you answer each question with an audible verbal 
9 response. 
10 Do you understand that, Mr. Quested? 
11 
12 A 
Q Yes. 
We ask that you provide complete answers 
13 based on your best recollection. If the question is 
14 not clear, then please just ask me for a clarification. 
15 And if you do not know the answer to a question that 
16 one of us asks, please just say so. 
1 7 I also want to remind you that it is unlawful 
18 to deliberately provide false information to Congress. 
19 For this interview, providing false information could 
2 0 result in criminal penalties for false statements. 
21 Do you understand that? 
22 
23 A 
Q Yes. 
Logistically please let us know if you need 4  1 any breaks or would like to discuss anything off the 
2 record. There may be several people asking you 
3 questions today, so, again, if you don't understand, 
4 please just simply ask one of us to repeat. 
5 So, Mr. Quested, we're going to start with 
6 some background. Can you please just tell us where you 
7 live, how old you are. 
8 A I'm 52 years old. I live in New York. I 
9 have a small farm in Upstate New York, in the Hudson 
10 Valley. 
11 
12 Q 
A What is your educational background? 
I was educated in London. I came to America 
13 for university. I graduated from NYU with a joint 
14 honors degree in French literature and film. 
15 Q 
16 Mr. Quested? 
17 
18 
19 A 
Q 
A What do you currently do for a living, 
I make documentaries. 
Have you always made documentaries? 
No. I've consistently made documentaries 
2 0 through my career, but I'm probably best known for 
21 directing music videos. I've directed over 100 music 
2 2 videos for most of the notable rappers there are, from 
2 3 Dr. Dre to Puffy, to Ice Cube, to Snoop Dagg, to Trick 5  6 
1 Daddy, to Trina --sorry. I have to do that quickly. 
2 My apologies. 
3 Dr. Dre, Nas, Puffy, Trick Daddy, Trina, 
4 Timbaland, Master P, Cash Money. 
5 I can go on for a while. 
6 Q But what kind of documentaries do you make 
7 now? 
8 A We do two types of documentaries. We do 
9 reportage documentaries. My partner, Sebastian Junger, 
10 we made a film called Restrepo that was nominated for 
11 an Oscar. We spent 15 months in the Korengal Valley 
12 doing a portrait of the deployment of the 173rd 
13 Airborne. And so we do films like that. 
14 We made a film about a friend and colleague, 
15 Tim Hetherington, who was killed in Libya. 
16 We made a film about traumatic stress called 
1 7 The Last Patrol. 
18 And then we did two documentaries, one about 
19 the war in Syria and Iraq called Hell of Earth, which 
2 0 we won a du Pont Award for, and a variety of others. 
21 And --where we tried to explain in simple terms the 
22 origins of the conflict in Syria and Iraq and the human 
2 3 cost.  1 And then we made a film about --called Blood 
2 on the Wall about the political realities of life in 
3 Mexico at the moment, how Mexico got to where it is, 
4 and creates a parallel between migration and narcotics. 
5 We followed the caravan from Guatemala all the way into 
6 America, and then we followed the opium from the field 
7 to a motel in Downtown Los Angeles. 
8 -can you pull up 
9 Exhibit 1, please? 
1 O THE WITNESS. The other part is we make films 
11 about public culture, so we have a film coming out this 
12 spread around the world with mixed tapes. 
13 BY 
14 Q So this is Exhibit 1. This is your bio. 
15 Can you please just scan it real quickly and 
16 let us know if this is --
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
2 2 business. 
23 Q Yeah, that's it. 
--an accurate bio? 
Yes. It's old, but it's accurate. 
Are you still with Goldcrest Films? 
Goldcrest is my company. It's a family 
Okay. 7  1 A Goldcrest is a venerable film production 
2 company. In our library --as a production company we 
3 would make Gandhi, Chariots of Fire, The Killing 
4 Fields, A Room With a View, Hope and Glory, The 
5 Mission, and most notably or most successfully, All 
6 Dogs Go To Heaven. 
7 Q Thank you, Mr. Quested. 
8 We can take that down. Awesome. 
9 So let's go now to some of the topics that 
10 are more relevant to January 6. 
11 Did you become acquainted with Mr. Tarrio in 
12 December 2020, Enrique Tarrio, that is? 
13 
14 A 
Q 
15 Mr. Tarrio? 
16 A Yes. 
Could you tell us how you got connected with 
I was connected through a colleague of mine, 
1 7 Kathryn Gilbert. Kathryn Gilbert's husband is Josh 
18 Goldstein. Josh Goldstein is a former SEAL. He has 
19 extensive Tier 1 contacts. Kathryn came up with a 
2 0 number for Enrique that I called. 
21 Q Why were you interested in getting connected 
22 with Mr. Tarrio? 
23 A We were making a film about how America was 8  1 so divided when Americans have so much in common. And 
2 we spent some time on the various protests through the 
3 summer and started to see the rise in the acerbic 
4 rhetoric of both sides. And so we felt that we wanted 
5 to try and tell the story in extremis, as in we could 
6 look at Proud Boys and BLM and Antifa and see what 
7 common arguments that they have, or common grievances 
8 they have. 
9 Q And how did Mr. Tarrio fit into this 
10 documentary or film that you were producing at the 
11 time? 
12 A Well, Mr. Tarrio is the --or was the leader 
13 of the Proud Boys at the time. And I thought it was an 
14 interesting, the fact that he's Cuban American and of 
15 darker skin was an interesting irony for a 
16 prate-fascist street militia. 
17 Q Did Ms. Gilbert or her husband give you any 
18 background on Mr. Tarrio when you reached out to him 
19 the first time? 
20 
21 A 
Q No, I --no. 
So then can you walk us through your first 
22 interaction with Mr. Tarrio. You said you called him. 
2 3 How did that phone conversation go? 9  1 A It was very informal. He was like, Okay. 
2 Good cool. Come down. I like your film. That was 
3 great. 
4 And so we came down. We agreed to meet on 
5 November 11 outside the Phoenix Hotel where we had an 
6 informal conversation. And then I was with the core 
7 members of the Proud Boys there. There was, you 
8 know --
9 
10 
11 
12 Q 
A 
Q 
13 call to him? 
14 A Sorry to interrupt. Sorry to 
Was it November 11 or December 11? 
Sorry. December 11, sorry. 
And approximately when did you make the phone 
Oh, probably some time towards the end of 
15 late November. Probably before Thanksgiving. 
16 Q Got it. Okay. 
1 7 So you were saying you met with him, it 
18 sounds like on December 11 --
19 
20 
21 
22 
2 3 off. A 
Q 
A 
Q Yes. 
--in Washington, D.C.? 
Yes. 
Okay. Please continue. I'm sorry to cut you 10  11 
1 A No problem. 
2 There was --so they were drinking outside of 
3 the Phoenix Hotel at a bar called the Dubliner. Yeah, 
4 the Dubliner, I think. 
5 And then they had to bring their own alcohol 
6 because it was COVID restrictions at the time. And it 
7 was, you know, a boisterous affair of, you know --it 
8 felt like --it felt like a rugby club at that time. 
9 Q What were your impressions of Mr. Tarrio when 
10 you first met him in person on December 11th, it sounds 
11 like? 
12 A My first impression was he was an affirmable, 
13 personable guy. He was not --he didn't really have an 
14 
15 opinion of us. He was just like, Here, you are. It's 
16 all good. 
1 7 He introduced us to some of his people and we 
18 had discussions about this. So sort of tried to 
19 establish our bona fide journalistic credentials. Like 
2 0 we mentioned Restrepo a lot because a lot of them are 
21 veterans, and we try to find commonalty as quickly as 
22 we can with people. 
2 3 There was a guy from Pittsburgh. I always go  1 with "Mean" Joe Greene, you know, ball of steel. 
2 That's always a good one. 
3 Q 
4 comment. 
5 
6 A 
Q As a Steelers' fan, I appreciate that 
It's always good. 
So at that time with Mr. Tarrio, is it safe 
7 to say that your prior films allowed you to build 
8 rapport with him pretty quickly? 
9 
10 A 
Q Absolutely. 
So what were you in D.C. for that, I guess, 
11 on December 11th? What did Mr. Tarrio say was going on 
12 inD.C.atthetime? 
13 A Well, there was going to be a rally the next 
14 day. I'm not quite sure. I mean, I've heard this 
15 rally being called several different things, whether it 
16 be the "Million MAGA 2" or "Stop the Steal." But the 
1 7 idea was that there was going to be a night march and a 
18 prayer. And then the next day there was going to be a 
19 daytime march and a nighttime march. 
2 0 There was definitely --there was definitely 
21 a subtext that the second night march was going to be 
22 more aggressive than the November 14th. They were here 
2 3 to take back their streets. 12  1 Q So on December 11th it was going to be a 
2 night march and a prayer. And then on December 12 it 
3 was going to be a day march and a night march; is that 
4 correct? 
5 
6 A 
Q Yes. 
So was the first event that you attended with 
7 the Proud Boys on December 11th the prayer meeting that 
8 you just mentioned? 
9 A Yeah. There was a lot of marching around as 
10 well. There wasn't as many Proud Boys as the next day, 
11 but there was quite a few. They tried to walk in a 
12 line down the Mall, generally unsuccessfully. But 
13 there was a lot of walking up and down the Mall. 
14 Q And I'm going to ask you this question 
15 throughout your interview here today, but what was the 
16 general feeling or mood as you were with the Proud Boys 
1 7 on December 11th? 
18 A The general feeling was kind of --I felt 
19 that --there was not euphoria, but there was an 
2 0 excitement to those rallies. Like, people were 
21 positive. I mean, the rhetoric was --the rhetoric 
2 2 from Ta rrio was, If you want a war, then you've got 
2 3 one. We won't be trod on. 13  1 You know, the --it's a --there's not 
2 much --he was --so he was building excitement within 
3 his group. And close to him was --on that day was 
4 particularly Spaziola and Biggs and Nordean and Zach 
5 Rehl. That was very obvious that they were close. And 
6 also Jeremy Bertino. 
7 Q And those individuals that you just listed, 
8 did they go to the prayer event on December 11? 
9 
10 A 
Q Yes. 
Can you describe just in general what this 
11 prayer meeting consisted of, or prayer/gathering 
12 consisted of? 
13 A It consisted of a speech from Enrique on the 
14 bullhorn, you know, refusing to talk about the stolen 
15 election and that they wouldn't, they weren't prepared 
16 to take it. 
1 7 And then it consisted to --I think --I 
18 don't remember what the prayer was at night. I 
19 remember the prayer was led by --during the day, the 
2 0 next day was led by a guy called Yoda from Colorado, 
21 which was another African American Proud Boy, which was 
2 2 a bit muddled, the prayer, I felt. 
23 BY 14  1 Q You mentioned earlier that part of the core 
2 group that he was close to, one of them was Spaziola. 
3 A Yeah, I have a picture of Spaziola next to 
4 him. 
5 Q From what you observed, could you describe 
6 that relationship? Or were they conversing a lot? 
7 A No, I think Spaziola was there, was very 
8 supportive. And I didn't see much conversation. 
9 just saw a proximity. I saw a proximity. 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 Q 
A 
Q But it was clear that they knew each other? 
Oh, absolutely. 
So in the prior meeting you mentioned some of 
15 the things that Tarrio was talking about, but it didn't 
16 sound like there was actually religious content in 
1 7 that? 
18 A There was religious content, but I kind of 
19 feel that the religious content is in a --sort of an 
2 0 assuagement to --I don't think it's a core tenet of 
21 their belief. It's like an add-on. 
2 2 It was particularly notable during his speech 
2 3 that he waited --he forgot to mention the 2A aspect to 15  16 
1 their struggle. So he just sort of tacked that on in 
2 the end. And you won't take our guns, which I thought 
3 was like, you know, is not obviously not part of his 
4 struggle and just felt it was a buzz point to take off 
5 on his speech. 
6 Q So was there actual prayer at this prayer 
7 meeting? 
8 A There was a prayer subsequent to that, a 
9 brief prayer. More like a grace almost. 
1 O Got it. 
11 BY 
12 Q On December 11th --and I'm also going to ask 
13 you this question throughout --do you recall 
14 Mr. Tarrio being around or talking to Mr. Roger Stone? 
15 A Yes. They had a --Roger Stone came out to 
16 the hotel that's just --it's close to the Willard. Is 
1 7 it the Hyatt? It has columns in front of it. 
18 And it was --it felt like a pep rally. 
19 Roger came out and stood on the --just where there's 
2 0 like a planters or something, and addressed the crowd 
21 very briefly. The crowd shouted his name. And it 
22 was --you know, it was a little bizarre, frankly. 
23 Q We're going to play a clip of what I believe  1 is the time that Mr. Stone came out with Mr. Tarrio on 
2 December 11. So we're going to play Exhibit 2. And 
3 we're just going to play the first minute of Exhibit 2. 
4 (Video played) 
5 THE WITNESS. There's a Proud Boy, and 
6 there's Tarrio. 
7 While we're playing the 
8 video --
9 THE WITNESS. Sorry. 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 Q (Video played) 
Thank you. 
BY 
I believe, Mr. Quested, you were telling us 
15 who was in the video. Can you now list off the folks 
16 that you remember? 
1 7 First of all, was this the speech that you 
18 remember seeing on December 11? 
19 A Yes, yes. 
2 0 I was behind them actually. If you took 
21 three steps back. I think I got in the way of my own 
22 camera. So that was why I sort of stepped back. 
23 Q Okay. And can you tell us who is around 17  1 Mr. Stone at this time? 
2 A Yes. From left to right, that is Ethan 
3 Nordean, Enrique Tarrio, and then Roger Stone. 
4 Q And do you know who that is speaking, the 
5 person in this video? Did you know who that was at the 
6 time speaking? 
7 
8 
9 A 
Q 
A No, I don't remember. 
Did Mr. Stone actually speak at this event? 
Briefly. But only with --probably just to 
10 thank the crowd. I don't recall exactly. I felt the 
11 crowd reacted to him in a very positive way, and I 
12 think he, you know, enjoyed that. 
13 Q Approximately what time was this as well, 
14 approximately? 
15 A Approximately 11:00. I don't know. It was 
16 at the end of the night. It had been a long day. 
17 Q Okay. And can you just give us a sense of 
18 the overall scene? We can see the number of people 
19 here that appear to be watching Mr. Tarrio, 
2 0 Mr. Nordean, Mr. Stone. But can you give us a sense 
21 from your picture of what the scene was like at this 
22 time? 
23 A Yes. So there's probably 2-, 300 people. 18  1 And it wasn't just Proud Boys. There was a crowd there 
2 for some other reason. I'm not quite sure. We sort of 
3 turned up there. 
4 Q Do you recall any of the messaging that was 
5 being said at this event? 
6 
7 A 
Q No. 
Okay. Do you recall Mr. Tarrio talking about 
8 any communications or interactions you had with 
9 Mr. Stone on December 11? 
10 A No. 
11 Does anyone have any 
12 follow-up about Mr. Stone in particular before we move 
13 on to the next part of this event? Okay. 
14 BY 
15 
16 
17 
18 Q 
A 
Q 
A So then can we fast forward to the 4:30 mark. 
I can add one thing. 
Yes, please. 
When I first called Enrique Tarrio's phone, 
19 his answer phone message was Roger Stone saying, This 
2 0 is Enrique Tarrio's phone. If he's not here, he's out 
21 there kicking ass and doing something good for America. 
22 Q What were your initial thoughts when you 
2 3 called Mr. Tarrio and Mr. Stone was the voice on his 19  1 voice mail? 
2 A I thought that was --I thought it was 
3 like --first of all, I thought it was one of those 
4 things that you hire people to do. What's that called? 
5 
6 Q 
A Cameo? 
Cameo, yeah, I thought he got a cameo, 
7 because Roger Stone --you know, if you've ever done --
8 if you've ever been to his website, you can buy 
9 anything from his website, whether it's a Roger Stone, 
10 like a signed stone, which is 25 bucks, or a T-shirt 
11 with "Free Roger Stone," everything revolves around 
12 some type of, you know, merchandise. 
13 Q And you said that this event took place next 
14 to the Willard. Was that the JW Marriott? 
15 A Yes. As you can see in the background, 
16 there's Freedom Plaza. And so yes, the JW Marriott, 
1 7 and then the Willard is one block over, I believe. 
18 Q Got it. Let's go to the 4:30 mark of this 
19 same exhibit, Exhibit 2, I believe. 
2 0 (Video played) 
21 BY 
22 Q Do you know who this individual is speaking 
2 3 on this part of the video? 20  1 
2 A 
Q Is that Owen Shroyer? 
Yes. 
3 So do you recall this part of the video when 
4 Mr. Shroyer came up and was next to Mr. Tarrio giving a 
5 speech? 
6 
7 A 
Q Yes. 
I guess what, if anything, stood out about 
8 this part of the event? 
9 A At this point I'm phasing out Owen Shroyer as 
10 much as I can possibly in my life. 
11 Q Okay. So nothing really stood out to you 
12 about this part? 
13 
14 A 
Q No. It just is a blur of hate and vitriol. 
Do you recall Mr. Tarrio saying anything 
15 about Mr. Shroyer after or before this event? 
16 
17 A 
Q No. 
During this clip it looks like Mr. Tarrio is 
18 on his phone the entire time. Is that something that 
19 was pretty consistent with Mr. Tarrio, that he was on 
20 his phone? 
21 A Yes. He was a --he was an avid 
22 communicator. 
23 Q And when you say "avid communicator," does 21  22 
1 that mean like taking phone calls, texting, internet, 
2 everything? 
3 A I don't know what he was doing on his phone. 
4 But it was mostly --it was mostly not to his ear. It 
5 was mostly in his hands. 
6 Q Okay. Got it. Thank you. 
7 I guess on December 11th, do you know where 
8 the Proud Boys were staying for these events in D.C.? 
9 A I think that they would split between the 
10 Phoenix Hotel and Harry's, the Harrington Hotel. I 
11 don't think that anyone really wanted to stay --the 
12 rank and file stayed at the Harrington because it's --
13 it doesn't have the best reputation as a hotel, shall 
14 we say. 
15 Q Are you aware of the Proud Boys receiving any 
16 financial assistance to travel and stay in the hotels 
1 7 in D.C.? 
18 A No, but I am aware that Enrique Tarrio 
19 traveled by private jet to the --to several of these 
2 0 rallies. 
21 Q Do you know how he was able to procure a 
2 2 private jet to travel to some of these rallies? 
23 A I think he was invited by Patrick Byrne.  1 
2 
3 too. 
4 Q 
A 
Q I guess --
And I think Bianca Gracia was on that plane 
I guess can you help us, if you can, just 
5 help us understand how you came to that conclusion or 
6 came to that thought. 
7 A That's subsequent, and that I learned that 
8 subsequently as I've been doing --we are making a film 
9 about the 64 days, and that was part of our 
10 investigation. 
11 Q Did you receive any financial assistance from 
12 the Proud Boys or any group to come down to document 
13 December 11th and December 12th? 
14 A No. 
15 Any follow-up from that? 
16 Seeing no follow-up. 
1 7 BY 
18 Q So let's move on to --actually, before I 
19 move on, did anything else of note happen on 
2 0 December 11th that I failed to cover? 
21 A On December 11th? No. I think we covered 
22 December 11th. 
23 Q All right. So on December 12th when you woke 23  1 up that morning, what was the plan for the day? 
2 A The plan for the day was a late morning walk, 
3 march on the Mall. I think we met, again, at --I 
4 think we met, again, at the Phoenix, and then walked 
5 across to Harry's, and then walked to the Mall. 
6 Q Approximately what time was this? You said 
7 11:30. Approximately what time did you meet at the 
8 Phoenix? 
9 A 11:00-ish. I was trying --Enrique mentioned 
10 that he was going to the White House that morning, and 
11 I did my very best to try and insert myself into that 
12 meeting, which he politely declined. 
13 Q So you asked Mr. Tarrio if you could go with 
14 him to the White House? 
15 
16 A 
Q Oh, multiple times. 
Approximately what time did Mr. Tarrio leave 
1 7 you to go to the White House? 
18 A I know he went before the meeting. He went 
19 in the early, early-ish morning. 
2 0 Can we pull up Exhibit 3, 
21 please, Jacob. Can we scroll down. 
22 BY 
23 Q So this is a Reuters' article about 24  1 Mr. Tarrio's visit to the White House. Unfortunately, 
2 the pictures aren't working on this exhibit, but did 
3 Mr. Tarrio send you any proof or anything that 
4 indicated he was at the White House that morning? 
5 A Yeah. He sent me a picture of himself in 
6 front of the White House. 
7 Q And for the record, I believe the picture, 
8 having seen it with Mr. Quested, that Mr. Tarrio sent 
9 is the same photo that matches the Reuters' article of 
10 Mr. Tarrio in front of the White House. 
11 So Mr. Tarrio tours the White House, it 
12 appears that morning. And then you meet up with him 
13 for the first time at around 11:30 that morning? 
14 
15 
16 A 
Q 
A Yes. 
And then where did you all go from there? 
We walked across to Harry's bar, where there 
1 7 were more Proud Boys, and we walked to the Mall. And, 
18 again, there was another prayer session. There was a 
19 lot more Proud Boys this time. And there was another 
2 0 speech and another prayer. 
21 And then we probably finished around 2:00. 
2 2 And we went to get something to eat, and then took a 
2 3 nap preparing for the evening because we felt that 25  1 there was --you know, we were preparing for the 
2 evening. We felt that there would potentially be a 
3 kinetic situation that evening. They were --they 
4 feel --they felt riled up at this point. 
5 Q So let's break that down a little bit. 
6 You said there were more Proud Boys compared 
7 to the night before, day before. Can you give us an 
8 approximate number difference between the Proud Boys on 
9 December 11th and the Proud Boys on December 12th? 
10 A Yes. I'd say 100 to 150 on the evening. And 
11 then, I think, 2-to 300, and maybe even more, in the 
12 evening. I could say there were maybe 400 Proud Boys 
13 there. 
14 Q So how many were on the 11th, just to be 
15 clear? 
16 A I'd say 2-to 300 during the day. And I'd 
1 7 say, you know, 400 for the evening. It felt 
18 significantly more people in the evening. 
19 Q 
2 0 right now? 
21 
22 A 
Q Right. So you're talking about the 12th 
Yes. 
And then compared to that, how many did you 
2 3 see on the 11th, the day before? 26  1 
2 
3 
4 A 
Q 
A 
Q Like 100 to 150. 
Thank you. 
It was a good number, but not --it swelled. 
So on that morning, I know you said you 
5 walked around D.C. Did you all go to Freedom Plaza at 
6 all on December 12? 
7 A Yes. We went to the speeches on Freedom 
8 Plaza, and Enrique was meant to speak and then didn't 
9 speak, and then we left. 
10 Q What did he say, if anything, about that 
11 speaking situation, where he was supposed to speak but 
12 didn't speak? 
13 A He said, It was a shit show and I didn't have 
14 time for this. 
15 Q Did he say who had coordinated with him to 
16 speak on December 12? 
17 
18 A 
Q No. 
Do you recall if the event on December 12th 
19 at Freedom Plaza was the event hosted by Women for 
2 0 America First? 
21 
22 A 
Q Yes. 
So Mr. Tarrio was under the impression that 
2 3 he would be speaking at the Women for America First 27  1 event on December 12? 
2 
3 A 
Q Yes. 
You mentioned when we previously talked that 
4 you all also went to a stage hosted by Mr. Dustin 
5 Stockton; is that correct? 
6 A Oh, yes. Sorry. Yes. We went to that on 
7 the 12th too. I think --I can't remember if that was 
8 before or after the Freedom Plaza rally. 
9 
10 Q 
A Where was the stage compared --
We also went in Freedom Plaza as the 
11 President flew over in the helicopters. So that's a 
12 time stamp for you. 
13 Q What was the general feeling of the crowd 
14 when President Trump flew over the Freedom Plaza? 
15 
16 A 
Q There was a wave of excitement. 
What was Mr. Tarrio's response to the former 
1 7 President flying over, if any? 
18 
19 A 
Q Fuck yeah. 
Where was Mr. Stockton's stage in comparison 
2 0 to the Freedom Plaza stage? 
21 
22 A 
Q It was on the other side of the monument. 
Approximately how many people were at 
2 3 Mr. Stockton's stage, if you recall? 28  1 A It was less populated than the Freedom --the 
2 Freedom Plaza rally was very well attended. There were 
3 lots of people. It was hard to push through the crowd. 
4 It was all sorts of your typical, as I say 
5 typical, but the MAGA community came out in force for 
6 that event. You saw the same --you see the South 
7 Vietnamese generals with the flags and the T-shirt 
8 shops and the --there was less of that --I don't 
9 know, less of the MAGA crowd at the Dustin Stockton 
10 rally on the other side. It was more than a few 
11 people, but it was nicely situated because the 
12 topography worked well for the stage. 
13 So there's a hill that goes up to the 
14 monument, feeds nicely into the stage that was there. 
15 So you could have a lot of people seeing what was going 
16 on without people being too crowded. 
17 
18 Q 
A Did Mr. Tarrio speak at Mr. Stockton's stage? 
I don't remember. I think so. And I think 
19 Biggs had a moment too. 
20 Q Did you all go to any rallies on the Mall as 
21 well on December 12th, like a Jericho March, for 
22 example? 
23 A No. 29  1 Q And then you said you took a break at some 
2 point in the afternoon; is that correct? 
3 
4 A 
Q Yes. 
And you also mentioned that you had a feeling 
5 that individual Proud Boys were resting up because 
6 there might be a kinetic situation that evening on 
7 December 12th? 
8 A That was definitely the plan, was to take it 
9 easy. Don't drink too much and we'll see you in the 
10 evening. 
11 Q And who was the kinetic situation going to be 
12 with, from what you could gather? 
13 A Well, they were preparing to confront Antifa 
14 and BLM. 
15 Q So I guess walk us through that night then. 
16 What happened? When did you reconnect with the Proud 
1 7 Boys and what did you all do? 
18 A I think we reconnected around 7:00 or 8:00 in 
19 the evening. We walked over again from Harry's bar to 
2 0 the Harrington. There was a big meeting at the 
21 Harrington Hotel. And then we went marching again, and 
22 we went marching towards BLM Plaza. 
2 3 We walked around the streets, trying to 30  31 
1 outflank the police that had come this time in force. 
2 So we would go to the BLM Plaza, and then we would go 
3 around the block. And then --I know that there was 
4 certain groups of Proud Boys that separated from the 
5 central group, and there were scuffles amongst those 
6 people. But the core group was basically confronting 
7 BLM and shouting over the police at BLM. 
8 Q What were you thinking as it seems like the 
9 Proud Boys were approaching --or trying to approach 
10 Black Lives Matter protesters on the evening of 
11 December 12? 
12 A It felt like they were --it felt like they 
13 wanted to have a scuffle, but they didn't really want 
14 to have a scuffle, you know. Like hold me back, hold 
15 me back, and then you got the police in the middle. 
16 So I felt --I didn't feel it was a serious 
1 7 attempt to engage in street violence. 
18 Q What were the Proud Boys mostly wearing, if 
19 anything, of note? 
20 A They were very resplendent in the black and 
21 gold colors of the Proud Boys. It was a thing. There 
22 was people wearing black and gold kilts. There were 
2 3 black and gold gators. There were many polo shirts of  1 black with gold trimmings. Black and gold was a thing. 
2 A lot of patches, you know. And I've learned 
3 that the patches --oh, there was also --there was 
4 also a motif of T-shirts with RWDS on it, which I later 
5 found to be --mean Right Wing Death Squad, and free 
6 helicopter ride T-shirts, and Pinochet was right. So 
7 there was an element of that type of political comment 
8 in their attire. 
9 And also --I also learned that Enrique sells 
10 a lot of these elements at his web shop and in Miami. 
11 He has a T-shirt shop. 
12 Q I guess on December 12th, did you all see 
13 Mr. Roger Stone that day, that you recall? 
14 
15 A 
Q I don't recall, no. 
What was the Proud Boys' general role during 
16 these rallies or while walking around on December 12th? 
1 7 Were they providing personal security details or what 
18 was their role? 
19 A I didn't see them providing personal security 
2 0 to anyone because I was following them as they marched. 
21 But I am under the impression that they did provide 
22 certain security services to speakers and dignitaries 
2 3 from this community. 32  1 Q Did they speak of any people in particular 
2 that they were providing security for on this day? 
3 
4 A 
Q No. 
But you didn't personally see them providing 
5 security detail? 
6 
7 A 
Q No. 
Did you see any Oath Keepers with Proud Boys 
8 while you were in D.C. on December 12th? 
9 
10 A 
Q No. 
Going back to the White House tour that you 
11 mentioned earlier, did Mr. Tarrio tell you how --or 
12 how he ended up getting invited to the White House on 
13 December 12th? 
14 
15 A 
Q No. 
Did he tell you who arranged for him to go on 
16 the White House visit? 
17 
18 A 
Q 
19 House visit? 
20 A No. 
Did he tell you anything after the White 
I asked him, and he said, Yeah, it was one of 
21 the coolest things I've done. 
2 2 But it was not a --there was not much 
2 3 substance to what he --he didn't, you know, he sent me 33  1 a picture of him on the steps of an entrance to the 
2 White House. 
3 Q Did Mr. Tarrio say that he met with former 
4 President Trump during this visit? 
5 A I don't recall, but I think so. I don't 
6 recall. I couldn't speak accurately on that. 
7 
8 Q 
A Okay. 
I think he implied that and didn't say that. 
9 Let's just say that. 
10 Q Okay. You described the kinetic situation 
11 and the Proud Boys walking around D.C. on the night of 
12 the 12th. Did you observe any violence at all 
13 involving the Proud Boys on December 12th? 
14 A Yeah. There was several moments where there 
15 was scuffles that --there was little scuffles, pushing 
16 with the police. But the police were very restrained 
1 7 generally and very well organized and quite calm. The 
18 police were very calm at this point, I have to say. 
19 And I do remember joking with one police 
2 0 officer and asking, Is this like this every night? 
21 And he kind of smiled and just... 
22 So I don't think the police felt massively 
2 3 intimidated by the Proud Boys at this point. And 34  35 
1 then --so the moment at the end is the interesting 
2 point. 
3 So everyone comes back, and we've been 
4 walking around. And, you know, we walked a long way. 
5 And I was wearing proper protective equipment. And 
6 that is heavy and probably weighs 30 pounds. I have a 
7 proper ballistic vest that I've used in conflict zones. 
8 It has a collar. It stretches down past my solar 
9 plexus, below my waist. It's heavy. 
10 So I remember knocking on one of the Proud 
11 Boys' plate carrier, his ballistic vest, and I was 
12 like, Oh, that's not Kevlar. What's that? 
13 And he goes, Oh, yeah, it's so if we get 
14 caught with a ballistic vest and we're fighting in 
15 D.C., then that's a six-month mandatory. So we take 
16 the ballistic plates out of the plate carriers and we 
1 7 replace them with a hard-cutting board, a plastic 
18 cutting board that's shaped like the plate, so it's not 
19 a ballistic quality. 
2 0 So it just shows that they were aware of the 
21 2A laws in D.C. 
2 2 But what I also was a little perplexed by is 
2 3 that they were very small vests. So if they are  36 
1 worried about being stabbed or shot, then they provided 
2 very little protection for your vital organs. 
3 So this leads into --we're back at the 
4 Harrington Hotel. It's probably 11:00 at this point. 
5 It's late. We were sort of winding down. They're 
6 finding it hard to get alcohol. I know that was a 
7 constant gripe. 
8 And there's suddenly --I remember I took my 
9 vest off because it was heavy. They said, Now what are 
10 we going to do? 
11 There was a whole bit of nothing, it felt 
12 like. And then suddenly there's a scuffle by the 
13 parking garage as you look up the hill from the 
14 Harrington. And Jeremy Bertino emerges clutching his 
15 side. And so I gave him some first aid. We put a 
16 bandage on it and waited for the paramedics. 
1 7 I remember there was a Proud Boy next to me 
18 and said, Don't put --don't --he's going to bleed 
19 into his body cavity. Don't do that. 
2 0 And I was like, I don't understand what 
21 you're talking about. Like, you stop the blood 
22 flowing. That's the first thing you do in any type of 
2 3 traumatic wound. And then wait for the real experts to  37 
1 come. 
2 So I gave first aid to Jeremy Bertino. 
3 Q So in describing this first aid situation 
4 with Mr. Bertino, and I guess the plate carriers that 
5 the Proud Boys were wearing on December 12th, can you 
6 compare, I guess, their readiness for this type of 
7 kinetic situation with the readiness you might have 
8 perceived in Afghanistan or Syria in your prior 
9 documentary filmmakers? Like how would you describe 
10 the Proud Boys' readinesses in general? 
11 A Naive and immature. They may have been ready 
12 to fight, but they weren't --they didn't have real 
13 protection for themselves. They didn't have proper 
14 PPE. They looked very vulnerable to me as a fighting 
15 force. 
16 Q So I know you mentioned that Mr. --you 
1 7 didn't see Mr. Tarrio or Proud Boys talking with 
18 Mr. Roger Stone on December 12th. Did you see them 
19 speak with Mr. Owen Shroyer? 
20 A I believe Mr. Shroyer was in Freedom Plaza. 
21 I don't recollect the substance of the conversation, 
22 though. 
23 Q Okay. And who was the conversation with; do  1 you remember? Was it Proud Boys in general or 
2 Mr. Tarrio specifically? 
3 A I just remember Shroyer being around. 
4 don't remember the interaction. 
5 Q And by "around," you're not talking about 
6 like a stage giving a speech, but around kind of in a 
7 crowd or in the streets of D.C.? 
8 A Yeah. He seemed to be separate from the 
9 stage. 
10 Q What about Mr.Alex Jones? Do you recall 
11 seeing any Proud Boys, Mr. Tarrio, interacting with him 
12 on December 12th? 
13 
14 
15 
16 A 
Q 
A 
Q No, I don't remember. 
Mr. Steve Bannon? 
No. 
Do you recall an Oath Keeper by the name of 
1 7 Mr. Kelly Meggs being around Mr. Tarrio on 
18 December 12th? 
19 
20 
21 
22 A 
Q 
A 
Q I wasn't aware of Mr. Meggs at that time. 
Okay. 
Is he in our footage? 
We can't answer any questions. I just wanted 
2 3 to see what your recollection was. 38  1 So you talked about previously how the Proud 
2 Boys were aware --in your opinion, the Proud Boys were 
3 aware of local laws and regulations because of the body 
4 armor situation. 
5 Did this go along with Mr. Tarrio being aware 
6 of the laws in your opinion? 
7 
8 A 
Q Absolutely, yes. 
And would you say that Mr. Tarrio would have 
9 been aware of, like, firearm regulations in addition to 
10 just body armor-type regulations? 
11 
12 
13 A 
Q 
A I think it's all the same. 
Okay. 
And if I was to --Enrique was very spritely. 
14 It doesn't feel like he had 30 pounds on him. 
15 Anyone have any follow-up 
16 questions about that? 
17 
18 
19 Q I was wondering if you could share any 
2 0 recollections you have about the way the Proud Boys 
21 were impacting with law enforcement on the night of the 
22 12th? 
23 A Yes. They were --they were challenging law 39  40 
1 enforcement to allow them to settle this, Just give us 
2 15 minutes and we'll sort this all out for you and 
3 there will be no more problems. 
4 They were respectful of the police. It felt 
5 like there was a line they didn't want to cross when it 
6 came to the police. They definitely didn't want to 
7 fight the police at this point. Although there were 
8 scuffles with the police, they were --they were 
9 mostly --it felt the police using a nonlethal --like 
10 a pepper spray or something and then there sort of 
11 would be a scuffle or something and then maybe some 
12 people got arrested. 
13 But it didn't feel --there was a general 
14 sense of continued respect for --there was some chants 
15 of "back the blue," as if that would convince the 
16 police to allow them to part ways and for them to go 
1 7 and attack the few protesters there were on BLM Plaza. 
18 They were definitely taunting the Proud Boys 
19 as well. 
20 Q And when those chants didn't work, did that 
21 affect --
22 A The level of frustration increased, but they 
2 3 never crossed that line.  1 Q Did you notice any changes in the way that 
2 they talked about law enforcement after as well? 
3 A No. I would have to wait for January 6th 
4 to --for that line to be crossed. 
5 Q And then earlier you talked about a Proud 
6 Boys' prayer gathering, but it sounds like, from what 
7 you said, it was not the Jericho March? 
8 A No. Well, I wasn't aware of the competing 
9 event of that day. 
10 
11 
12 Q 
A Got it. 
So what was the Proud Boys' prayer gathering? 
It was just a gathering of Proud Boys on the 
13 Mall during the day where they said a prayer. They did 
14 some more marching up and down the Mall, trying to keep 
15 in a straight line, which they're not very good at. 
16 Q Do you remember if it was sort of just 
1 7 religious or was it political? 
18 A Yes. Definitely blurred between the two. 
19 There's a conflagration of patriotism and religious 
2 0 aspects to the prayer and the speeches. 
21 
22 Q 
A Do you remember the themes or content? 
No. I just remember the guy that said it, 
2 3 because his name was Yoda. He was from Colorado and he 41  1 was black. 
2 And I was like I find African Americans in 
3 white supremest organizations to be somewhat 
4 perplexing. 
5 Q Got it. 
6 Just so I understand, was the prayer kind of 
7 nondenominational or was it specific? 
8 A Nondenominational, no. It was not a 
9 unitarian prayer. It felt very evangelical in its 
10 tone. I'm not a --that's supposition. I don't know, 
11 but it didn't feel --it was not thank-you all for 
12 being here, you know, as all brothers. It's not an 
13 Abrahamic prayer. 
14 It felt very Christian, let me put it that 
15 way. 
16 Q Got it. 
1 7 And you saw that being deeply combined with 
18 the patriotism and other calls related to --
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 A 
Q 
A Yes. 
--what was going on that day? 
Yeah, absolutely. 42  1 Q Is there anything else about the rallies or 
2 events on December 12th that I didn't cover that we 
3 should cover today? 
No. 4 
5 A 
Q So we're going to turn next into the Proud 
6 Boys' structure. 
8 well, my colleague, is going to ask you a 
9 few questions about what you perceived as the Proud 
10 Boys' structure, especially after spending some time 
11 with them in December. 
12 BY 
13 Q After you spent time with Mr. Tarrio and the 
14 Proud Boys in general, can you give us a sense of your 
15 impressions of how they were structured? 
16 A I felt there was Enrique as the obvious 
1 7 leader and spokesperson. And then below him was a 
18 clear structure of Nordean and Biggs, and I would say 
19 also Bertino. I would say they were key lieutenants to 
2 0 Enrique's captain ship. 
21 Q Did you ever hear them referred to as "the 
22 elders"? 
23 A Yeah. I heard --they were talking --this 43  1 as if there was a formal structure to the Proud Boys 
2 with these chapters and elders and pledges and oaths 
3 and charters, which I've subsequently researched. But 
4 at that time I just --they would talk about that. 
5 He's an elder from there, or he's from that 
6 chapter. And then there's politic chapters, and 
7 there's the Miami chapter and then the Tricity chapter. 
8 It felt, you know, sort of like Florida was very 
9 strongly represented. 
10 Q Did you get the sense that people from other 
11 chapters recognized and treated Mr. Tarrio as a 
12 national leader? 
13 A Yes, indeed. However, I don't think it was 
14 quite as unified as the Florida core chapter that he 
15 seemed to rely on closely. 
16 
17 Q 
A Can you elaborate on that? 
Yeah. There was some guys from North 
18 Carolina there. There was some guy. It just didn't --
19 it just seemed to have his core team around him. 
2 0 That's what I really mean. I don't really know about 
21 how they interacted. I'm just --they had his core 
22 team around, so I don't --
23 Q Sure. And it's based on your observations 44  1 when Mr. Tarrio issued a direction, would people from 
2 different chapters follow that direction? 
3 A Everyone followed the direction while at the 
4 rallies. I think the discussions would be about 
5 whether rallying was a good idea in the first place. 
6 Because it seemed to be a new concept that started in 
7 the summer of 2020. 
8 Q Can you share what you observed about those 
9 conversations? 
10 A That subsequent, that's some subsequent 
11 research that I observed the discussions about the 
12 merits of rallying. 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 Q 
Q Got it. 
Can I ask a follow-up there? 
Sure. 
BY 
Is it normal for you in your film-making 
18 profession to conduct research on the people that 
19 you're doing a documentary of? 
20 
21 A 
Q Yes, absolutely. That's what we do. 
I just wanted to confirm. It's not anything 
22 out of the norm to conduct research on the folks that 
2 3 you're possibly filming or working with? 45  46 
1 A You need to understand, when we make films, I 
2 need to understand what people's motivations are. We 
3 need to understand what they're telling us. We need to 
4 assess their veracity. 
5 We take a very journalistic approach to this. 
6 Like my partner Sebastian Junger often says, which we 
7 think is a journalistic --a journalist is often 
8 disappointed by his preconceptions. A good journalist 
9 is often disappointed by his preconceptions. 
10 So we may go in there with a working theory, 
11 but we may be disproved by that, by our research. And 
12 we will do as much as we possibly can to find out about 
13 the people that are our subjects, whether it's, you 
14 know, through sources or through open source research. 
15 Going off the record at 
16 11:04. 
1 7 (Recess) 
18 Back on the record at 11:19. 
19 BY 
20 Q So some people have characterized Mr. Tarrio 
21 as the chairman of the Proud Boys, but others have 
22 qualified that as saying that he served as a spokesman 
2 3 more than a leader.  1 Based off of what you observed, do you have a 
2 sense of whether there's a meaningful distinction 
3 between that, whether he was one or the other? 
4 A Well, in the context of the rallies on 
5 December 12th, Enrique felt very much the person 
6 directing everyone. So was he the spokesman and the 
7 leader, yes. Is there a differentiation between the 
8 two, I couldn't say outside of that rally. 
9 Q Got it. 
10 And in your other interactions with the Proud 
11 Boys, did you have a sense of whether he was a leader 
12 or a spokesman? 
13 A He was repeated to me to be the leader. 
14 That's why I went and reached out to him. I wasn't 
15 aware of the semantic arguments that they were having 
16 internally about "leader" or "spokesperson." 
17 Q Sure. 
18 And it appeared to you that other Proud Boys 
19 treated him as the leader? 
20 
21 A 
Q Absolutely. 
Great. 
22 Did you have a sense of how the chapters were 
2 3 organized? You mentioned a couple of different 47  1 chapters that you interacted with. 
2 A Yeah. Because there was a few chapters. 
3 There was the Houston Tricity Chapter. There was some 
4 from there. There was some from North Carolina. There 
5 was some from Southern Florida. Some from Northern 
6 Florida. 
7 And then on January 6th a group from Arizona 
8 turned up wearing orange hats. They were very 
9 conspicuous and grumpy. They were very serious. 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q This was on January 6th? 
That was on January 6th. 
Did you interact with that group? 
I try and interact with everyone. 
Well, I think we can get back to that when we 
15 get to January 6th. 
16 A I'm saying that's when I noticed this new 
1 7 group turning up who I hadn't seen before. 
18 Q Sure. 
19 I wanted to ask, right at the beginning of 
2 0 our interview you described the Proud Boys with the 
21 phrase "prate-fascist street militia," and later on you 
22 talked about how they kind of resembled a rugby club. 
2 3 So I want to understand how you get from rugby club to 48  1 prate-fascist street militia. 
2 A Yeah. Okay. So I felt they were --I mean, 
3 rugby club because the language was bawdy and, you 
4 know, there was a lot of jokes. There's a lot of very 
5 lewd and coarse language. That's what I mean from the 
6 rugby club. 
7 And then the prate-fascist street militia, 
8 that's what I felt like by the end of January 6th. So 
9 that might have been subsequent to my experiences 
10 around them that I would term them that. 
11 
12 Q 
A Sure. 
I felt they were football hooligans. I would 
13 have described them as football hooligans after 
14 December 12th. 
15 
16 Q 
A Okay. 
I mean, I was very --they --and I would say 
1 7 they --the symbolism of the white power symbol that 
18 they throw all the time, and they say, Oh, it's not, 
19 it's not a white power symbol, but they are obviously 
2 0 throwing it as if it is. So they like the idea of 
21 there being confusion for journalists and journalists 
22 becoming perplexed why they do this, where it's really 
2 3 very simple. It's just provocative. 49  1 And that was --that's part of the --that's 
2 part of it for me as well. 
3 Q Just for the sake of the transcript, you're 
4 making the "okay" symbol with your index finger and 
5 thumb and --
6 
7 A 
Q Indeed, yes. 
Did you have a sense of what united the Proud 
8 Boys across their different chapters and other certain 
9 forms of diversity that you saw within them, what held 
10 them together? 
11 A Well, there was --there's an obvious lack of 
12 diversity within them; although, there are isolated 
13 people of color within the Proud Boys. They have one 
14 Proud Boy, and they push him out as, like, We can't be 
15 racist. Here, there's a black person. Here is a black 
16 Proud Boy. 
1 7 And I'm like, I don't quite understand what 
18 you're saying to me. 
19 So --but they use that as another sort of 
2 0 element for themselves as an excuse. We couldn't 
21 possibly be, but now we throw a white supremest symbol 
22 and we push a --it's a tautology. 
23 Q Sure. 50  51 
1 So what in your view holds the Proud Boys 
2 together? 
3 A I think what holds is this sense of --this 
4 frustration with their --I think there's a general 
5 sense of frustration about their quality of life in 
6 America. They feel that they are not getting their 
7 fair share of what they are due, as Americans that 
8 have --are generationally American. And that they 
9 blame that on immigration, and they feel that the jobs 
10 that they should be getting are being taken by 
11 minorities and immigrants. 
12 And that also --1 mean, I've jumped forward. 
13 I had a conversation with a Proud Boy at the taco 
14 trucks on January 6th where I mentioned to him --he's 
15 eating a taco. And I was like, you know, if you stop 
16 the Mexicans coming, there's going to be less tacos. 
1 7 And he looked at me, and he takes a big bite 
18 and with a full mouth he goes, But I love tacos. 
19 So it's like there's an irony to their --you 
2 0 know, the fact that they feel like they're being 
21 replaced and marginalized, when they enjoy the benefits 
2 2 of the people that they are saying are marginalizing 
2 3 them.  1 Q Got it. 
2 And your sense of these feelings of --is it 
3 fair to characterize it as victim hood? 
4 
5 
6 
7 A 
Q 
A 
Q Absolutely. 
Grievance? 
Yes. 
And these are based off of your observations 
8 of their conversations? 
9 A Yes. They talk about --yeah. There's a lot 
10 of construction and manual labor jobs within their 
11 ranks of the Proud Boys. And I feel that they feel 
12 they work hard but don't get paid fairly. And they 
13 feel victimized because of that. 
14 Q And is that related to their support of 
15 President Trump, in your view? 
16 A I mean, President Trump has made a direct 
1 7 appeal to the blue collar white American, and said that 
18 he would address those grievances. I don't know if he 
19 was successfully --successfully able to do that, but I 
2 0 think part of his --a part of Trump's appeal is his 
21 ability to get people to vote against their own 
22 self-interest, which I find fascinating. 
23 Q How did you hear Proud Boys talking about 52  53 
1 Trump? 
2 A They talk about Trump in a very --as if he 
3 is the person that is here to save them. And is doing 
4 everything that they possibly can to fight against the 
5 globalists and the deep state and the establishment, 
6 they feel that is conspiring against all of them to 
7 keep them in poverty and --in poverty. Or not allow 
8 them to fully reach their potential. 
9 Q This sounds like it has some overlap with 
10 QAnon-related feelings. 
11 A Yeah. There were definitely some Q beliefs 
12 that seem to be held. Everyone believes that the 
13 election is stolen, like I think that would be a common 
14 belief amongst all the Proud Boys. There didn't seem 
15 to be any dissenting voices when we discussed this. 
16 And so yeah, there's elements of the QAnon 
1 7 theories that were prevalent within Proud Boys. But 
18 not necessary to the full extent that you saw some 
19 other people, but the tenets of that were infiltrated 
2 0 in their psyche, for sure. 
21 Q Got it. 
22 So it sounds like it wasn't necessarily that 
2 3 people were explicitly referencing Q, but that you  54 
1 heard those things and what they were saying? 
2 A Yes. People would reference Q as well, 
3 though. 
4 Q Got it. 
5 The Proud Boys' oath refers to western 
6 chauvinism. Did you ever hear anyone talk about what 
7 that term means? 
8 A I discussed that with Enrique, because I was 
9 like western chauvinism, does that include Europe? 
10 Because the type of values you're espousing don't fit 
11 in with the progressive, liberal, democratic system 
12 that is Europe. So is this just American western 
13 values, or is this liberal, democratic western values? 
14 So I don't think they really, you know, 
15 examined their messaging to, you know --in great 
16 detail. It seems to be pretty basic. 
17 Q Did you have a sense of how they were 
18 interpreting it? 
19 A Yeah. They interpreted it as, I'm not going 
2 0 to apologize for the original sins of America or 
21 anything beyond that. I'm going to just live my life 
22 however I want to live it and so what. Whatever. What 
2 3 are you going to do about it?  55 
1 Q Got it. 
2 Going back to kind of the tangible structure 
3 of the Proud Boys. You mentioned that Tarrio was the 
4 leader, that Joe Biggs and Ethan Nordean and Jeremy 
5 Bertino were under him. 
6 Is there anything else that you observed 
7 about the structure that we didn't cover? 
8 A No. There was some other elders or other 
9 leaders, but I didn't --they didn't seem to be --they 
10 were definitely present. You know, someone had 
11 mentioned him, but there's too many people for me to 
12 identify and --you know, there definitely were other 
13 groups there that had, you know, senior Proud Boys, but 
14 it felt like they were the cabinet of the Proud Boys. 
15 Q Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. 
16 Just two more quick kind of ideological 
1 7 questions. How did you --did you hear Proud Boys 
18 talking about women or gay people? 
19 A They --yes. So they would say, We don't 
2 0 have any problem with gay people, but then they would 
21 make --there was a few times it was --you know, this 
2 2 plays into the sense of victim hood. Like you're a 
2 3 very --you're a very handsome man. I'd fuck you.  1 
2 
3 
4 Q 
A That sort of repartee. 
Got it. 
So it was kind of used as a punchline? 
Yeah. It wasn't overtly anti-gay, though, 
5 like in the sense of, We're going to go, you know, 
6 fight these --fight gay people or --but they just, 
7 you know, they could be --they could be used for humor 
8 and self-assurance. 
9 
10 
11 Q 
A Got it. 
And women? 
A general misogynistic attitude of an 
12 all-male crowd that felt that it was their right to be 
13 able to demean women whenever they felt it was 
14 appropriate for their humor or --yeah. So --but 
15 nothing particularly --there's obviously very few 
16 women --there was a couple of Proud Boy women that 
1 7 seemed to be around, especially just before the 
18 stabbing incident. There were a few. There's like a 
19 group of --I don't know if they were all together, but 
2 0 there was a group of Proud Boy women, which I kind of 
21 find a little ironic. 
2 2 I don't know if they're Proud Boys or just 
2 3 with the Proud Boys, but they were wearing gold and 56  1 black and, you know, seemed to be very down with the 
2 team. 
3 
4 Q 
A Roughly how many would you say? 
Not very many. Like a half a dozen, maybe. 
5 Not very many. 
6 Q Did you get a sense that these were people 
7 who were in relationships with Proud Boys' members? 
8 
9 A 
Q Maybe. It may be. 
And then last question: Did you hear Proud 
10 Boys using racist language or antisemitic language? 
11 A No. Not --I can't remember --no, I don't 
12 recall that. 
13 Got it. 
14 I've hijacked this conversation, and I'll 
15 turn it back to 
16 Not at all. Not at all. 
1 7 Thank you, 
18 BY 
19 Q So I guess at the December rally throughout 
2 0 the end of December, or any time before January 6th, 
21 did you talk to Mr. Tarrio again? 
22 A Yeah. I texted him some photographs. 
2 3 texted Zach Rehl some photographs and tried to continue 57  58 
1 my relationship with Mr. Tarrio. 
2 Q And I guess if you had to approximately tell 
3 us about how frequently were you talking with 
4 Mr. Tarrio in this period after December 12th, but 
5 before January 2021? 
6 A Well, I wasn't talking to Mr. Tarrio so much. 
7 I created a relationship with a lady called Amy Harris, 
8 who --so during the scuffles, I managed to --I put my 
9 body between myself and the scuffle and Amy, and she 
10 seemed to be appreciative of that. And so I 
11 communicated a lot with Ms. Harris. Mrs. Harris? 
12 Ms. Harris? Ms. Harris. 
13 Q And did Ms. Harris ever, I guess, talk to you 
14 about coming back to record with Mr. Tarrio again or 
15 with the Proud Boys? 
16 A Indeed. I felt that Ms. Harris had a very 
1 7 strong connection to Enrique, and we exploited that. 
18 And we were considering --when we heard Enrique had 
19 been arrested, we considered not coming down to D.C. 
2 0 because we felt our access would be compromised and we 
21 didn't want to just walk up and down the Mall and like 
22 wait for, you know, a fight with Antifa in the evening. 
2 3 But as one of my colleagues, Tim  59 
1 Hetherington, said, Listen, you don't let anything in 
2 the office, so if you want to go and work this out, you 
3 have to go the extra mile. 
4 We packed up the car and we drove down. And 
5 Amy managed to organize us picking Mr. Tarrio up from 
6 jail on January 5. 
7 Q So backtracking, I don't know if I expressly 
8 asked this, but can you give us some brief background 
9 on Mr. Harris --Ms. Harris, according to what you 
10 understood her to be, her role with the Proud Boys? 
11 Not role, "role" is probably the wrong word, 
12 but her acquaintance with the Proud Boys. 
13 A She had a very close relationship with 
14 Mr. Tarrio. And she also knew --there's a group of 
15 journalists from the summer who had been basically, you 
16 know, attending every protest across the summer, 
1 7 whether it would be Portland or Chad or Louisville or 
18 Kentucky or Bay Ridge for the Back the Blue rally. 
19 And there's a group of probably a dozen 
2 0 journalists that --maybe a bit more, but there's a 
21 small core of journalists that had been on this protest 
22 trail throughout the summer for both conservative 
2 3 rallies and BLM rallies. And that includes Ron Weaver  60 
1 and BG Gutenschwager, BG on the Scene, Scooter, Ron 
2 Weaver, Mel Cole. 
3 They were documenting the protests. And Amy 
4 is a former --she's actually an industrial process 
5 engineer. She actually looks at industrial processes 
6 and tries to make them more efficient. I learned that 
7 subsequent. 
8 But she's also a concert photographer. And 
9 so she --when there was no more concerts because of 
10 the pandemic, she turned her lens to protests. So --
11 and she was part of that group. 
12 There's another lady, Mariney. 
13 And there's a lot of discussions between this 
14 group of what does it mean to be a journalist, and is 
15 the truth --what's the difference between an activist 
16 and a journalist? And can you be objective? And is 
1 7 being objective and fair and balanced just reinforcing 
18 the patriarchy and white supremacy? 
19 That was a big discussion amongst the group. 
2 0 Can you be fair and balanced and not just maintain the 
21 status quo. 
22 Q In this time period I guess between December 
2 3 and the January 5th and 6th rallies, were you just  61 
1 texting with Mr. Tarrio? 
2 A Yes. I mean, I called him a couple of times 
3 and I said I've heard the Roger Stone answer phone 
4 message, but I basically would text with Mr. Tarrio. 
5 Q Were you ever aware of the Proud Boys, did 
6 they ever talk to you, for example, using Signal? 
7 A No, they didn't. I kept my communication on 
8 normal text applications. 
9 Q Were you aware of Proud Boys using Signal to 
10 communicate with each other or with other folks? 
11 A No. But I would have expected people feel 
12 that Signal is a generally secure way of communicating. 
13 I would dispute that. 
14 Q Prior to returning to Washington, D.C., in 
15 January, were you following Mr. Tarrio, Mr. Biggs, or 
16 any other Proud Boys on social media leading up to 
1 7 January 6th? 
18 A Anything --any information I could get about 
19 the Proud Boys, I was consuming and authorizing. 
20 Q And what were your general views of the posts 
21 that they were making related to January 6th? 
22 A I felt they were inflammatory and 
2 3 provocative. And I didn't think it was hyperbole.  62 
1 thought that it was potentially very problematic. 
2 Q And what did you --back I guess in December 
3 of 2020, what were you thinking that they were actually 
4 provoking at the time? 
5 A I don't know. I didn't --I had no idea that 
6 January 6th would unfold the way that it did. So I 
7 thought that we were going to confront BLM in the 
8 evening, and that's why I didn't take any PPE with me 
9 when I met the Proud Boys at the National Mall at 
10 approximately 10:00 a.m. on January 6th. I had 
11 nothing. I had my jacket and my bag which had cameras 
12 in it. I was ready for camera loops, but not for what 
13 happened. 
14 Q And you said you didn't sense it to be 
15 hyperbole. I guess what didn't you sense to be 
16 hyperbole in the posts --
17 A I didn't sense that --I initially thought 
18 their calls for insurrection and civil war and 1776 
19 were --I felt --it just felt --it just felt the 
2 0 language was becoming more and more inflammatory and I 
21 didn't really understand why. 
22 I didn't really--I mean, think that this 
2 3 could be --I just --I didn't know where the end goal  1 of that was. Like, how much can you ratchet it up 
2 before --we would have these discussions about do 
3 words have consequence. 
4 Q I guess going back also to the communication, 
5 and I said Signal, but did you ever hear of Proud Boys 
6 using Telegram at all to communicate? 
7 A All the time. Telegram is their soap box 
8 that they communicate through. 
9 
10 Q 
A So that was known to you at the time? 
Yeah. I followed Enrique's House of 
11 Propaganda. There's a variety of Telegram accounts. 
12 Telegram is a --is not a great place to be for anyone. 
13 It's a sesspool of hate and misinformation and 
14 disinformation, and it's --it's not a good place to 
15 be. 
16 Q Were you tracking Mr. Tarrio and other Proud 
1 7 Boys advertising that Proud Boys would not wear their 
18 traditional black and yellow on January 6? 
19 A I was aware of that before I got there on 
2 0 January 6th. 
21 Q What did you think about that plan, about the 
22 Proud Boys not to wear black and yellow? 
23 A At the time I didn't really put much import 63  64 
1 to it. In retrospect, I may have miscalculated that. 
2 Q I guess --and just putting yourself as best 
3 you can back in your shoes in December 2020, I guess 
4 why didn't it seem as important to you that the Proud 
5 Boys would not wear black and yellow? And I understand 
6 we're Monday-morning quarterbacking at this point, but 
7 do you have any thoughts on why it didn't ring a bell 
8 or ring an alarm in your mind? 
9 A I --it was just --it sounded like --a 
10 little weird. And then --but I got caught up in the 
11 fact that I was picking Enrique up from jail, because 
12 he posted that like early in January, doesn't he? And 
13 I'm picking Enrique up from jail. 
14 We're hearing the call from the President on 
15 the news where he's, you know, trying to cajole Joel 
16 Raffensperger into giving him 11,000 votes. We're 
1 7 seeing the letter by 10 former secretaries of defense 
18 saying, you know --advocating, you know. There's a 
19 lot of noise going on right now. So this was just like 
2 0 another facet to it. 
21 And I'm picking Enrique up from jail, and I'm 
22 trying to interview him and I'm not necessarily 
2 3 concentrating on the subtleties of coming in all black.  65 
1 The implication is clear that they want to appear to be 
2 Antifa. But there was no Antifa there. 
3 Q So you touched on Ms. Harris talking to, 
4 about coming down when Mr. Tarrio --when Mr. Tarrio 
5 was locked up on January 4. I guess what were you 
6 expecting? You made, I think, a quote, and this is 
7 words to the effect of, You're not going to get 
8 anything sitting in the office; right? 
9 So what were you expecting coming to D.C. as 
10 you were driving down? 
11 A Actually, we thought it would be a rally. We 
12 thought that there would be some --we thought it would 
13 be a rally. I thought that they were trying to engage 
14 with BLM and Antifa in the evening. I wasn't even 
15 aware of the legislative schedule as well. Like, I 
16 didn't understand the importance of 1:00 p.m. 
1 7 I knew there was a joint session of Congress. 
18 I knew that they were going to be counting electoral 
19 votes, but I hadn't put that all together with the 
2 0 speech and the --I didn't expect there to be that many 
21 people as well. 
22 We were shocked because we hadn't actually 
2 3 booked a hotel, and the only hotel we would get --we  1 liked staying at the Capitol Hill Hotel because the 
2 parking was easy. And it's not a bad hotel. It was 
3 reasonably priced, and during the pandemic it was a 
4 good value and the breakfast was good. 
5 But we had to stay at a very bizarre sort of 
6 modern hotel called the Citizen M, which we were 
7 disappointed in. That was the only hotel we would get 
8 into that wasn't ridiculously expensive. 
9 So that was like a sign that there was way 
10 more people than we had anticipated being. 
11 Q When you say "we," who came to Washington, 
12 D.C., with you on January? 
13 A Two journalist colleagues who had worked on 
14 previous films, pick up Spiess, S-p-i-e-s-s, and 
15 Nicholas Lupo, L-u-p-o. 
16 Q Thank you. 
1 7 And specific --and this is a specific 
18 question that we have after reading the indictment of 
19 Mr. Enrique Tarrio, but do you recall Mr. Tarrio ever 
2 0 mentioning a document titled The 1776 Returns? 
21 
22 A 
Q No. 
Okay. So what was the plan going to be after 
2 3 picking up Mr. Tarrio from jail? 66  67 
1 A The plan, which evolved, as --I don't know 
2 if it was a plan, but the --there was a --we needed 
3 to pick up Enrique's bags from the property 
4 re-collection center, which is south of the Mall. And 
5 then we were going to pick up Amy's and Enrique's bags 
6 from the Phoenix Hotel, which I was like --which in 
7 retrospect I was like why am I picking Enrique's bags 
8 up from the Phoenix Hotel when he traveled on his own 
9 to D.C. by airplane? Why were his bags in that room? 
10 So I didn't understand that. 
11 Q Did you ever get an explanation of why his 
12 bags were in the Phoenix Hotel, who brought it there? 
13 A No. It occurred to me subsequently. And 
14 then Ms. Harris ceased to communicate with me 
15 subsequent to the Channel 4 news report, which we 
16 strategically placed with Channel 4 because we wanted 
1 7 to be on the record that this would happen, but we 
18 wanted it to sort of, you know, quietly go away. It 
19 was obviously not quietly going away. 
2 0 We thought if we publish this, then --and it 
21 won't be so noisy --I didn't want to publish it 
2 2 with --you know, the optics of the leader of the Proud 
2 3 Boys and the leader of the Oath Keepers meeting in a  68 
1 parking garage the night before January 5 --
2 January 6th, on January 5, the night before 
3 January 6th --there is no good optics to this. 
4 So I felt that if we didn't publish and the 
5 Department of Justice was to find this out 
6 subsequently, I thought it would be very problematic 
7 for us, as I'm a guest in this country and I have a 
8 green card. And I felt that that --and it did prove 
9 to be problematic for me, frankly. 
10 Q Sorry to hear that. 
11 I guess the question now is so can you just 
12 tell us I guess what the scene was like or what you saw 
13 when you arrived. 
14 A Let me walk you through my recollection of 
15 the events of January 5th. 
16 So we pick up Enrique at the D.C. lockup, 
1 7 which is near the Convention Center, I believe. We 
18 drive south to --we interview him in the car and drive 
19 south to pick up his bags. We drive back to the 
2 0 Phoenix. 
21 Outside the Phoenix was a --it was an Oath 
2 2 Keeper and Stewart Rhodes. I introduced myself to 
2 3 Stewart Rhodes. And there's a tour guy. He has  69 
1 kneepads on. He was very tall. He was wearing yellow 
2 ballistic Ray Ban sunglasses when it was dark, which I 
3 was pretty confused by. And we had a brief discussion. 
4 He liked our film Restrepo, and I had a brief 
5 conversation with Stewart. It was reasonably pleasant. 
6 He gave me his phone number. 
7 And then I went to pick up the bags from 
8 upstairs. I come back down, and my colleague who had 
9 stayed with Enrique was like, You got to come over to 
10 this garage. 
11 So we drive over to the garage, and I 
12 remember my colleague Nico was with me. As we turn 
13 left into the parking garage, which is a block and a 
14 half away, he's like a fucking parking garage? You are 
15 fucking kidding me, or words to that effect. Who are 
16 these people? 
1 7 And so we drive down into the parking garage 
18 and we park. We find Enrique. He's meeting with Josh 
19 Macias from Veterans for Trump, Bianca Gracias from 
2 0 Latinas for Trump, and Kellye SoRelle, who is at that 
21 time referred to as general counsel for the Oath 
2 2 Keepers, Stewart Rhodes of the Oath Keepers, this tall 
2 3 security for him.  70 
1 And then there was another couple of people 
2 tangential to the Oath Keepers that seemed to be there, 
3 who I didn't know and haven't seen since. And then 
4 there was another lady and her daughter that were there 
5 to support Enrique. 
6 Q So we're going to break down each of those 
7 events, and thank you for providing an overview of the 
8 day for us. We're going to break down each piece of 
9 it. 
10 Let's start with the pick up and when you do 
11 an interview of Mr. Tarrio in the back of the car. So 
12 I believe this is going to be Exhibit 4. Which is a 
13 Sony clip of the last four digits of 0008. And this is 
14 a document --or a footage that you provided to us, 
15 Mr. Quested. So we thank you for that. 
16 So let's go to the 5:00 mark once it loads, 
1 7 and we'll just play about a minute or two --or a 
18 minute and a half after the 5:00 mark. 
1 9 (Video played) 
2 0 Can we go to the very 
21 beginning of the video? 
22 And I'm going to ask you some questions and a 
2 3 follow-up. So if we can just play like a minute here.  1 And this is Mr. Tarrio walking out of jail. 
2 (Video played) 
3 Thank you. 
4 BY 
5 Q So just to confirm, this is the video of 
6 Mr. Tarrio's release from jail on January 5. Is that 
7 correct, Mr. Quested? 
8 
9 A 
Q 
10 happening? 
11 A 
12 should think. 
13 Q 
14 Mr. Tarrio? 
15 A Indeed. 
And approximately what time was this 
Middle of the afternoon, like 2:00 or 3:00, I 
Who was the woman that walked up and hugged 
I'm under the impression that that is his 
16 mother, Xena. I'm not quite sure of the name, but I 
1 7 think that's her name. 
18 Q And who was the woman taking the pictures of 
19 him as he was walking around? 
20 
21 A 
Q That's Ms. Harris. 
Were there any other individuals, such as 
22 Proud Boys, for example, that were in the area at this 
2 3 time to greet Mr. Tarrio when he was released? 71  1 A 
2 Long Island. 
3 
4 Q 
A Yeah. There's Kenny Lizardo. Kenny from 
Were there any other Proud Boys? 
Yeah. The one guy with the braids, but I 
5 don't know who he was. 
6 Q Okay. So at the 5:00 mark, the first clip we 
7 played, it was tough to hear in the room we're in right 
8 now, but there's a quote --first of all, do you 
9 remember Mr. Tarrio talking to his sister when he got 
10 in the car on the phone? 
11 
12 A 
Q Yes. 
So there's a quote in that video, and it 
13 probably wasn't clear here in the room today, but he 
14 instructs what appeared to be his sister to sign out 
15 all devices. 
16 Do you recall him making that comment? 
17 A No. I'm driving so --and obviously I was 
18 texting at the same time. So I had my hands full, so 
19 to speak. 
20 
21 Q 
A Who was actually recording in the car? 
Well, the camera you see there is actually my 
22 camera that's like sitting on the front seat. And then 
2 3 so there would be --there might potentially be another 72  73 
1 angle, because I think that Alex got in the car with 
2 us, because we do an interview as we drive away. 
3 Q So it's safe to say --and this is just to 
4 make sure we're clear --that because you were driving 
5 and it appears trying to pull up directions and stuff, 
6 you weren't able to really hear what Mr. Tarrio was 
7 saying at the time he was in the car? 
8 A Yeah, there's only so much information I can 
9 process. 
10 Q It also appears, just from watching the 
11 video, that Mr. Tarrio may be using Amy Harris's phone. 
12 Does that seem reasonable to you at this time if he's 
13 on the phone? 
14 A I wouldn't know where else he would have got 
15 the phone from. 
16 Q Do you recall --and, again, if you don't, 
1 7 it's perfectly fair. 
18 But do you recall any topics in general that 
19 Mr. Tarrio had been talking on the phone about in the 
2 0 afternoon on January 5? 
21 A No. He was just talking about --I remember 
22 he talked about his experience over the last, you know, 
2 3 24 hours or so.  1 Q So he was talking mostly about the arrest and 
2 then his time in the D.C. jail? 
3 A Yeah. We interviewed him about his arrest 
4 and the process that, you know, the process that he 
5 went through. And in retrospect, it's like he talks 
6 about --he was very aware that he was followed while 
7 in the airport. 
8 He's like, I went to the bathroom. The guy 
9 followed me --
10 Q I'd just like to stop you real quick. 
12 Congressman Jaime Raskin has joined the interview. 
13 BY 
14 
15 Q 
A Please proceed, Mr. Quested. 
Okay. 
16 So he recounts the story of being in the 
1 7 airport and aware that there was a --someone was 
18 following him, which is --if he was aware that he was 
19 being followed and he had the magazines in his bag and 
2 0 he's entering D.C. with these magazines, then why 
21 didn't he ditch the magazines? 
22 
23 Q 
A I guess to bring us full circle --
1 know I can't ask you that question. It's 74  1 just a rhetorical question that we were asking 
2 ourselves subsequent to the fact. 
3 Q And I think you are asking --and correct me 
4 if I'm wrong. You were asking this rhetorical question 
5 because, as you talked about earlier, it was your 
6 belief that the Proud Boys were generally aware of the 
7 laws regarding firearms, ammunition, and body armor? 
8 
9 A 
Q Yes. 
And so for Mr. Tarrio to get arrested for the 
10 magazines heading into Washington, D.C., did that 
11 strike you as odd? 
12 
13 A 
Q 
14 as odd? 
15 A In retrospect, absolutely. 
At the time, though, did it really strike you 
No. It took some --it took some analysis of 
16 his movements to say, well, if he was aware of this 
1 7 then, then why didn't he react to this? 
18 
19 Q 
A Got you. 
And also, you know, subsequent --oh, we 
2 0 didn't mention the burning the flag on the 12th of 
21 December. 
22 Q Please. Can we go back to December 12th 
2 3 then. 75  76 
1 Can you walk us through the burning of the 
2 Black Lives Matter flag, if that's what you're 
3 referencing. 
4 A Yeah. So it was outside the Harrington 
5 Hotel. And a couple of Proud Boys had brought this 
6 banner back, and they brought it back, you know, very 
7 triumphantly to this --you know, this massive, you 
8 know, cheer from the Proud Boys. But they, you know --
9 it implied that they had taken this from BLM violently, 
10 not stolen it from the front of a church. 
11 And they laid it on the ground, and someone 
12 found some lighter fluid and several Proud Boys burnt 
13 it while Enrique watches. 
14 I was very close to the action. I actually 
15 filmed it. And then there's also many pictures from 
16 Adam Green where you can see me filming it. 
1 7 So I was --another perplexed, why Enrique 
18 would have accepted responsibility for burning the 
19 banner when he obviously didn't steal it and didn't 
2 0 burn it. 
21 Q What was the general response to these Proud 
2 2 Boys burning the Black Lives Matter flag on 
2 3 December 12th?  1 A They --it felt like victory, like we had 
2 done something tangible and this was a win. 
3 Q And so we can orient us as to time, was this 
4 before Mr. Bertino was stabbed? 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 A 
Q 
A 
Q Yes, absolutely. 
Okay. 
Maybe 20 minutes before. Maybe half an hour. 
BY 
We've talked generally about the Proud Boys' 
10 approach to Antifa and BLM. But what --did you hear 
11 anybody talking about what burning the BLM flag 
12 represented in that moment? 
13 
14 
15 A 
Q 
A No. It was just like, Fuck BLM. 
Did you ever hear anybody or ask anybody --
1 don't think you could --they could never 
16 define what BLM --who BLM are or what Antifa is. They 
1 7 talk about Antifa as this actual organization, whereas 
18 Antifa is not an organization. Antifa is a group of 
19 people that want to resist fascism. There may be 
2 0 groups within Antifa that are actual groups, but as an 
21 actual concept, there is no leader Antifa and there is 
2 2 no structure. 
2 3 But they look at it like it's an organization 77  1 they are fighting. And BLM too. They feel that they 
2 are resisting something that's tangible. 
3 Q How would they determine who is Antifa and 
4 BLM in person? 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 A People that were --I mean, people of color 
and people with progressive values. And I don't think 
there's a middle ground there. I think if you're 
not --if you're not with them, you're with --if 
you're not with them, you're with the terrorists. It's 
very binary. 
So going back to Exhibit 4. 
, do you mind if we play at the 15:00 mark. 
And this is still in the back of your car when 
Mr. Tarrio is released from jail, and this is during 
your interview portion. 
(Video played) 
BY 
Q So here it appears that Mr. Tarrio is 
19 considering staying at a hotel in Arlington, Virginia. 
2 0 But did he actually end up staying at a hotel in 
21 Arlington, Virginia, on January 5? 
22 
23 A 
Q No. The plan changed to head to Baltimore. 
Do you recall why the plan changed to 78  1 Baltimore versus Arlington? 
2 A No. Maybe there was some conversation about 
3 renting a car for Amy, and they would get it from the 
4 airport in Baltimore. I'm not --I can't say that with 
5 any specificity. 
6 Also I'd like to note for the 
7 record that Mr. Raskin is no longer in the deposition. 
8 THE WITNESS. Was it something I said? 
9 BY 
10 Q Do you remember or recall who coordinated 
11 Mr. Tarrio's hotel arrangements to the best of your 
12 recollection? 
13 A I believe Ms. Harris organized the hotel, and 
14 the rental car that they were going to use to drive 
15 back to Miami. 
16 
17 Q I guess being like a journalist, a 
18 documentarian filmmaker, do you have any response to 
19 Ms. Harris booking hotel arrangements and booking a 
2 0 rental car for Mr. Tarrio? 
21 A We thought it was problematic from an ethical 
2 2 perspective, but at this point we felt our access was 
2 3 dependent on Ms. Harris. And so we --you know, we 79  1 didn't feel that our, we had any ethical jeopardy by 
2 continuing to work. 
3 Q So it was safe to say at this time, and 
4 probably throughout December and January, you felt that 
5 Ms. Harris kind of established your relationship to be 
6 able to continue to film Mr. Tarrio? 
7 A Indeed. 
8 , can we play the 
9 17:30 mark of Exhibit 4. 
10 (Video played) 
11 Actually, can we 
12 go a little before there. Let's go to 17:15. Or maybe 
13 17:00, just to be safe. 
14 (Video played) 
15 BY 
16 Q So I wanted you to hear in this clip 
1 7 Ms. Harris says that she got a text from everybody and 
18 she saw that Roger Stone said that Mr. Tarrio would 
19 receive a pardon from former President Trump. 
2 0 Do you recall this part of the conversation 
21 in the back of your car on January 5? 
22 
23 A 
Q No. 
Rewatching it now, what is your reaction to 80  1 hearing that and Ms. Harris' conversation with 
2 Mr. Tarrio? 
3 A I was wondering whether she was part of the 
4 text group, Friends of Roger Stone. 
5 
6 Q 
A I guess why were you wondering that? 
Because Roger Stone communicated extensively 
7 through that Telegam chat, which was an invitation-only 
8 Telegram chat, which I tried to insert myself in at 
9 various times to know that. 
10 Q How did you try to insert yourself into the 
11 Friends of Roger Stone Telegram chat? 
12 A I was trying to get someone to recommend me 
13 to join the chat. 
14 Q And I guess you didn't --you weren't 
15 successful in that? 
16 
17 A 
Q I was not successful. 
How did you know that Ms. Harris --so you 
18 are suspecting that Ms. Harris might have been a member 
19 of that Telegam chat at this time? 
20 
21 A 
Q Yes. 
Do you know what was discussed in the Friends 
22 of Roger Stone Telegram chat, or did you have awareness 
2 3 of what was being discussed at the time? 81  1 A Yeah. There was --I mean, there was a lot 
2 of --I was aware that people were communicating about, 
3 you know, many aspects of the Stop the Steal movement. 
4 I wasn't specifically aware of planning for January 5th 
5 or 6th on it, but, like, there was a lot of 
6 coordination that went on within that text group. 
7 Q Do you know --and this is --if you don't, 
8 that's fine. 
9 Do you know if anyone that was 
10 specifically --that you're aware of that was part of 
11 this Friends of Roger Stone Telegram chat? And if so, 
12 can you just list them for us? 
13 
14 A 
Q Those are sources. 
Okay. Perfectly fine. I understand. 
15 understand that from you journalism. 
16 Actually did Mr. Tarrio talk about this 
1 7 possible pardon after the fact? 
18 A No, I don't remember that. 
2 0 already, and we can play the next clip starting at 
21 approximately 22 minutes. 
2 2 (Video played) 
23 BY 82  1 Q So to talk about this clip a little bit. Is 
2 this the same Mr. Bertino you were talking about 
3 earlier? 
4 A Indeed. His nom de guerre would be "Noble 
5 Beard." 
6 Q And you earlier --I think you opined that 
7 you consider Mr. Bertino as one of the leaders within 
8 the Proud Boy organization? 
9 
10 A 
Q Yes. 
Also I'd like to know --it looks like in 
11 this clip Ms. Amy Harris calls Mr. Bertino from her 
12 phone; is that correct? 
13 A Yes. Enrique at this point did not have a 
14 phone and was very concerned about his ability to 
15 communicate. 
16 Q Got it. 
1 7 So there was another woman in this video with 
18 a red jacket on. Do you know who she is? 
19 
20 A 
Q No. 
Also in this clip Ms. Harris says that she 
21 was with Rufio, in quotes, last night, which we presume 
22 is January 4th, and that Nick called. She says this in 
2 3 the same sentence. Ms. Harris said that everyone is 83  1 staying inside right now. 
2 Is "Rufio" a reference to Mr. Ethan Nordean? 
3 
4 A 
Q Indeed. 
Okay. Do you know if "Nick" is a reference 
5 to Mr. Nicholas Ochs? 
6 
7 A 
Q No. It might be Mr. Nicholas Fuentes too. 
Were you aware of the Proud Boys or 
8 Ms. Harris having conversations with Mr. Fuentes at the 
9 time? 
10 A No. But Mr. Fuentes is a close associate of 
11 Mr. Owen Shroyer and they demonstrated a --you know, 
12 on December 12th you saw --on the 11th you saw 
13 Mr. Shroyer and Mr. Tarrio in close proximity. 
14 I'm not aware of --the Groypers and the 
15 Proud Boys seem to be parallel but with different 
16 philosophies. It didn't feel like they were --they 
1 7 felt parallel but not the same. There's a difference 
18 between the two groups. 
19 BY 
20 Q Did you ever hear the Proud Boys talking 
21 about Nick Fuentes and the Groypers? 
22 
23 A 
Q Yes. 
What were they saying? 84  1 A They were --I'd have to say I don't recall. 
2 I just remember them being part of the conversation. 
3 I don't think there was an analysis of their 
4 political differences. It seemed to me they were on 
5 the same --that they were --had the same goal with 
6 different political philosophies. 
7 Q So would you say that the tenor of the 
8 conversation was generally positive or negative or 
9 neutral? 
10 A I think that the tenor of the conversation 
11 was generally positive towards them, but they felt that 
12 the Groypers were overt white supremacists. 
13 
14 Q 
A Got it. 
Which is another irony, seeing as Mr. Fuentes 
15 is of mixed race. 
16 BY 
17 Q Do you know when Ms. Harris arrived in 
18 Washington, D.C.? 
19 
20 
21 A 
Q 
A No. 
Did she talk about --
Actually, I presume that she was there --she 
22 arrived on January 4th or 5th because her bags weren't 
2 3 unpacked when we got to the hotel. 85  1 Does anybody have any 
2 follow-up from anyone? 
3 Can we, , play the 28:00 mark of the 
4 same exhibit, Exhibit 4. 
5 Actually, let's go a little bit --let's do 
6 27:50 then, and just play that 27:00 where you are now. 
7 (Video played) 
8 . Thank you. 
9 BY 
10 Q You just highlight this because in this clip 
11 it also appears that Mr. Tarrio is using Ms. Harris' 
12 phone again in the back of your car. Is that fair? 
13 
14 A 
Q Yes. 
And Ms. Harris, I just want to confirm what 
15 you heard. She said she's the only person with 
16 everyone's phone number after Mr. Tarrio is saying that 
1 7 he wanted to call his mother. 
18 A Yes. Ms. Harris was a --provided many phone 
19 numbers for us within the group. 
20 Q Were you aware of Ms. Harris talking to Proud 
21 Boys as well, other than Mr. Tarrio? 
22 
23 A 
Q Yes. 
If you feel comfortable, do you know which 86  87 
1 Proud Boy she might have talked about? We've seen 
2 Mr. Bertino now. You will recall him. And we've 
3 seen --we presume that she has Mr. Tarrio's phone 
4 number. 
5 Were there any other Proud Boys that you 
6 believe Ms. Harris talked to on her phone? 
7 A Well, Jeremy Bertino, she was trying to 
8 organize an interview with us with Jeremy Bertino 
9 subsequent to our interview with Enrique in Florida for 
10 the Channel 4 piece, but she was upset at the use of 
11 the garage footage in the January --in the Channel 
12 4 piece. 
13 And we had a philosophical argument where she 
14 said, You promised me you wouldn't use it. 
15 And I said, No. I promised I wouldn't use it 
16 out of context, and I didn't. 
1 7 And she is like, That's bullshit. What are 
18 they going to think of me? 
19 Q I guess what was her concern about the garage 
2 0 meeting? I know we're getting into that a little 
21 later. What was her concern? 
22 A I don't know. She didn't --I was like, 
2 3 Listen, I didn't hear any conversations about sedition  1 or January 6th during this meeting. I just think the 
2 optics of this is something that we need to share, 
3 because obviously there was a --you know, one of the 
4 most grave constitutional crises that this country has 
5 ever faced the next day. So don't you think this is 
6 germane to this --don't you think people should know 
7 about this? 
8 And she's like, No. 
9 I'm a journalist. I'm going to publish. 
10 I think this is 
11 the last clip for this video exhibit. Can we play a 
12 little bit before the 29:00 mark. 
13 (Video played) 
14 BY 
15 Q I just wanted to play this video. It sounds 
16 like Ms. Harris is almost pleading --kind of pleading 
1 7 to allow Mr. Tarrio to allow her to drive him home 
18 after January 6th. Is that fair to say? 
19 
20 A 
Q Yes. 
Okay. And it sounds like the woman on the 
21 phone is suggesting that Mr. Tarrio fly home? 
22 
23 A 
Q Yes. 
I guess looking at this video now, what is 88  1 your impression or what are your thoughts of Ms. Harris 
2 pleading Mr. Tarrio to drive him back home to Florida? 
3 A It seems to be more than a 
4 journalistic-subject relationship --journalist-subject 
5 relationship. 
6 Q Are you aware if Ms. Harris actually ending 
7 up driving Mr. Tarrio back to Florida? 
8 
9 A 
Q Yes, she did drive him back to Florida. 
And do you know if Ms. Harris --I think you 
10 said this earlier, but did she arrange for the rental 
11 car to drive him back home to Florida? 
12 A I believe so, but I am not --I don't have 
13 any evidence apart from the anecdotal conversations. 
14 Q And after you all left the jail, you all went 
15 to a building to pick up Mr. Tarrio's belongings, is 
16 that correct? 
17 
18 A 
Q Indeed. 
Is there anything from this clip or from this 
19 interview on the way from the jail to the pickup that 
2 0 we missed that we should have asked about? 
21 A I don't think so. 
22 Thankyou. Thisisagood 
2 3 time for a break, so we'll go off the record at 89  90 
1 12:21 p.m. Eastern Time. 
2 (Recess) 
3 I'm going to pick up, by the 
4 way, Nick, with I believe it is the --it will be a 
5 video at the pickup just to get you oriented. 
6 We will go back on the record at 1:12 p.m. 
7 Eastern Time. 
8 BY 
9 Q So, Mr. Quested, before we went on a brief 
10 recess, we were discussing that you all are on the way 
11 to pick up Mr. Tarrio's belongings after he got out of 
12 jail on January 5. So do you remember approximately 
13 what time you all arrived at the pickup? And I know 
14 this is probably a tough question, but just 
15 approximately when you arrived at the pickup. 
16 A For his belongings at the --it would be just 
1 7 before twilight, so that would probably be around 5:00. 
18 Q And anything stand out to you about when you 
19 all arrived at the pickup building or anything stick 
2 0 out to you? 
21 A Yeah, that they didn't return his cell phone, 
22 iWatch or computer. 
23 Q Did Mr. Tarrio have a response to not having  1 his electronic devices returned back to him? 
2 
3 A 
Q 
4 remember? 
5 
6 A 
Q He expressed a degree of frustration. 
What was he frustrated about, if you 
That he wasn't getting his phone back. 
Was he worried about any particular messages 
7 or phone calls he was expecting, or just in general not 
8 happy about it? 
9 A No. He expressed no concern about his phone 
10 being subject to search because he had two-step 
11 encryption. But then I remember him in the car using a 
12 phone to access his service and typing in the password, 
13 and I think the password was either-or-
14 Q Was this later on in the evening when you saw 
15 him type in his password? 
16 A I don't remember. I just remember him typing 
1 7 it in, and him saying that. 
18 Can we show Mr. Quested 
19 Exhibit 5, which would be Sony clip, last three numbers 
2 0 -026. And I believe this is a video that either you or 
21 someone on your crew took, Mr. Quested. And is in the 
22 pickup building where you're picking up Mr. Tarrio's 
2 3 belongings. It will be Exhibit 5. 91  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 Q Can we play at the 1:00 minute mark? 
(Video played) 
. Thank you. 
BY 
What stood out to you? We just watched about 
6 36 seconds of the video, from the 1:00 mark to the 1:36 
7 mark, but what stands out to you about that video, if 
8 anything? 
9 A That Amy was allowing Enrique to use her 
10 phone. 
11 Q And did you hear Mr. Tarrio say that he can 
12 sign into his "thing" on her phone? 
13 
14 A 
Q Yes. 
And so, again, you took from this video 
15 another example of it appears Mr. Tarrio using Ms. Amy 
16 Harris' phone on the afternoon of January 5th? 
17 
18 A 
Q Indeed. 
And I don't know if you know this, but do you 
19 know what Mr. Tarrio was signing into on her phone? 
20 
21 
22 
23 A I don't know. 
Okay and 
do you have any follow-up on that? 
BY 92  93 
1 Q After leaving this pickup building where 
2 Mr. Tarrio picked up his belongings, where did you all 
3 go; do you remember? 
4 A We went back to the Phoenix Hotel to pick up 
5 potentially more of Enrique's bags and Amy's bags. 
6 Q Did you receive any phone calls of note or 
7 anything like that on the way from the pickup to the 
8 hotel to pick up Ms. Harris' and Mr. Tarrio's bags? 
9 A I don't recall, but I believe you can prod my 
10 memory for a second. 
11 Q Also, I think that anything --I guess when 
12 you arrived at the hotel, did you actually go straight 
13 and pick up the bags at that point? 
14 A No, there was a bit of confusion because when 
15 Enrique walked in the lobby, the manager said that he 
16 was going to call the cops. So Enrique left the hotel. 
1 7 And then we went to get the bags --I went to 
18 park the car, and I got --I can't remember whether I 
19 went to get the bags and then park the car or park the 
2 0 car and then got the bags. But anyway, I went up to 
21 the room to pick up some bags, and I remember making a 
22 bad joke about, Oh, I guess I'm crossing the line here. 
2 3 And then we came back down. And then --and  1 then I remember I went to the car and my colleague, 
2 Nico, came back with us who had been covering the 
3 Freedom Plaza event. He had been covering the speakers 
4 there. And he reminded me that it was a miserable 
5 experience because it was raining and cold. 
6 And we saw Stewart Rhodes and one of his 
7 security guards outside the Phoenix. I remember 
8 walking back and then having to run back to the car to 
9 get the car and drive over to the garage where Enrique 
10 now was, and driving down into this garage. 
11 So we'll play Exhibit --I 
12 think it's 6. It's the Sony clip ending in -031. 
13 We'll just play like the first two minutes or so of 
14 this. 
15 (Video played) 
16 B 
17 Q So this is when you drove back to the hotel? 
18 Is this what you're describing, so when you drove back? 
19 A No. This is Kenny's car and that's my 
2 0 cameraman pick up. I'm separated from him at this 
21 point. 
22 
23 Q 
A Okay. 
And I believe he saw Bianca Gracia hand 94  1 Enrique a phone. 
2 
3 Q 
A 
4 think he did. 
5 Q Yes. 
I don't know if he gave it back to him. 
Okay. You said --you talked about this a 
6 little earlier, but who is Ms. Gracia again? 
7 
8 
9 A 
Q 
A Bianca Gracia is the --is Latinos for Trump. 
Okay. 
And now works for the American Project as the 
10 director of Latin --Latino communications director. 
11 Q Did Mr. Tarrio ever talk about his 
12 relationship with Ms. Gracia? 
13 A No. But subsequently I discovered that 
14 Mr. Tarrio is potentially on the board of all of 
15 Latinos for Trump. 
16 Q Was that also Mr. Josh Macias in the clip we 
1 7 just watched? 
18 A Yes, it's Mr. Josh Macias, who is the --who 
19 is Veterans for Trump. 
20 Q How does he fit in? I guess how does he 
21 know, to the best of your knowledge, Mr. Tarrio? 
22 
23 A 
Q I don't know. 
Okay. 95  1 
2 A 
Q But they seemed very close. 
And at the end of this video, it appears 
3 that's when there's a discussion about going to the 
4 garage around the corner from the hotel. Is that what 
5 this --
6 A Yes. Bianca says that I want you to meet 
7 this lawyer, which I believe is Kellye SoRelle, who is 
8 the --I can't do that. Like inadvertent commas, the 
9 general counsel for the Oath Keepers. 
10 -can we play the 
11 same clip, starting at the 7:00 mark, please. 
12 Actually, we can start right there, at 6:46. 
13 (Video played) 
14 BY 
15 Q So there's a lot in that clip we just 
16 watched. I guess is there --did you see Mr. Stewart 
1 7 Rhodes in the video clip we just watched? Did you 
18 identify him in the background? 
19 A Yeah. That was Mr. Stewart Rhodes from the 
2 0 Oath Keepers. 
21 Q And then Ms. Kellye SoRelle, the general 
2 2 counsel of the Oath Keepers at the time, did you see 
2 3 her in the video? 96  1 
2 A 
Q Yes. 
At approximately the 7:30 mark, Mr. Tarrio 
3 says he's going to stay in Maryland. And earlier we 
4 talked about, in the car, it sounded like Mr. Tarrio 
5 was going to stay in Arlington. So you all ended up 
6 staying in Maryland; correct --or Mr. Tarrio ended up 
7 staying in Maryland; correct? 
8 
9 A 
Q Yes. 
And you don't recall a discussion about why 
10 he went to Maryland? 
11 
12 
13 A 
Q 
A No. 
Okay. 
But I'd like to point out something about 
14 this clip that I just noticed. 
15 
16 Q 
A Please. 
Is that Amy seemed very familiar with Josh 
1 7 Macias, but then later in the evening she says, 
18 That's --that's the first time I met him. That's Josh 
19 Macias, the guy that went to Pennsylvania with the guns 
2 0 and got arrested. 
21 So her action there seems incongruent with 
22 her meeting him for the first time, and it feels 
2 3 potentially that she was --it seems incongruous with 97  98 
1 her subsequent comment. 
2 Q Did you feel at this moment in the garage --
3 take us back. Let's go big picture. 
4 What were you thinking in this moment with 
5 Mr. Tarrio, Mr. Rhodes, Ms. SoRelle in this garage 
6 talking? What were your thoughts at the time? 
7 A We were like --we were quite excited that --
8 it's like this sort of photographic meeting of two, you 
9 know, "militias" in a broader use of the term. And we 
10 were like, Whoa. This is pretty strange and weird and 
11 cool. 
12 We had no context for this at this point. We 
13 were just like, Okay. It's Enrique doing his thing. 
14 But we've always --and my colleague, as you 
15 can see from the clip, questions the wisdom of having a 
16 meeting in an underground garage. 
17 Q Mr. Tarrio mentions also in this clip that he 
18 needs to stay close so he can make sure that his guys 
19 are okay. 
2 0 Does that mean anything? Does that stick out 
21 to you in any type of way? Or why would he --why 
22 would he need to stay close to make sure the guys --1 
23 want you to go back into your mindset on January 5.  99 
1 Were you thinking anything at the time about making 
2 sure his guys were okay? 
3 A Well, I mean, he was --he had his guys 
4 work --we needed guys within a rally the next day. So 
5 we --it didn't seem of that much import at the time. 
6 We just felt that he wanted to make sure that there 
7 were --that if someone was to be arrested that he 
8 might be able to give them some aid. It didn't --
9 obviously, in context now, it has a different meaning, 
10 but then it didn't set off any alarm bells. 
11 Q I guess in retrospect, then, what is your 
12 opinion of that line, that he needs to stay close to 
13 make sure his guys were okay? 
14 A Well, in light of the LOSO group text chat, I 
15 think that means he wanted to continue to communicate 
16 with them throughout the evening and during the next 
1 7 day. 
18 Q And do you have any idea --1 know we'll get 
19 into this later --but why Baltimore versus like a 
2 0 closer county in Maryland to the city? 
21 A Well, there was --it was in a pretty 
2 2 prolific part of the pandemic, so I can understand the 
2 3 reason to be in a city. But, you know, because there  1 wasn't very many services available at the time for --
2 getting food at night was an issue. 
3 So I didn't --but it seemed --again, it 
4 seemed to be counterintuitive. Why would you go north 
5 when you know you're going to be driving south later? 
6 Like, why would you add yourself a couple of hours to 
7 the journey? I didn't understand that. 
8 
9 
10 Q 
A 
Q Also --
And Alexandria is closer than Baltimore. 
Yes, it is. 
11 And another part that stood out is Mr. Tarrio 
12 said that, We have stuff to do on --I have a lot of 
13 stuff to do on January 6th. 
14 Again, this is probably a very similar 
15 question to the one about being close to his guys, but 
16 at the time did you understand that he had a lot of 
1 7 stuff to do on January 6th? 
18 A No. It felt normal, as if he was going to 
19 be, you know, communicating with his --with the Proud 
2 0 Boys during the rally. Just --
21 Q Ms. Gracia talks about authorities reading 
22 Mr. Tarrio's phone messages, or what she thought the 
2 3 authorities reading Mr. Tarrio's phone message. 100  101 
1 Did any part of that exchange stand out to 
2 you when we were watching this footage? 
3 A Well, I watched the footage subsequent, yes. 
4 Obviously it stood out because they were --had some 
5 concern that --she's expressing some concern that 
6 Enrique's communications may have been read by the 
7 authorities. And it also implies that she was on that, 
8 in that group chat. 
9 Q Right. Or at least a group chat with 
10 Mr. Tarrio; correct? 
11 A Yes, indeed. 
12 . _,didyouhaveany 
13 follow-up to that? 
14 Can we play Exhibit --I believe it's 7, 
15 which will be Sony clip ending in -033. And we can 
16 just play this entire 51-second clip. 
1 7 (Video played) 
18 Thank you, 
19 
20 Q So the quote that stood out to me in this 
21 footage is, "It's inevitable. It's going to happen. 
22 We just have to do it as a team." 
2 3 Did that stand out to you at the time, that  1 quote? 
2 A I mean --well, I have to say I --we didn't 
3 record all the conversations that we had with --during 
4 this interaction. And it felt that the Oath Keepers at 
5 this point were --had a very dark philosophy to the --
6 you know, to the political climate in America at this 
7 time. 
8 And it was noticeably different from the 
9 Proud Boys' sort of frat boy drinking club frustration 
10 that these guys seemed more organized and more 
11 determined. 
12 Q Do you know who that man was that was --that 
13 said that line to you in this clip? 
14 A No. But his hash tag from, you know, is 
15 PadsOK. The hash tag --should I explain that? 
16 
17 Q 
A Please. Please do. 
The hash tags were devised by the OSINT 
18 investigators like Sedition Hunters and Capitol 
19 Terrorist Exposers. And they've been used very 
2 0 successfully to identify people on the steps of the 
21 Capitol and people within the Capitol building. 
22 Q And this is research --not even research. 
2 3 This was, I guess, open source hash tags that you saw 102  1 after January 6th? 
2 
3 A 
Q Yes. 
Approximately how long did the garage 
4 interactions with Mr. Tarrio and others last in total? 
5 
6 A 
Q I'd say 20 minutes to half an hour. 
Do you recall hearing the word "Capitol" at 
7 all while you were down there? 
8 A No. I did not hear any discussion of 
9 "Capitol." I did not hear any seditious conversation, 
10 apart from the --the most seditious thing I probably 
11 heard is PadsOK. We're going to have to do it together 
12 as a team. 
13 BY 
14 Q And did you say there were --is PadsOK the 
15 tall individual that you were talking about? 
16 
17 
18 others. 
19 A 
Q 
A Yes. 
Then there were, I think you said, two 
There were two others, but I didn't know if 
2 0 they were Oath Keepers. There was a guy with a 
21 backpack with short hair. And there was one other guy, 
22 but I hadn't seen them around. I mean, I sort of saw 
2 3 them tangentially there, but I hadn't --they weren't 103  104 
1 characters to me. 
2 Q Did you meet them or have a discussion with 
3 them? 
4 A I may have informally shook their hand and 
5 introduced myself, but I had no substantial or 
6 substantive conversations with them. 
7 BY 
8 Q I guess shortly after leaving the garage, 
9 what was the general mood of Mr. Tarrio about that 
10 exchange? 
11 A He was quite upbeat considering that he had 
12 just been in jail and was facing a potential mandatory 
13 sentencing for the --for the magazine charge. He 
14 didn't seem fazed about it at all. He said he was 
15 going to fight it, that this is the struggle that he's 
16 in. 
17 Q Did he have any specific reaction to the fact 
18 that he had just met Mr. Rhodes? 
19 A He did. He talked about how they had their 
2 0 differences and, you know, we have to come together for 
21 this --to fight this together. 
22 Q And I know it's hard to think about this in 
2 3 retrospect -- 105 
1 A He also talked in disparaging terms about 
2 Mr. Rhodes later and called him a hillbilly cowboy 
3 soldier, or words to that effect. I can't remember. 
4 Q So I guess looking back on this in retrospect 
5 it might be difficult, but when Mr. Tarrio at the time 
6 was talking about, you know, there might be some type 
7 of uniting, and I'm assuming this from the Proud Boys 
8 and the Oath Keepers, did that stick out to you at the 
9 time? 
10 A No. It didn't necessarily stick out, but it 
11 just became another sort of block of, you know, block 
12 in the wall of--you know, another building block in 
13 this sort of anti-government sentiment that seemed to 
14 be prevalent in these groups. 
15 Q And did it appear that the Proud Boys and 
16 Oath Keepers, you know, necessarily would have wanted 
1 7 to work with each other, or was this just almost like 
18 an exception to unite based upon what Mr. Tarrio was 
19 saying? 
20 A No. I don't think this was an exception. 
21 think they have different ways of operating, but I 
2 2 think that they were --they had the same goals. 
2 3 So can we play,  1 and thank you again for doing this. This is going to 
2 be Exhibit 8. It should be Sony clip ending in -042. 
3 We can just go straight to about the 2:30 mark. 
4 (Video played) 
5 BY 
6 Q So there's a need to unite despite our 
7 differences kind of answer to your question that you 
8 were just describing? 
9 
10 A 
Q Indeed. 
And where were you all? It sounds like you 
11 were in a car. Where were you heading in this video? 
12 
13 A 
Q We were heading to Baltimore. 
Okay. And this is like during your interview 
14 phase of the ride up to --
15 A I'm trying to interview him at any possible 
16 moment. And Enrique is very loquacious. As soon as 
1 7 the camera is pointed at him, he will start talking. 
18 Q And it seems like he said that Mr. Rhodes had 
19 provided security, he mentioned. Do you know what he's 
2 0 talking about in this video? 
21 A Yeah. I mean, there was --he alludes to the 
22 fact that Stewart was providing security for him to 
2 3 leave the Phoenix in case the police came to --you 106  1 know, to arrest him for violating the restraining order 
2 that the judge issued, saying that he had to leave D.C. 
3 Q Got you. 
4 So that's why Mr. Rhodes and the two other 
5 Oath Keepers were down there, according to Mr. Tarrio? 
6 
7 A 
Q Yes. 
Okay. And Mr. Tarrio mentioned that "My guys 
8 have helped" --and this is in quotes --"My guys have 
9 helped him out in the past," end quotes. 
10 So Mr. Tarrio when he says "My guys," it's a 
11 reference to the Proud Boys? 
12 A Indeed. And it probably is a reference to 
13 the various protests throughout the summer and also 
14 some protests after the election, particularly in 
15 Georgia and, you know, earlier in D.C. 
16 Q And you're referring to protests or events 
1 7 for Proud Boys and Oath Keepers might have been present 
18 at the same time? 
19 
20 A 
Q Yes. 
Do you have any specifics on how the Proud 
21 Boys might have helped the Oath Keepers out in the 
2 2 past? 
23 A No. 107  1 
2 Q 
A Okay. 
But I know that the dispute happened over an 
3 event that happened in Portland. 
4 Q Do you know what the nature of that dispute 
5 was, about the event in Portland? 
6 A No. It was --not really. I think --no, I 
7 don't know. 
8 Q Was it a dispute directed between Mr. Tarrio 
9 and Mr. Rhodes? 
10 A It was a dispute --I think it was a tactical 
11 disagreement about how best to protest in Portland. 
12 Does that trigger any 
13 
14 
15 Q On the way to Baltimore, before you got to 
16 the hotel, did you all make any stops of any nature? 
17 
18 A 
Q No. We went straight to the hotel. 
Straight to the hotel. 
19 Did you all have the occasion to go to any 
2 0 drugstores or anything like that? 
21 A No. I think we went --we stopped at the 
22 hotel and then left to go to the drugstore. 
23 Q What did you all go to a drugstore for? 108  1 
2 A 
Q Enrique wanted to buy a phone. 
Can you just walk us through that, how 
3 Mr. Tarrio came about buying a phone on the night of 
4 January 5th? 
5 A He wanted a phone so he could communicate, 
6 and so he went to a drugstore to buy a phone of --any 
7 description. Well, it needed to be a smart phone of 
8 some description. 
9 Q Got you. 
10 It needed to be a smart phone so he could 
11 download applications of some sort? 
12 
13 A 
Q I presume that's what it appeared to be. 
So Mr. Tarrio's indictment describes that 
14 Mr. Biggs spoke --and by "Biggs," Mr. Joseph Biggs --
15 spoke with Mr. Tarrio on the night of January 5th 
16 before 9:17 p.m. Eastern Time. 
1 7 Do you recall Mr. Tarrio having any 
18 conversations or meetings with Mr. Biggs on the evening 
19 of January 5th in your presence? 
20 
21 phone. 
22 
23 A 
Q 
A No. He would have had to have done that by 
Okay. 
At 9:17 it must be either --we must be in 109  1 Baltimore by that point. 
2 Q Does it seem feasible that Mr. Tarrio would 
3 have went and purchased this burner phone that's 
4 described before 9:17 p.m., given the timing of the 
5 events? 
6 
7 A 
Q Yes. 
Okay. 
8 Okay. At --the indictment also describes 
9 that at 9:20 p.m. Mr. Tarrio was added to the new MOSD 
10 Telegram group chat by Mr. Bertino. 
11 Do you recall any description of this event? 
12 
13 A 
Q No. 
And the document further describes that at 
14 9:36 p.m. Mr. Donahoe added Mr. Tarrio to the new MOSD 
15 members Telegram channel. 
16 Do you recall this happening at all? 
17 A No. 
18 ,lknowyou 
19 followed this closely. Do you have any follow-up with 
2 O that? 
21 BY 
22 Q So you said that you hadn't heard him mention 
2 3 the MOSD chat leading up to the 6th? 110  1 
2 
3 
4 A 
Q Yeah, I had not heard. 
Okay. Then nothing. 
And so it looks like --if you had to give me 
5 an approximate time, or --what time would you say that 
6 you arrived at the hotel in Baltimore? 
7 A 
8 accurate --
9 
10 
11 Q 
A 
Q Can I check my phone? Because it has an 
Please do. Please do. 
So we arrive in Baltimore at 8:00. 
Thank you. 
12 And you're able to --can you just give us --
13 briefly explain how you're able to discern that it was 
14 around 8:00 on January 5th? 
15 A Because I took a video of Kenny's truck that 
16 we were following, and it had a time stamp on it. And 
1 7 it was a nice image of going past --you know, the 
18 classic movie shot of the steam coming out from the 
19 ground? Well, we drove past one of those, so I filmed 
2 0 it. 
21 
22 
23 Q 
A 
Q When you say "Kenny," Mr. Kenny Lizardo? 
Mr. Kenny Lizardo, yes. 
And so Mr. Tarrio would have gone to the 111  1 drugstore after you arrived at 8:00 p.m. on January 5? 
A Yes. 
. Okay. Can we play Exhibit 9, 
It should be a Sony clip ending in -1881. 2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 Let's go to about the 2:00 mark. 
(Video played) 
Q So is this when you all first arrived at the 
9 hotel in Baltimore? 
10 A Yeah, I believe so. Because we would have --
11 because we went in my truck to get his phone. 
12 Q 
13 this clip? 
14 
15 
16 A 
Q 
A 
1 7 Amy's phone. 
18 
19 
20 Q 
A 
Q Okay. So you went to get the phone after 
Yes. 
Okay. 
So that implies that the phone in his hand is 
And --
It had a blue case on it as well. 
Got you. 
21 What hotel? Do you remember what hotel this 
22 is in Baltimore? 
23 A No. 112  1 
2 Q 
A Is it Hotel Monaco? 
I don't remember. It was a shabby art deco 
3 hotel that was quite economical. 
4 Q And that was Mr. Kenny Lizardo that 
5 Mr. Tarrio hugged, also had the white truck? 
6 
7 A 
Q Yes. 
Also in this clip, it appears that Mr. Tarrio 
8 is talking to someone on Ms. Harris' phone about 
9 logging out of something. 
1 0 Did you hear that pa rt of the clip? 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 A Did he say it was logging out of something or 
he was getting locked out of something? 
Can you replay it, just to 
make sure? Thank you, - I think it's at the 
2 --
Q 
A 
Q THE WITNESS. Hotel Monaco. 
(Video played) 
BY 
I think he said "log off all devices." 
Log off, yes. 
Okay. So similar to the conversations we've 
22 heard throughout the day of Mr. Tarrio talking on the 
2 3 phone about logging off of devices, that's a positive 113  1 response by Mr. Quested? 
2 
3 A 
Q Yes, sorry. 
No worries. 
4 Can we go to the 4:50 mark, 
5 approximately. 
6 (Video played) 
7 . Actually, can we go a little 
8 bit before that? So maybe like 4:30.

10 BY 
11 Q So in this clip it appears Mr. Lizardo hands 
12 Mr. Tarrio a phone after saying that it's Rufio. So, 
13 again, that's a reference to Mr. Ethan Nordean? 
14 
15 A 
Q Yes. 
And you heard in this clip Mr. Tarrio said, 
16 "I'm already signed into my old account"? 
17 
18 A 
Q Yes. 
Do you know what they're talking about by 
19 "old account"? It's okay if you don't. 
20 
21 A 
Q No. 
And, again, it appears that Mr. Tarrio is 
22 holding Ms. Harris' phone, still judging by the cover 
2 3 of the phone? 114  1 
2 A 
Q Yes. 
So just to clarify, it's after this video 
3 still that you all go to the drugstore for Mr. Tarrio 
4 to buy a new phone, to buy a burner phone of some sort? 
5 
6 A 
Q Yes. 
Thanks. 
8 that,_ 
9 So we can play Exhibit 10, which is a Sony 
10 clip ending in -1900. Let's just start at like 9:30. 
11 (Video played) 
12 BY 
13 Q So you asked the question, it appears, or one 
14 of your colleagues asked a question about former 
15 President Trump's impact, it appears, on the Proud Boys 
16 or Mr. Tarrio. I guess you've mentioned this, you've 
1 7 touched on it, but what was the former president's 
18 impact or whether --did he inspire the Proud Boys in 
19 your opinion? 
20 A Absolutely. I think he was a central focus 
21 to what brought them together. I think that Trumpism 
22 was the --you know, a binding philosophy for them, 
2 3 that they were there for all things Trump. 115  116 
1 Q And was this --I notice Mr. Tarrio is 
2 talking about it, but would you say that these views 
3 are generally shared by the Proud Boys as a whole? 
4 A I think potentially more stridently by the 
5 lower ranks. 
6 I'd just like to note for the 
7 has joined the 
8 deposition. 
9 BY 
10 Q I guess when Mr. Tarrio said "electrified 
11 everything" in quotes, what did you take that to mean? 
12 What was former President Trump electrifying? 
13 A He was electrifying what they called the 
14 base. 
15 Q And in your opinion, based upon your 
16 interactions with the Proud Boys leading up to 
1 7 January 6th, was it important for former President 
18 Trump to stay in power to them? 
19 A Yeah. They --Enrique talks about if Joe 
2 0 Biden would become president, then he would be in 
21 chains. So I think they regarded this as an 
22 existential struggle. 
23 Q Was this like a topic they talked about  1 pretty frequently when you were around? 
2 A They were not shy about their support of 
3 President Trump. It was front and center that, for 
4 them, Trump was their savior. 
5 . _, can we fast 
6 forward to the 12:20 mark, approximately. 
7 (Video played) 
8 BY 
9 Q So Mr. Tarrio says that they are probably not 
10 a militia. The only drill they ran was how fast they 
11 can drain a bar. 
12 Do you recall --let's fast forward to 
13 January 6th. 
14 So Mr. Tarrio says about a militia. Did that 
15 seem true on January 6th, having been around the Proud 
16 Boys? 
17 
18 A 
Q 
19 about --
20 A On January 5th. 
This is on January 5th. I want you to think 
No. There's four of them, I didn't believe. 
21 They were walking up and down the Mall, obviously doing 
2 2 drills, and they assembled as if they were an organized 
2 3 force. They didn't assemble as a drinking club. They 117  1 didn't stay at a bar. They went and confronted people 
2 of the opposite ideological --political ideology. 
3 That's not what a drinking club goes. A 
4 drinking club goes and drinks until they can't drink 
5 anymore. These guys weren't doing that. 
6 . And then the last clip from 
7 this I want to play is at the 32:30 mark. 
8 (Video played) 
9 BY 
10 Q So it looks like in this clip Ms. Harris 
11 shows Mr. Tarrio a picture of a shirt that says 
12 "Enrique did nothing wrong." It looks like, though, 
13 from this clip that Mr. Tarrio is giving permission for 
14 the Proud Boys to wear this shirt; is that correct? 
15 
16 A 
Q Yes. 
And it looks like this message came through 
1 7 Ms. Amy Harris again. Is that correct as well? 
18 
19 A 
Q Yes. 
In retrospect, do you have any thoughts about 
2 0 these, you know, requests coming in through Ms. Harris 
21 to Mr. Tarrio for him to approve? 
22 A In retrospect, the optics are bad. But I 
2 3 didn't really put much import to it because we're just 118  1 filming the scene. I'm there on a tactical basis. I'm 
2 like, I'm just trying to capture --I'm looking at our 
3 camera work and wincing at some terrible jokes that we 
4 may have coined and thinking about how we could have 
5 done this better. But I didn't have any real reaction 
6 to that at the time. 
7 
8 Q 
A Okay. 
I didn't know that there was going to be an 
9 insurrection the next day. So I didn't really think 
10 about this. 
11 Q So after this interview, approximately when 
12 did you leave Maryland that night? 
13 A We stayed quite --you know, I stay as long 
14 as I can before I overstay my welcome. And so probably 
15 left around 11:30, 12:00 even. I'm not like --I 
16 really --like, I will stay as long as I possibly can, 
1 7 because what am I going to do? Go home and sleep? 
18 I've got to leave with the Proud Boys here. Let's go. 
19 I look at my questioning as well as being --
2 0 I'm still trying to maintain --I'm trying to find this 
21 balance between congeniality and --so I'm probing 
22 without being confrontational. But, like, I'm just --
2 3 I feel I'm not being as incisive as I could be. But 119  120 
1 it's tactical. 
2 I had a whole list of questions prepared, and 
3 I'm trying to poke them through and I'm looking at my 
4 phone and trying to work it out, but, you know, in 
5 certain times I'm like underwhelmed with our 
6 performance as a journalist, but sometimes we do quite 
7 a good job. So when we look at it in micro detail, 
8 it's hard. 
9 Q When you left that evening, did Ms. Harris go 
10 with you? 
11 A No. Ms. Harris stayed with Enrique in the 
12 hotel room. And there's a funny story. 
13 I saw a dog earlier. The dog apparently 
14 stole the pizza that was left over, and then defecated 
15 in the hallway. So that's the sort of hotel we were 
16 in, if you get my drift. 
1 7 And the dog was sweet. It was super cute. 
18 Big pit bull. It was very nice. But I am just saying, 
19 like how many hotels you go that has a pit bull roaming 
2 0 around in it. 
21 Q Is there anything that we missed about the 
22 evening on January 5 that we should have asked about? 
23 A No. I think you've got it all.  2 a brief recess, at 2:05. 
3 (Recess) 
4 . We will go back on the record 
5 at 2:13 p.m. Eastern Time. 
6 BY 
7 Q So, again, just to recap, what time did you 
8 get back to Washington, D.C.? It seems like early 
9 morning of January 6th. Is that correct, Mr. Quested? 
10 
11 
12 
13 Late. 
14 A 
Q 
A 
Q Yes. 
Approximately what time did you get back? 
Around 1:00-ish, I would say. Maybe 1:30. 
Okay. And I guess walk us through once you 
15 slept and woke up how your day started on January 6th. 
16 A We were staying at the Citizen M Hotel, which 
1 7 is on a strange block that has some very complicated 
18 parking regulations. So we woke up, and there's a 
19 Starbucks at the Holiday Inn just a few blocks north. 
2 0 We went and got coffee and egg sandwiches. 
21 I decided to re park the car because of the 
22 parking regulations, which was in retrospect a little 
2 3 silly. We drove around for a bit. And then we managed 121  1 to find an underground parking garage in L'Enfant. We 
2 were walking to the Mall for --ostensibly we knew the 
3 Proud Boys were rallying that morning around the 
4 Washington Monument. We got to the Washington Monument 
5 a little after 10:00 a.m., and the Proud Boys were 
6 literally starting to march down the Mall toward the 
7 Capitol building. 
8 Q Let's backtrack a little bit. 
9 Did Ms. Harris tell you where to be for 
10 January 6th? 
11 
12 A 
Q Indeed, yes. 
When did she tell you? Was it on the night 
13 of the 5th or the morning of January 6th? 
14 A She told us on the night of January 5th that 
15 they were going to muster near the Monument. 
16 
17 Q 
A Okay. And as you were going --
And then she called me in the morning and 
18 said, Hurry up. They're about to leave. 
19 Q So it seems like Ms. Harris was acutely aware 
2 0 of the plans, or at least where the meet-up was for the 
21 morning of January 6th? 
22 A Yeah. And it was if we were --I have to say 
2 3 I feel in retrospect it was as if we were being used to 122  1 record the event in its entirety. And we were a little 
2 late to the Monument, and apparently there was some 
3 scuffles that we missed at the Monument earlier that 
4 day between Proud Boys and some Park Police. 
5 Q Do you recall who the scuffles were with 
6 specifically with the Park Police? 
7 A No, I wasn't there. I missed it, and I was 
8 like ugh. We thought we might have missed the 
9 highlight of the day, frankly. 
10 Q So that's a perfect lead-in, I guess. 
11 So what were your expectations for the day as 
12 you were walking to meet with the Proud Boys? 
13 Sorry, one question on that. 
14 
15 Q What time did you actually arrive to the 
16 Washington Monument? 
17 
18 A 
Q 10:30. 
And the scuffles that you are talking about, 
19 had they just occurred or were they earlier in the 
2 0 morning? 
21 A They occurred around 10:00, I was under the 
22 impression. 
23 BY 123  1 
2 Q 
A So what were you expecting then for the day? 
We were expecting a normal --like marching. 
3 We were expecting to listen to the President's speech. 
4 We were probably expecting to go to some other stages 
5 or rallies. I knew there was one at SCOTUS. 
6 There was a variety of events that day that 
7 we were aware of that we were trying to, you know --we 
8 felt it would be a rerun of sort of what we expected on 
9 December --what happened on December 12th, where there 
10 was rallies in Freedom Plaza. There was a rally at the 
11 Ellipse this time. And that we would go to other ones, 
12 and march around, ostensibly looking for BLM and Antifa 
13 and reinforcing the fact that this was their streets. 
14 Q Do you recall anyone in the Proud Boys 
15 talking about President Trump's speech at the Ellipse 
16 as you all were around each other that morning? 
17 A No. They were walking away from the Ellipse 
18 at this point. 
19 Q They weren't noting, in fact, that the former 
2 0 president would be speaking at the Ellipse. Were they 
21 even tracking that event at all? 
22 
23 A 
Q They did not appear to. 
Do you recall any of the Proud Boys, at least 124  1 in your presence, talking to Mr. Tarrio in the morning 
2 of January 6th? 
3 A I wasn't aware of that. 
4 I'm now in full tactical mode. They're 
5 walking. I'm trying to shoot. It's cold. They are 
6 moving quickly. I'm trying to get ahead of them to get 
7 shots. I'm trying to get inside them to get shots that 
8 other people can't get. Like, I walked in the column 
9 of the Proud Boys. I walked in front of the column 
10 with Proud Boys. I walked to the side. 
11 I'm trying to cover this as a scene now. I'm 
12 totally in the moment at this point. I had no 
13 strategic awareness. I'm like literally just trying to 
14 shoot what I'm seeing. 
15 Q Approximately how many Proud Boys were there 
16 when you arrived at the Monument and started walking 
1 7 across the National Mall? 
18 
19 A 
Q 2-to 300. 
And what was the mood of the Proud Boys as 
2 0 you were around them marching across? 
21 A Okay. So the mood was very different it felt 
22 like on this day. I tend to be gregariously effusive 
2 3 with these people. I'm trying to create commonalities. 125  126 
1 I've got jokes. Even if they're terrible, I don't 
2 really care. I'm just going to make light of the 
3 situation, like this isn't serious. We are all friends 
4 here. Don't worry about the camera, it's all good. 
5 I'm just one of you guys. 
6 And --but it felt much darker. So the 
7 people that had been communicating were cold to me. A 
8 couple were still fine, but they were cold to me. 
9 Like --well, Biggs was still quite friendly toward me. 
10 Nordean was less friendly. But not --as you can see 
11 from the footage, definitely related to me. 
12 And then the Arizona Proud Boys that turned 
13 up with the orange hats or with the orange arm bands, 
14 they were very serious. Like there was no joking with 
15 them. It felt --you know, and being English is, you 
16 know, a little bit --I don't --it's just --it's a --
1 7 to be talking about 1776 as someone from --who is 
18 British is --you know, there's a little bit of an 
19 irony there. 
2 0 And sometimes that could be a barrier, and 
21 sometimes it can be an advantage because I'm not from 
2 2 the country. So --and don't appear to be, so 
2 3 sometimes that's a usual thing. But the Arizona Proud  127 
1 Boys were like just cold. 
2 Q Got you. 
3 . So can we pull up Exhibit 11. 
4 It's going to be a document of Google maps. 
5 BY 
6 Q And this is going to be an exercise, 
7 Mr. Quested, where I kind of want you to kind of go 
8 ahead. I want you to map out kind of how you walked 
9 from the Washington Monument to the Capitol on the 
10 morning of January 6th. And I'm going to do my best to 
11 document this verbally on the record using this map 
12 here. 
13 So you at the Washington Monument. Around 
14 what time do you all start to march? 
15 A We start to march --I got there just around 
16 10:30, and we're heading, from the Washington Monument, 
1 7 east towards the Capitol building. So I pick him up 
18 probably just south of the Smithsonian, and we walked 
19 the entire length of the drive. We make it to the 
2 0 reflection pool. We take a team photo. 
21 They all assembled with the Capitol in the 
2 2 background. We walked to the south of the --
23 Q I'm going to stop you there. Let's go down  1 to page 2 of this exhibit. 
2 So now it looks like you walked across --all 
3 the way across the National Mall; correct? 
4 
5 A 
Q Yes. 
What time do you arrive at the reflecting 
6 pool, approximately? And please feel free to look at 
7 time stamps on your phone. 
8 A Like my first shot there is 10:46, but this 
9 is on my phone so that took awhile for me to get my 
10 phone out. So that makes 10:30 a pretty accurate --
11 then they stopped at 10:57, with the Mall in the 
12 background. 
13 We got the reflecting pool at 11:11. 
14 Q So by 11:11 you made it to the reflecting 
15 pool on the west side of the Capitol, correct? 
16 
17 
18 A 
Q 
A Yes. 
Okay. So where do you go from there? 
We walked to the south of the reflection 
19 pool. And then I'm now set up with my camera trying to 
2 0 get the reflection pool and the Proud Boys walking in 
21 front of the Capitol, but they choose to turn right and 
22 go towards the Capitol instead of back across the 
2 3 reflection pool. Because I was expecting them to turn 128  1 around and come back to go to the speech and they 
2 didn't. They went further up and across --
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Let's use the map. 
First Street. 
So they go --are they heading north on -­
They are heading north on First Street. 
Got you. 
8 So heading north on First Street. And so at 
9 that point the United States Capitol is on the right, 
10 your right-hand side? 
11 A 
12 Monument. 
13 
14 Q 
A Yeah. And we're heading towards the Peace 
Heading towards the Peace Monument? 
I took a photo at 11:52 with the Capitol in 
15 the background with the Proud Boys to my right-hand --
16 to camera right. And there was one police officer at 
1 7 the entrance to the Capitol where the Peace Monument 
18 was. 
19 Q We're going to show some exhibits later, some 
2 0 of these pictures you're referencing. But keep walking 
21 us through. 
2 2 So you head up towards the Peace Circle --
23 A Yeah. Then we walk across --we turn --we 129  1 bear right onto Northwest Drive and walk around 
2 Northwest Drive. We walk past a detachment of riot 
3 police that were preparing. Maybe a dozen of them in a 
4 guardhouse. 
5 We continue on Northwest Drive until we get 
6 to Northeast Drive. We walk around there. We were 
7 looking --then we go to the Capitol Visitors Center, 
8 which is down the steps. 
9 Q So that's on the east side of the Capitol 
10 now; correct? 
11 A Yes. Then we went down the steps. They pick 
12 up Eddie Block in his wheelchair and carry him down the 
13 steps. 
14 Q I am going to stop you there. 
15 When you get to the east side of the 
16 Capitol --first, I have two questions. Do you have a 
1 7 time stamp on your phone when you're walking past the 
18 Peace Circle you just mentioned? Do you know 
19 approximately what time that is? 
20 
21 
22 
23 A 
Q 
A 
Q 11:22. 
11:22. 
Yes. 
And then approximately when do you get to the 130  1 Visitors Center on the east side of the Capitol? 
2 A 
3 at 11:48. 
4 Q 
5 of the Capitol? 
6 
7 A 
Q 11:41. And then we take another team photo 
And that team photo was also on the east side 
Yes, with the Capitol in the background. 
So then where do you go from there when 
8 you're in the Visitors Center and you meet with 
9 Mr. Eddie Block? 
10 A Eddie Block is rolling with us the whole 
11 time, and he's live streaming everything and he's --I 
12 think he's a little --1 have to say I think he's a 
13 little jealous of --of journalists because he kept 
14 trying to, like, roll into my camera. 
15 Q So walk us through, then, where you go from, 
16 on the east side of the Capitol --
17 A So after the east side of the Capitol, we 
18 take the team photo. We walk back over to 
19 Constitution, and we have --there's some food trucks 
2 0 on Constitution. 
21 Q I might have missed it, but how do you get 
2 2 from the east side of the Capitol back to --
23 A We just walked back. We strolled back. 131  1 
2 Q 
A The same route you took over there? 
Yeah. I don't actually recall, but, yeah, I 
3 think we might have. I'm pretty sure we walked down 
4 Northeast Drive and then over to Constitution. 
5 Q Okay. And then approximately what time did 
6 you reach Constitution where the food trucks were? 
7 
8 A 
Q Around 12:10. 
Okay. And then you stayed on Constitution 
9 where the food trucks were at 12:10. So you all made 
10 your way back to the Peace Circle? 
11 
12 A We made our way back to the Peace Circle 
13 around 10 to 1:00. 
14 Q And which route did you walk to get back to 
15 the Peace Circle? Was it down the Mall, or was it down 
16 Constitution? 
17 A No, we walked down --
18 Go to page 1, 
19 Thanks. 
2 O THE WITNESS. Yeah. We walked over to 
21 Pennsylvania and down Pennsylvania, towards the 
22 Capitol. 
23 BY 132  1 Q So you started walking down Pennsylvania 
2 towards the Capitol at approximately 12:50 p.m. Eastern 
3 Time January 6th? 
4 
5 A 
Q Yes. 
Thank you for providing that overview. 
6 And I think --unless you 
7 have any follow-up questions about the map, 
8 Okay. Take that down. 
9 Can we pull up Exhibit 12, which should be a 
10 clip ending in -0049. It's a clip, but it's really 
11 just an image, I believe. 
12 (*Picture shown) 
13 BY 
14 Q Is this one of the images of the Proud Boys 
15 marching that morning of January 6th? 
16 
17 A 
Q Yes. 
And this is what you were just describing as 
18 we were going through kind of like your overview of the 
19 day? 
20 
21 
22 A 
Q 
A Yeah. 
Okay. 
That would be a typical scene of me walking 
2 3 backwards ahead of them. 133  1 Q And, again, just to make sure, can you I.D. 
2 some of the individuals in this photo? 
3 A Yeah. You have --I don't know who the --
4 from left to right, I don't know who the guy is on the 
5 far left. But with the cursor is Zach Rehl on the 
6 phone. Next to him, Joseph Biggs. Ethan Nordean. And 
7 then the guy to the right, he's an Arizona Proud Boy, 
8 allegedly. 
9 Q And we can tell that they're Arizona Proud 
10 Boys because of the orange marking on their sleeves? 
11 
12 A 
Q Or an orange hat that they were wearing. 
Okay. Anyone else of note that we should 
13 recognize in this photo? 
14 
15 A 
Q No. I don't see anyone else. 
And so is it fair to say that the Proud Boys 
16 weren't marching to the Capitol because they were 
1 7 excited or riled up from former President Trump's 
18 speech because they were walking to the Capitol --
19 A 
2 0 speech. 
21 
22 
23 Q 
A They were oblivious to President Trump's 
Okay. 
If you ask me. 
Can we pull up Exhibit 13, I 134  1 believe, 
2 BY 
3 Q And, again, these photos are going to recap 
4 what you just told us basically. 
5 
6 A 
Q Yeah. That's the team photo. 
Okay. So this is one of the team photos 
7 you're taking. Again, we see the Proud Boys with the 
8 orange caps on? 
9 
10 
11 
12 A 
Q 
A 
Q Yeah. 
Those are the Arizona Proud Boys? 
Yeah. 
And then we see Mr. Biggs in the middle with 
13 Mr. Rehl next to him? 
14 
15 A 
Q 
16 the picture? 
17 A 
18 Michael. 
19 Q Yes. 
Who are the individuals on the left side of 
I think the guy on the left side, his name is 
Do you know where he's from or any other 
2 0 connection about him? 
21 A No. There was another --and I always 
2 2 thought, you know, like there was another guy from the 
2 3 12th who isn't here, but he reminded me of him. It was 135  1 kind of like, you know, more --there's some guys that 
2 like to fight. And, you know, it gives them a sense of 
3 purpose and identity. That's what --that guy reminded 
4 me of that guy from December 12th. I don't think it's 
5 the same dude. 
6 Q So on this picture he's smiling, but in your 
7 opinion he was here to fight on January 6th? 
8 A Well, he's dressed like he's going to fight. 
9 He's got a gas mask and a plate carrier and body cam. 
10 I did --I mean, I tried to make --there's a guy with 
11 a baseball bat, as we were walking down the Mall. And 
12 I'm like --1 said to him, I don't know much about 
13 baseball, but don't you need a ball to play? 
14 Which he didn't see the humor in. 
15 Thank you. Can we move on 
16 now to Exhibit 14,_. 
1 7 BY 
18 Q So, again, just another photo. This is 
19 actually on the Mall; correct? 
20 
21 A 
Q That's on the Mall. 
And is it fair to say that Mr. Nordean, 
2 2 Rufio --otherwise known as --was leading chants as 
2 3 they were marching? 136  1 
2 
3 A 
Q 
A Yeah, him and Biggs would lead the chants. 
Do you recall what some of these chants were? 
Yeah. There's a lot of, Where is --Where is 
4 Antifa? Fuck Antifa. 
5 They like to sing a song, Where is my --I've 
6 forgotten how the song goes, but it's a Proud Boys' 
7 song they like to sing. I think they sang it like 
8 walking towards the --across the north --across the 
9 drive there. 
10 They definitely sung it on the 12th a lot. 
11 They scream "Ohuro" a lot, which I think is another 
12 irony. I think it's a Swahili word for "peace." 
13 Q Do you recognize --you see Mr. Nordean on 
14 the left-hand side. Do you recognize any other Proud 
15 Boys in this photo? 
16 A Yeah. Gilbert with the yellow scarf. That's 
1 7 Cressman. Who looks like Gavin Mcinnes. And then 
18 that's Bobby Pickles on the right-hand side. 
19 
20 
21 Q 
A 
Q Right-hand side with the black coat on? 
Yeah. 
And when you said Mr. Cressman, that's the 
2 2 individual sort of in the middle of the photo off to 
2 3 the right with the green vest and the black hat? 137  1 
2 A 
Q Yes, indeed. With the helmet from his waist. 
Perfect. Thank you. 
3 Did you ever hear the Proud Boys doing chants 
4 directed at U.S. Capitol police officers on 
5 January 6th? Do you recall that at all? 
6 
7 
8 A 
Q 
A No. 
Okay. 
Oh, they did --when we walked past the --
9 when we walked past the guys prepping with the riot 
10 gear at --on the Northeast Drive, there was one Proud 
11 Boy that Rick said, Remember your oath. Remember your 
12 oath. Choose a side. Choose a side. Be on the right 
13 side of history. 
14 Q Did this "remember your oath" kind of talk 
15 towards the officer, did that strike you as odd in the 
16 time? 
17 A Yeah, because I thought it was 
18 counterintuitive, that that oath is to protect the --
19 to protect and serve. So if you're being aggressive 
2 0 and walking in a large group of men with --you know, 
21 with an aggressive posture, why would --why would the 
22 police be sympathizing with that. The police are here 
2 3 to maintain order. And they seemed to be obviously 138  1 provoking something that's not orderly. 
2 And you can see Mr. Eddie Block's wheelchair 
3 on the left-hand side of this image as well. 
4 Q Thank you. 
5 Can we pull up now 
6 Exhibit 15. 
7 BY 
8 Q So, again, we're just going to continue 
9 mapping out your day through some of the photos and 
10 images that you provided to us. I think this is a 
11 short video. 
12 
13 
14 
15 A 
Q It's a live photo, I believe. 
(Video played) 
BY 
Okay. So this is when the Proud Boys are 
16 marching past the Peace Circle gate; is that correct? 
17 
18 A 
Q 
19 11:22a.m.? 
20 
21 A 
Q Yes. 
And you said this was approximately at 
Yes. 
And I think you already talked about this, 
22 but you noted there was only one Capitol police officer 
23 guarding the gate at the time? 139  1 
2 A 
Q Yes. 
Do you think that the Proud Boys noticed that 
3 there was only one officer guarding this gate when they 
4 walked by the Peace Circle? 
5 A It's unmistakable. And it's one of the 
6 things that perplexes me most about this day, is that 
7 if you got 2-to 300 Proud Boys marching past the 
8 Capitol in formation, why wouldn't you have as many 
9 police officers as you would have had for the amount 
10 of, you know, on December 12th? Where were the police 
11 this day? 
12 And I'm not asking questions, but who decides 
13 the staffing level, because that feels like an 
14 unnaturally low staffing level, considering there's 
15 going to --they know there's 50,000 people coming to 
16 the Ellipse, and that they reassigned the permit for at 
1 7 least 30,000 people to be there. 
18 Q Were the Proud Boys talking on radio? It 
19 looks like Mr. Rehl might be talking on a cell phone or 
2 0 radio. 
21 A They had Bowson radios that they talked with 
22 extensively. And they used those as well on 
2 3 December 12th. 140  1 Q And they were using it throughout the morning 
2 when you were with them? 
3 
4 
5 radio? 
6 
7 A 
Q 
A 
Q Yes. 
Do you know who they were talking to in the 
No. 
Approximately how many of the Proud Boys were 
8 using this radio? We've seen Mr. Rehl here, but 
9 approximately how many of them were using them? 
10 
11 A 
Q A dozen. 
Were they individually considered leaders, or 
12 was it just everyone kind of using the radios? 
13 A No. It felt like the leaders were using this 
14 to coordinate the various different factions of Proud 
15 Boys. 
16 And technically I know those radios are 
1 7 illegal because they broadcast in a band that you have 
18 to get a license to use. Because I have some similar, 
19 and someone warned that if I was to be arrested with 
2 0 that, then you have to make sure that you're not using 
21 it in that range, when I was in Virginia later. 
22 So I'm sure they would have been aware 
2 3 that --because they have much longer range radios than 141  1 just normal walkie-talkies. They are like five miles. 
2 So they could have been talking to anyone within 
3 five miles, with the possibility of decent reception. 
4 
5 
6 Q I think you mentioned --you said they were 
7 using the radios to coordinate the different factions 
8 of Proud Boys. 
9 Are you talking about for the 6th different 
10 factions, or did you notice that on the 12th? 
11 A I noticed they had radios on the 12th. 
12 didn't really notice them using them quite the same way 
13 then. 
14 Q Can you describe a little more about how you 
15 saw them using --or why you think they were 
16 coordinating different factions of Proud Boys? 
17 A They just had them prominently placed on 
18 their person so they were accessible. And when we 
19 were --they would use them when we would make a --
2 0 when we would change direction. Or they would use them 
21 to relate to someone that the staffing levels in front 
22 of the Capitol were paltry. 
2 3 He's not ordering beers, is he? 142  1 Q Do you remember any specific conversations on 
2 the radio or hear anybody use them? 
3 A No. Then I just know roughly when they were 
4 sort of using them, and I don't know what they were 
5 using them for frankly. So that is conjecture. 
6 , can we pull up 
7 Exhibit 17. We'll skip one. 
8 I believe it's 17. We'll see. 
9 BY 
10 Q Okay. So this is, it appears, a photo of the 
11 Proud Boys at the food trucks on Constitution that you 
12 mentioned? 
13 
14 A 
Q 
15 you believe? 
16 
17 A 
Q Uh-huh. 
And this would have been a little after noon, 
Yeah. Just after 12:00. 
Okay. And did all the Proud Boys that you 
18 were walking around the Capitol with or walking down 
19 the Mall with, did they all kind of settle in this area 
2 0 near the food trucks? 
21 
22 A 
Q 
2 3 discussed? Yeah. 
Do you remember anything else being 143  144 
1 A No, because I went to call my lawyer, which 
2 is on the record --
3 Q There's no need to talk about what you called 
4 your lawyer about. 
5 A No, I'm happy to. 
6 There was no substantive conversation. My 
7 conversation was I thought that there was --it looked 
8 like they were looking for a scuffle. And in my 
9 conversation with him was, If there is a scuffle and 
10 I'm arrested, can you make sure that someone comes and 
11 finds me and I don't get, like, stuck at the bottom of 
12 a pile when there's, you know, 4-or 500 people 
13 arrested. 
14 Q And at this point you're still thinking it's 
15 going to be a scuffle between counterprotesters? 
16 A Yes. I was --I mean, they are purporting to 
1 7 us that they were looking for Antifa at this point. 
18 Q And did you see Antifa or Black Lives Matter 
19 as you were marching around that morning? 
20 A No. I saw no members of Antifa or Black 
21 Lives Matter. 
22 Actually, that's--I saw one member who 
2 3 admitted to being Antifa on the steps of the Capitol  1 who was there as an observer. 
2 Q And just to juxtapose that with December 12th 
3 where it sounded like the police were trying to keep 
4 the Proud Boys and counterprotesters separated, that's 
5 not the feeling you got on the morning of January 6th 
6 as you were marching around with the Proud Boys? 
7 
8 A 
Q No. We were like, Where is the police? 
Where is the police and where is the 
9 counterprotesters? 
10 A Yeah. I was like, This is --I was concerned 
11 of the potential for chaos at this point but not the 
12 chaos that unfolded. I thought it would be a different 
13 chaos. I thought it would be --I thought we were 
14 about to see a potential medieval battle on the Mall. 
15 Like, you know, a freeform melee. 
16 . Okay. Can we pull up 
1 7 Exhibit 18, please. 
18 BY 
19 Q Okay. So you said earlier that at around 
2 0 12:50 is when the Proud Boys started walking back 
21 towards the Peace Circle. And it appears this picture 
2 2 was taken once the Proud Boys arrived back at the Peace 
2 3 Circle; is that correct? 145  1 
2 A 
Q Yes. 
And at this time was Mr. Biggs leading chants 
3 with the crowd as it appears to be --
4 A Yeah, he's asking, Where is Antifa, which he 
5 thought was quite funny. 
6 And it was, Whose streets? Our streets. 
7 Those type of chants. 
8 
9 
10 
11 Q 
Q Just continue to walk through the day. 
Can we pull up Exhibit 19. 
Can you describe what picture this is, what 
12 time is it, who is in it? Just help us understand. 
13 A This picture is at --this picture, because I 
14 took it on my cell phone, is at precisely 12:51. And 
15 it's a picture of Mr. Ryan Samsel putting his arms 
16 around Joseph Biggs. 
17 
18 Q 
A Who is Mr. Samsel? 
I don't know who Mr. Samsel is. I've never 
19 seen him before. I've learned of his identity 
2 0 subsequently, which I also thought was particularly 
21 interesting that someone that I hadn't seen before put 
22 his arms around Biggs like they were bestest of buddies 
2 3 and then leaves. 146  147 
1 And this is important. So he leaves. And I 
2 feel a disturbance, the crowd being agitated. You 
3 know, you hear it. You feel it. There was like a 
4 movement. 
5 So I run over at this point and position 
6 myself at the other end of the fence to where 
7 Mr. Samsel positioned himself. And I don't know why I 
8 ran over there. I just felt the crowd was tipping that 
9 way. 
10 And I just --as a journalist I'm trying to 
11 get to that. We're trying to document the conflict, so 
12 you want both sides of it. So I can either be in the 
13 middle of it, but you can't --you end up having your 
14 own perspective of that. So I try to position myself 
15 at the side to see both sides. 
16 But I don't know --I mean, I just felt the 
1 7 crowd, the atmosphere, change. And then obviously it 
18 went downhill from here. 
19 Q So I guess it's probably impossible, I get 
2 0 it, but around what time --and just elaborate a little 
21 more about what you felt in the atmosphere changing. 
22 A Well, I don't know what it was. I just felt 
2 3 that there was a sudden moment where Samsel walks off  148 
1 and then maybe 30 seconds later there's like --there's 
2 like a --it's a noise or a disturbance or whatever it 
3 is. 
4 And I'm like, I'm heading over there. 
5 Like I'm looking for confrontation at this 
6 point as a journalist. I'm looking for this. 
7 I'm like, This is why we're here. We're not 
8 here to just platform Proud Boys, you know, walking 
9 down the Mall saying what they want to say. We're 
10 looking to the point where there's going to be 
11 conflict. 
12 So that's why I'm heading towards it. 
13 All right. So let's move to 
14 the next exhibit, which will be Exhibit 20. And let's 
15 play like the first minute of this. 
1 6 (Video played) 
1 7 Thank you. 
18 B 
19 Q So you noted Mr. Nicolas Pepe in the video. 
2 0 First of all, can you just describe --so 
21 what is this video? I think we know what it is, but 
2 2 what is th is video? 
23 A This is a video I shot on my iPhone at this  1 point. I'm using two cameras, the slow motion camera 
2 and my big camera at the same time. And so this is a 
3 slow-motion shot, shot on my iPhone. 
4 Q And it's a slow motion shot of the initial 
5 breach of the Peace Circle? 
6 
7 A 
Q Yes. 
Can you just --did you see the initial 
8 breach happening? 
9 
10 
11 
12 A 
Q 
A Yes. On the camera. 
Got you. 
Can you just walk us through, though --
So I walk up. I manage to get to the side of 
13 the --it's called the bike racks, the crowd control. 
14 And there's three young ladies, three young Capitol 
15 police officers. And there's a gentleman in a blue and 
16 black checked sort of tartany-type shirt with a green 
1 7 beanie on. And he starts pushing his back against the 
18 bike racks. 
19 And the Capitol police officer says, Stop. 
2 0 And he doesn't respond. And then a guy 
21 behind the screen, (descriptive sound). And then 
22 there's more pushing and the barrier starts to come 
2 3 down and one girl falls over. 149  1 And at this point, though, the crowd told the 
2 police officer to get out of the way. And when the 
3 police officers fell over, they did attempt to help 
4 pick them up. I know on the far side, I could see 
5 Samsel dealing with a police officer who got knocked 
6 over. And the girl in front of us got knocked over and 
7 someone tried to help her up. 
8 And then they're throwing the barriers away, 
9 and they're taking the sort of snow fencing away to 
10 clear the path for everyone to come in. 
11 And then you see the Proud Boys not quite at 
12 the front of this, but just behind. 
13 Q How far behind would you say the Proud Boys 
14 were when this initial breach occurred? 
15 A If they're not the first ten people, they're 
16 the next ten people. 
17 Q And you pointed out a Mr. Nicolas Pepe in 
18 this video. Who is Mr. Pepe? 
19 
20 
21 
22 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
2 3 Proud Boys? He's a Proud Boy. 
Had you seen him before this day? 
Yes. 
Who is he, I guess? Is he a leader in the 150  1 A I don't know. I don't know, but I've seen 
2 him around. 
3 Q And he's one of those Proud Boys that's right 
4 after the first ten that was going through the barrier? 
5 A Yes. If you play this clip further on, 
6 you're going to see William Cressman and his wife or --
7 his wife. And you're going to see a variety. I think 
8 you see Nordean in this clip as well. 
9 Q And you said that when the Capitol police 
10 officer, the woman fell over, there was an attempt to 
11 help them up. 
12 Would you consider this initial breach 
13 violent? 
14 
15 A 
Q 
16 on one hand --
17 A Yeah, absolutely. 
I guess help us understand. Are you saying 
I think this is the rubicon where once 
18 crossed --this is the first time I'd seen violence 
19 used and power used, overwhelming power used against an 
2 0 underequipped, understaffed, and undersized police 
21 force. And it's the first time I had seen that the 
2 2 people were prepared to use physicality to resist the 
2 3 direction of the police. 151  1 Q The police, just to be clear, had directed 
2 these rioters to stop; correct? 
3 
4 
5 
6 A 
Q 
A 
Q Yes. 
And they disregarded that -­
They implored them to stop. 
And the rioters disregarded that message and 
7 still continued forward? 
8 
9 A 
Q Yes. 
Was there anything in your mind that the 
10 officers could have done to stop the rioters from 
11 breaking through the initial breach? 
12 A I think that they were facing an overwhelming 
13 force that was frustrated and angry and determined to 
14 cross that barrier. 
15 Q And I forgot to ask you. How many officers 
16 were at this gate, if you remember, at this fencing? 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 there? 
22 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Eight. 
Okay. 
Maybe, around that. 
But far outnumbered to the rioters that were 
Definitely no more than ten, and more like 
2 3 half with a dozen to eight, I'd say. 152  1 Q And approximately how many rioters were at 
2 the Peace Circle at this time, approximately? 
3 A There's 2-to 300 Proud Boys, but the crowd 
4 is reasonably dense at this point. There are other 
5 people there as well. 
6 Q Did the crowd seem to get excited by the 
7 Proud Boys' rhetoric or their actions after they 
8 arrived at the Peace Circle? 
9 A I don't know. I was --my attention was 
10 directed towards the Proud Boys, so I couldn't speak to 
11 the attitude of the crowd at this point, but they 
12 obviously energized them at this point. 
13 Is there any follow-up to 
14 that? 
15 Pull up Exhibit 21, please. 
16 This is going to be a continuation, now, of 
1 7 the breach. Let's look at the first 30 seconds of this 
18 one. 
19 BY 
20 Q 
21 before? 
22 
23 A 
Q Is this Mr. Cressman that you were mentioning 
Yes. 
What is that that he's holding in his hand? 153  1 
2 A 
Q It looks like an ax handle. 
And are there any other individuals you 
3 recognized in this video? 
4 A Yeah. You can see Mr. Zach Rehl in the 
5 background. And you can see the guy with the war face 
6 tattoo. I don't know. I think he's got a hash tag 
7 too. 
8 Q When you say hash tag, it's hash tag on the 
9 open source community? 
10 A Yes. There's two of them, actually. There's 
11 the guy with the goggles behind, and then to his 
12 left --to our left, him, yeah. Those were both in the 
13 parade as well. 
14 
15 
16 Q 
A 
Q And showing -­
The parade. 
--the individual in the middle of the screen 
1 7 that appears to have some type of camouflage on his 
18 face. And then to his right is a white male with 
19 orange goggles and an orange plating on a camouflage 
2 0 vest? 
21 A Yes. And also you'll notice from Cressman's 
22 plate carrier, it doesn't look full. 
23 Q Correct. And who is Mr. Cressman holding 154  155 
1 hands with; do you know? 
2 A I've subsequently learned that that is his 
3 wife. 
4 Q Okay. 
5 You mentioned that Mr. Cressman is 
6 wearing --or holding an ax handle here. 
7 Did you notice any other weapons? You 
8 mentioned a baseball bat earlier as well, but any other 
9 weapons that Proud Boys might have been carrying on 
10 January 6th? 
11 A They carried --there was a lot of flags like 
12 this, which I didn't really notice it until later, that 
13 that's not a flagpole, that's an ax handle. 
14 BY 
15 Q Mr. Quested, do you know what the flag in the 
16 background is with the blue stripe, green stripe, and 
1 7 red stripe? It looks like a Blue Lives flag, but it 
18 also has green and red on it. 
19 A I thought that there was a subsequent 
2 0 movement of Red Lives Matter as well. I am not --
21 don't know what the green is. Park Rangers Lives 
22 Matter.  1 I'm sensing, by the way, for 
2 the record, that was sarcasm? 
3 THE WITNESS. Sorry, sorry. I'm English. 
4 . Okay. Can we pull up --
5 BY 
6 Q I guess --before we pull up the next 
7 exhibit, so individuals are now running up the walkway 
8 in front of the Peace Circle towards the northwest side 
9 of the Capitol. Is that correct? 
10 
11 A 
Q Uh-huh, yes. 
Walk us through then, do these rioters reach 
12 the west plaza of the Capitol? 
13 A Yeah. They reached the west plaza, and 
14 they're intercepted by a short fence about 2 to 3 feet 
15 high that's --it's not insubstantial. And then 
16 there's a line of police officers on the first steps, 
1 7 the first tier of the Capitol. 
18 And there's a vociferous verbal attack of the 
19 police officers at this point, and the atmosphere has 
2 0 most undoubtedly changed. 
21 
22 Q 
A How has the atmosphere changed? 
"This is our house. You work for us. Do 
2 3 your oath. Let us in." 156  1 Oh, I forgot to mention. It's not on camera. 
2 I heard someone shout, "Let's go get those votes," 
3 between Samsel walking to --walking over to the fence 
4 and me leaving the place where I took the picture. 
5 Q So after we saw the photo of Mr. Biggs and 
6 Mr. Samsel together, as Mr. Samsel is walking over to 
7 the fence you heard a quote of "Let's go get those 
8 votes"? 
9 
10 A 
Q As the crowd is moving. 
Got you. 
11 And this is right before the breach of the 
12 Peace Circle gates? 
13 
14 A 
Q Yes, just --literally just before. 
Okay. So the mood is changing. So now the 
15 chants are being directed about like the Capitol being 
16 their house versus towards Antifa or Black Lives 
1 7 Matter? 
18 
19 A 
Q Yes. 
I just need to know, did you see Antifa or 
2 0 Black Lives Matter in the group of rioters moving 
21 towards the Capitol? 
22 A No. I was very aware of many members of this 
2 3 crowd because we had been marching them down the Mall. 157  158 
1 And I didn't see anyone that would be consistent with 
2 Antifa or BLM in the crowd on the lower plaza. 
3 Q So then once the rioters reached this second 
4 line of fencing and U.S. Capitol police officers as 
5 they advanced towards the northwest side of the 
6 Capitol, what happened then? 
7 A So the police established a line, and I 
8 managed to get the other side of the fence because I 
9 stepped over it. And they asked me politely to get out 
10 of the way. They were very polite, which is unusual 
11 for riot police, to be frank. 
12 And I was --I was concerned at this point 
13 because I felt that the riot police were undersized. I 
14 was standing with big men, and I'm a big dude. And I'm 
15 standing with men that are bigger than me. Lots of 
16 them. And they were angry. And I felt that the police 
1 7 that they sent out were undersized. 
18 And they had riot gear. But I don't want to 
19 be sexist about it, but sending out a woman who is 
2 0 five-foot-eight in riot gear is not going to stop a man 
21 that is 220, six-four. Do you know what I mean? It's 
22 just not going to happen. 
23 Q That's a good point.  1 Were the Capitol police officers, the initial 
2 breach point, wearing riot gear? 
3 A No, they weren't. They were dressed in a 
4 blue windbreaker and a beanie. They had riot police 
5 pretty ready, the first group of maybe 20 that came to 
6 intercept them and create this first line. 
7 Q Okay. So then once the rioters intercepted 
8 the first line as they approached the Capitol, I guess 
9 was there a stand still? Did they push on through? 
10 A The crowd stopped at this point. And then 
11 there was some screaming. And then there was some 
12 kicking of the fence, like of this small fence. And 
13 then people were breaking it up and taking bits of it 
14 to potentially, you know, use at a subsequent point. 
15 
16 
17 Q 
A 
Q 
1 8 type chants? 
19 A Were there chants going on at this point? 
Yeah. It was chaos now. 
Were there chants about "This is our house" 
Yeah. And challenging the police to --for 
2 0 their loyalty to the Constitution. And they would say 
21 how they paid their wages, and you work for us. Let us 
22 through. 
23 Q And was there --what was the Proud Boys' 159  1 role in this, I guess, second wave when you reached the 
2 second gate of officers? 
3 A I don't know. I think --I have to be clear. 
4 I think I saw Nordean kicking down the fence, 
5 but I'm not sure. So --but everyone was kicking down 
6 that fence. And they were pushing the police. They 
7 were --and the police just weren't responding in the 
8 way that I was expecting a police force that was 
9 facing, you know, an angry mob to react. 
10 Q Did the rioters appear to be fearful of the 
11 Capitol police at all? 
12 A Not at all. Not in a --they felt 
13 self-righteous. They felt --I felt that --this is 
14 the first time I felt a religious zeal from the 
15 rioters, was right here. I was like, This is very 
16 different than I had ever felt before. 
17 Q Did you hear any of the rioters mentioning, 
18 you know, the congressional members and the upcoming 
19 vote? 
20 
21 A 
Q Oh, yeah. Absolutely. 
Did you hear them mentioning Vice 
22 President Pence at this time? 
23 A Yeah. There was definitely --they cast some 160  1 aspersions on the Vice President's character and called 
2 him a traitor. And they also wanted to directly 
3 address the Speaker of the House. 
4 Q What do you recall the rioters saying about 
5 Speaker Pelosi? 
6 A That she was a traitor and that justice was 
7 coming. 
8 Q So at this point in your mind you believe 
9 that the rioters were trying to get into the Capitol? 
10 
11 A 
Q Yes. 
And were they saying what they were trying to 
12 get into the Capitol to do? 
13 A Well, they mentioned that they wanted to get 
14 the votes, but I wasn't aware --they just wanted to --
15 there was a force pushing forward. It was like water. 
16 It was going everywhere. There was so many people. 
1 7 They were rapping around the edge. There was people 
18 climbing up on the --on the --with the scaffolding. 
19 There was people running behind the police and getting 
2 0 hit with the batons and getting arrested. I mean, 
21 there was this --there's various ways to this. 
22 And, you know, the police managed to create 
2 3 lines and stuff, but every time the line was broken and 161  162 
1 the crowd is just pushing forward. And the crowd is 
2 getting more and more angry and more and more violent. 
3 Q Approximately how long did the U.S. Capitol 
4 police hold this second line at the northwest corner of 
5 the Capitol? 
6 A I have a --I could check my phone, but at 
7 this point I'm starting to lose temporal and spatial 
8 awareness. I'm now isolated from my guys. I'm on my 
9 own. I'm dealing with a hyperkinetic situation. 
10 I've got the screaming that starts --you 
11 know, there's no flash bangs yet, but you're starting 
12 to see the police taking high positions. And like --
13 and I'm, you know --I've made a variety of films in --
14 you know, in conflict zones. I started to imagine what 
15 really happens here and how people --how the police 
16 would push back. So I'm trying to balance where I 
1 7 position myself, like for my own personal safety. 
18 And I'm not sure of the crowd being on my 
19 side, like, Where is the press in this? 
2 0 There's no --there's a few photographers, 
21 and there's a couple that I know. Wolfgang Schwan was 
22 actually very helpful because I bumped into my friend 
2 3 Wolfgang, and we could operate as a pair and look after  1 each other a little bit because he's also --you 
2 understand, there's a difference between a stills 
3 photographer and a videographer, is that I'm constantly 
4 at my eyepiece and he gets to take his camera up and 
5 down. So if you work back-to-back, he's got much more 
6 spatial awareness than I have. 
7 I'm concentrating --my world is like a bit 
8 through that lens, and his world is like taking 
9 snapshots of what he's experiencing. 
10 So I think that I lose temporal awareness 
11 here. So that's basically it. 
12 So I think that maybe it was like 10 minutes, 
13 15 minutes, and then the line got pushed back. And I 
14 remember walking down the line. I'm always trying to 
15 position myself in that scene between, you know, 
16 rioters, and police, which is tricky. Like, you often, 
1 7 you know, can get caught by both sides at that point. 
18 Q So having looked at your photos and some of 
19 your footage, it seems like you're trying to capture 
2 0 the Capitol police on one side of the fence and the 
21 rioters on the other side of the fence? 
22 
23 A 
Q Yes. 
Okay. And I think I also saw on your 163  164 
1 footage --we can use that as an exhibit, but I'd like 
2 to use it. 
3 Mr. Samsel, again, was at the front of the 
4 line at the new fencing as well. 
5 A I remember him screaming at the policeman 
6 that --questioning his loyalty to the Constitution and 
7 that he was a veteran, and he was in the Marines, and, 
8 you know, this is not --this is --you're on the wrong 
9 side of --and I'm paraphrasing. But you're on the 
10 wrong side of history here. 
11 Q So the rioters eventually broke through the 
12 second line of fencing; correct? 
13 A Yes. They broke through the second line of 
14 fencing. And then they pushed the police back almost 
15 to the wall. Then reinforcements came and pushed 
16 people out to basically the television tower. I used 
1 7 the television tower as --I'm always worried about how 
18 the crowd is going to move, whether there's going to be 
19 a surge, whether I get knocked over and fall on the 
2 0 ground. 
21 And, remember, I had no PPE with me. I had 
2 2 no goggles. I had a stupid old gas mask that doesn't 
2 3 work that was actually more problematic than useful.  165 
1 So I'm --you know, just got cameras. I got no --I 
2 was so ill-prepared I didn't even have money to buy 
3 lunch. 
4 Q And so at this point you just described the 
5 reinforcements coming. The lower west plaza is 
6 starting to fill, already fill with rioters; correct? 
7 A Yes. And then the bike cops come. They got 
8 little cans of mace and they start macing a few people. 
9 They push it back to the steps, but they can't quite 
10 get their line strong because of the television tower. 
11 Then they bring in the flag and trying --there's a 
12 huge Trump rolling banner that they throw on the 
13 police. 
14 And then there's a scream for "Push on the 
15 flags. Push on the flags." 
16 Q So the crowd was actually chanting "Push on 
1 7 the flags"? 
18 A No. Certain people in the crowd were 
19 directing the crowd to push on the flags. And then the 
2 0 line would break, and there would be more rioting and 
21 more pepper spray. And then --it's just sort of a 
2 2 stream of consciousness now. 
23 Q This may be obvious, but what does "Push on  1 the flag" mean? 
2 A So there were these flags, so they used the 
3 flags as a focal point to use literally the weight of 
4 the crowd to push the barriers apart. 
5 Can we pull up Exhibit 23, 
6 please. I believe this is a photo from the lower west 
7 plaza. 
8 BY 
9 
10 
11 Q 
A 
Q 
12 pitchfork? 
13 
14 A 
Q So this is on the lower west plaza, correct? 
Yes. 
And this individual has what appears to be 
Indeed. 
Did this stand out to you, or did you see 
15 other weapons like this in the crowd? 
16 A Yeah. I mean, this stood out for me because 
1 7 of the imagery of a pitchfork and the idea of --
18 doesn't the pitchforks come from the story of 
19 Frankenstein and they came with the pitchforks? 
2 0 I mean, it's just the pitchfork is a metaphor 
21 for weeding out the bad apples or witches. 
22 Frankenstein or witches? 166  1 THE WITNESS. Ogres? 
2 . Shrek. 
3 THE WITNESS. But it comes from before then. 
4 It's like --
5 B 
6 Q But did you view this as symbolism or as an 
7 actual weapon? 
8 A I viewed that one as symbolism. But there 
9 was a lot of people who had sticks and poles and all 
10 sorts of things. 
11 
12 
13 Q 
A 
Q And you noticed -­
Fire extinguishers. 
You mentioned earlier you saw someone with a 
14 baseball bat too; correct? 
15 
16 A 
Q Yes. 
I guess walk us through, then, the rest of 
1 7 your time. Did you ever go past the lower west plaza 
18 of the Capitol? 
19 A I did. 
2 0 So we managed to climb up the scaffolding, 
21 which has hard because --but I got help from the 
2 2 crowd. I got to the right-hand side viewing gallery. 
23 Q So which scaffolding did you go up? Did you 167  1 go up the scaffolding on the north side of the Capitol? 
2 
3 
4 A 
Q 
A No. The south side. 
On the south side. Okay. 
And I was very concerned about going to 
5 the --the upper western plaza because they still had 
6 a --the police would have had a height advantage. And 
7 I didn't see any easy methods for that many people to 
8 exit. So I was worried about the --I still was 
9 concerned about where the National Guard was, where the 
10 real riot control was, whether they were going to come 
11 with dogs and horses and water cannons. I didn't 
12 know --or gas. 
13 And I was like, if they dropped gas on that 
14 crowd at that time and the crowd would surge, because 
15 that's what you're going to do --also they dropped it 
16 here and I got caught in that. 
1 7 And I had my --I got into a fight with 
18 someone who broke my camera. Like, he called me a --
19 the press. And then someone came to my defense and 
2 0 said, The press needs to be here. 
21 But then I went to the western plaza, the 
2 2 upper western plaza with Wolfgang, because I could see 
2 3 the crowd was pushing really hard into that --the 168  1 tunnel entrance in the west. So we saw a guy throwing 
2 a --pushed the flag in and there was guys dropping 
3 down from above and the crowd is cheering. There's 
4 people, you know, literally in rapture at this point. 
5 
6 Q 
A How long did you stay on the west plaza? 
I mean, I never entered the Capitol building. 
7 One of my colleagues did, which you can see from the 
8 film. So we --I stayed there until --you know, until 
9 5:00, 5:30. Then we went around the other side as they 
10 were clearing the northeast plaza. And we got flash 
11 bangs and we walked back down. 
12 Then --and then we went around to the front, 
13 and we saw tear gas being implemented on the upper 
14 plaza and we saw people, you know, coughing and 
15 vomiting over the parapet. 
16 And then we were aware of the curfew and were 
1 7 discussing with the police, Well, how do we leave if 
18 there's a curfew. 
19 And they said, As long as you're going home, 
2 0 the curfew is --you're in compliance with the curfew. 
21 And then we went to --we left there and I 
22 decided to drive north to go and interview Enrique 
23 again. 169  1 Q So you left and went north back to Baltimore 
2 to interview Mr. Tarrio? 
3 
4 A 
Q Yeah. 
Had you heard from Mr. Tarrio at all during 
5 the day of January 6th? 
6 
7 A 
Q No. 
And you hadn't heard anyone really discussing 
8 talking with Mr. Tarrio on January 6th? 
9 
10 A 
Q No. 
So when you got back to the hotel with 
11 Mr. Tarrio, what was his overall mood? 
12 
13 A 
Q Energized but cautious with me. 
Was this different than what he had been 
14 before with you? 
15 A No. He's always been quite personable and 
16 effusive, but he was like, See, I told you. This is 
1 7 what happens. 
18 He has an analogy about a pressure cooker and 
19 when you turn up the heat on a pressure cooker, this is 
2 0 what's going to happen. 
21 Q And he had said that before January 6th and 
22 after January 6th? 
23 A No. I think he said it to me first on 170  171 
1 January 6th. 
2 Q Got it. 
3 Mr. Tarrio also made various public posts on 
4 social media throughout January 6th. 
5 Were you tracking these posts on January 6th? 
6 A No. My phone didn't seem to work until 
7 around about 3:30. And also I wasn't --I was --I was 
8 not concentrating on my phone, except for to use my 
9 phone to capture the event. 
10 I wasn't live streaming this event. 
11 Q I meant to ask this. Did you hear any of the 
12 rioters in the west plaza talking about former 
13 President Trump's tweets or anything that he said 
14 during his speech? 
15 A No. 
16 Okay. 
1 7 Can we play Exhibit 24, please. And we can 
18 go to the 3:00 mark, please. 
19 We're almost done, Mr. Quested. 
2 0 (Video played) 
21 BY 
22 Q What time, approximately, is this video 
2 3 recorded?  1 
2 A 
Q I'd say around 8:00. 
And this is in Baltimore in the same room 
3 from January 5th? 
4 
5 
6 time? 
7 A 
Q 
A Yes. 
And who was in the room with you all at this 
There's Enrique Tarrio, Amy Harris, Gilbert, 
8 a Proud Boy from Miami. There might have been one 
9 other one. And then there's me and my colleagues, Nico 
10 Lupo and pickups. 
11 Q And in the clip we just showed you, 
12 Mr. Tarrio looks at a photo taken by Ms. Harris where 
13 the Proud Boys are marching in line earlier that day on 
14 January 6th; is that correct? 
15 
16 A 
Q Yes. 
Did you hear the part where Ms. Harris said 
1 7 that the Proud Boys did such a good job here today? 
18 
19 A 
Q Yes. 
I guess what was --it seems almost like this 
2 0 was --there was a proud moment there between 
21 Mr. Tarrio and Ms. Harris. 
2 2 Is that a fair depiction of their mood here 
23 in this video? 172  1 
2 A 
Q Yes. 
Do you have any other thoughts after watching 
3 this clip where Mr. Tarrio seemed happy that the Proud 
4 Boys are marching in line on January 6th? 
5 A I think --I thought Amy said --referred to 
6 the Proud Boys as "we." 
7 . Can we replay that again just 
8 to make sure? But I believe you are correct. 
9 (Video played) 
10 BY 
11 Q I'm not sure of the context. It might have 
12 been a discussion, and we can't see who she's referring 
13 to. It's off camera. 
14 Do you know who she's saying "we talked about 
15 this" to? 
16 A No. I thought Gilbert was to the back on the 
1 7 left. 
18 Q Did Mr. Tarrio talk about, you know, the day 
19 at all off camera that might have been different than 
2 0 what he was saying on camera? 
21 A He seemed less cautious when he was off 
22 camera and talking informally. 
23 Q And what was --I guess, what was he talking 173  174 
1 about, words to the effect, what was he talking about 
2 off camera? 
3 A I mean, we talked about this is what happens. 
4 Like, he refused to accept the responsibility for the 
5 hate rhetoric in provoking his voice into violence. 
6 Q Did he acknowledge that January 6th was about 
7 the certification vote? 
8 A I don't know. 
9 Okay. And can we go to the 
10 6:00 mark. We'll just play another clip from the video 
11 and then I'll ask you another --
12 - Hold on a second. 
13 BY-. 
14 Q Before we move on, in the clip --and I can 
15 come back to show you --Tarrio mentions a Terrarium or 
16 a Terrainium. And then right after that Amy mentions 
1 7 an experiment. 
18 Does that mean anything to you? Or do you 
19 want to see that quickly again? 
20 A I know I heard that. But you can play it 
21 again. 
2 2 (Video played) 
23 THE WITNESS. Mike Terrainium. Mike  1 something? 
2 BY 
3 
4 
5 Q 
A 
Q Is that a name? 
I think that's a name. 
Mike Terrainium. And then she mentions an 
6 experiment, I think; correct? 
7 (Video played) 
8 THE WITNESS. She might be talking to me when 
9 I said, "We had that discussion," because we had a 
10 discussion where I was like, Oh, the Proud Boys finally 
11 fucking marched in a line. Excuse me. 
12 The Proud Boys actually marched in a line, 
13 which they had not been able to do until this point. 
14 So that might have been her talking to me, 
15 but "we did it" is not talking to me. That's the --
16 BY 
17 Q Anything about an experiment that they 
18 conducted, some sort of experiment before? 
19 I take that as a no. 
20 A I don't know experiment. Experiments takes 
21 me into a different place. 
22 
23 Q Okay. 
And then you want to go to the 175  1 6:00 mark? 
3 (Video played) 
4 BY 
5 Q What strikes me is no one thought they were 
6 going to get inside, ever get inside. 
7 Do you agree with this comment at the time 
8 that no one thought they were going to get inside the 
9 Capitol? 
10 I guess what are your thoughts on that 
11 statement having been there? 
12 
13 
14 A 
Q 
A In retrospect? 
In the moment you were --
1 think this is a revisionist history of 
15 trying to create a narrative that's an alternative to 
16 reality. 
1 7 Is that definitive enough for you? 
18 Q That is definitive enough. Thank you. 
19 . Do you have any follow-up? 
2 0 Then we'll pull up the last exhibit of the 
21 day, which is Exhibit 25 and it's just more --
22 THE WITNESS. I want to also add something 
2 3 there. 176  177 
1 There is a reason I'm allowed in this hotel 
2 room. And then as a, you know, a journalist and 
3 filmmaker who is quite prolific and gets things 
4 published, there's a reason that I'm there. And he 
5 wants to speak to the camera and create this 
6 alternative reality that he looks like he can plausibly 
7 deny the fact that --in retrospect it's super 
8 disingenuous for someone that has a text chain that is 
9 organizing the infiltration of the Capitol to then go 
10 and be counterintuitive --to then go and try and 
11 create this alternative narrative. 
12 This is a --1 am being used as his alibi. 
13 And this is why we took so long to publish this, is 
14 because I just didn't fit --it was --everything is 
15 too convenient, and on the surface of this, this 
16 one-story, but, as you can see and as this is slowly 
1 7 emerging, this is not just one simple plan. This is a 
18 variety of plans that ended up causing this chaos on 
19 this day. 
20 BY 
21 Q I guess can you help us understand what led 
22 to you going up to Baltimore to interview him? 
23 A I just was like, There's nothing else  178 
1 happening in D.C. What am I going to walk around here? 
2 I can't get any food. You can't --it's 
3 miserably cold. I'm super tired. And it's on the way 
4 home. 
5 So I was like, Let's go to see Enrique. 
6 And, of course, I want his reaction to that 
7 day because I was with his guys all day, and like, what 
8 is --what is --I wanted to know how he felt about 
9 this. 
10 We'll play the last clip, 
11 which is Exhibit 25, which is a clip that ends in 
12 -10168. And we can start at like about the 4:15 mark. 
13 This is just a quick --
14 THE WITNESS. And a Isa, before you play that, 
15 I'd like to point out, though, that even --we filmed a 
16 lot, as you can see. We don't really --we try not to 
1 7 turn our cameras off because you never know what's 
18 going to happen. So it's great if you can control the 
19 narrative and you end up with an edit, but, you know, 
2 0 he doesn't end up with the edit. You get to see all 
21 this. 
22 Right. 
2 3 (Video played)  1 
2 Q So to your point it sounds like in this clip 
3 Mr. Tarrio almost stops the conversation because he's 
4 saying he knows that he has a recorder on him. 
5 Is he referring to your camera at that point? 
6 A Yeah. Remember, this is subsequent to 
7 Gilbert detailing his day and having broken into an 
8 office, and then turning around towards us and saying, 
9 Did you film that? 
10 And we are like shocked because we're a film 
11 crew. That's what we do. We film things. So, you 
12 know, Gilbert is probably, you know --is not media 
13 trained, had no idea what's going on. He's not even 
14 thinking like this. He was caught up in the euphoria, 
15 the moment of having broken into the Capitol and 
16 achieve the goals that they wanted to achievement --
1 7 well, were on the way to achieving the goals they 
18 wanted to achieve. 
19 But Enrique is very well trained in, like, 
2 0 there's a very big difference between him with the 
21 camera on and the camera off. And --but we just leave 
2 2 our cameras rolling. Even if we're not filming, it's 
2 3 like it's on. We turn the lights off and we let them 179  1 roll. 
2 Because we're trying --we're big dudes. We 
3 were trying to be flies on the wall. 
4 Q Right. 
5 At this point it looks like Mr. Tarrio has 
6 his own phone. Does that seem about right, on the 
7 night of January 6th? 
8 A Yeah. Yeah. Well, Amy has her phone, but 
9 there's a bit of intrigue about Amy's phone on 
10 January 6th, is that she said she dropped it at the 
11 Capitol and a Proud Boy brought it back to her. 
12 
13 Q 
A 
14 Baltimore. 
15 
16 Q 
A Brought it back to her where? 
She said she got it when she arrived in 
Okay. 
Which I find --perplexing. Not perplexing, 
1 7 but it just doesn't make sense so much to me. You drop 
18 your phone on the steps of the Capitol and it comes 
19 back to you? 
20 Q Right. 
21 Did you have any follow-up to 
22 that,_? 
23 BY 180  1 Q So after January 6th, did you go home that 
2 night, the night of January 6th? 
3 A Yes, we drove home. I promised my kids I 
4 would take them skiing the next day, and we went to 
5 Hunter Mountain. I got home around 3:00 or 4:00 in the 
6 morning, had a few hours sleep, took the kids skiing. 
7 Q Do you recall Mr. Tarrio talking --did you 
8 see him talking to Mr. Stone on January 6th at all when 
9 you were in the hotel room? 
10 
11 A 
Q No. 
Okay. But you weren't with him throughout 
12 most of the day; is that correct? 
13 
14 A 
Q No, I was not with him. I was on the steps. 
Have you had any contacts with Proud Boys or 
15 Mr. Tarrio since January 6th? 
16 A Yeah. I went to interview Mr. Tarrio again 
1 7 in Miami at the beginning of February. 
18 
19 
2 0 along. 
21 Q 
A 
Q And that was for the Channel 4 --
No. It was for us, and I brought Channel 4 
Okay. At that point when you saw Mr. Tarrio 
22 in February, what was, you know, his feelings about the 
2 3 Proud Boys or their growth or anything like that? 181  1 A He was proud of the efforts that they had 
2 made that day. 
3 Q Did it seem that January 6th had had a 
4 positive impact on the Proud Boys when you talked to 
5 him in February? 
6 If you can't tell us --
7 A No, I can't tell you that. But he was still 
8 trying to justify the behavior of the Proud Boys and 
9 trying to create an alternative narrative where they 
10 weren't responsible for the violence at different 
11 inflection points. 
12 Q After January 6th were you ever interviewed 
13 by the FBI or DOJ? 
14 
15 A 
Q Yeah.

Q

Yeah. 182  1 And then one in the summer. July, I would 
2 say. Yeah, end of July. 
3 Q And you turned over the footage that you had 
4 to the DOJ or FBI? 
5 A I turned over the footage from January 6th. 
6 I called my friend who is a U.S. Attorney and said, I 
7 don't know what I just filmed, but I think that the 
8 right law enforcement agents need to see this. 
9 And he put me in touch with the head of the 
10 Metropolitan Police, the criminal branch, who then 
11 referred me to an FBI agent. I think her name was 
12 Agent Ewing. 
13 And then by Monday the next week I had given 
14 them a copy of everything we saw on January 6th. 
15 Q So did you give the DOJ or FBI the footage on 
16 the evening of January 5th as well?

than they have been. 
- do you have any 
other questions? 
. No, none for me. 
Mr. Quested, in closing I'd 
like to thank you, one, for making the productions that 
you made to the committee very early on of footage that 
we went through here today. And also for taking time 
to meet with us in the fall and now meeting with us on 
the record again. 
As you know, the Select Committee is doing 
our best to try to understand the facts and 
circumstances that led to January 6th, as well as what 
happened on January 6th. And your footage has been 184  185 
1 extremely helpful for us for actually visualizing how 
2 that day went, how the lead up went. So we are very 
3 appreciative of the productions and how forthcoming 
4 you've been with us here today. 
5 With that, we will end and go off the record 
6 at 3:33 p.m. Eastern Time.
