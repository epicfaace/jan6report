subject: Pardons 
Dear Mo 11 i e : 
President Trump asked me to send you this letter. This letter is also pursuant to a request from Matt 
Gaetz. 
It is clear that deep-pocketed and vitriolic Socialist Democrats (with perhaps some liberal Republican 
help) are going to abuse America's judicial system by targeting numerous Republicans with sham charges 
deriving from our recent fight for honest and accurate elections, and speeches related thereto. 
As such, I recommend that President give general (all purpose) pardons to the following groups of people: 
Every Republican who signed the Amicus brief in the Texas lawsuit against other states deriving from 
their violation of Article I, Section 4 (and, perhaps, other) provision of the United States 
Constitution. 
Every Congressman and Senator who voted to reject the electoral college vote submissions of Arizona and 
Pennsylvania. 
American simply cannot permit Socialist Democrats to abuse Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Association, 
United States constitution and various federal statutes via their often-used strategy of abusing the 
judicial process via private organizations they fund or the prosecutorial arm they will soon control. 
Thank you for your consideration. 
Mo Brooks
