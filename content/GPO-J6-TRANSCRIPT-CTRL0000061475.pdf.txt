2 - Good afternoon. This is a transcribed interview of Ms. Jean Lavin 
3 conducted by the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the 
4 United States Capitol pursuant to House Resolution 503. 
5 And at this time, I'd ask the witness to please state your full name and spell your 
6 last name for the record. 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 Ms. Lavin. Jean Marie Lavin, L-a-v-i-n. 
- Thank you very much. 
So this is a staff-led interview. Members might come in and ask questions, 
although I don't see any at this time. Speaking is 
And on the Webex with me today is investigative counsel. 
investigative counsel, and 
12 - investigative counsel. 
13 At this time, could counsel please state your name for the record? 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 Mr. Willson. Is that for me? 
- Yeah. Sorry, Chuck. That's for you. 
Mr. Willson. Okay. Well, there is other lawyers, too, as well. 
- Yeah. 
Mr. Willson. So I'm Charles Willson. I'm from the Federal Defender's Office 
19 here in Connecticut. I represent Ms. Lavin in her case that is pending before 
20 Judge Howell in the District of Columbia. 
21 - Thank you. 
22 So there is an official reporter transcribing the record of this interview. Please 
23 wait until each question is completed before you begin your response, and we will try to 
24 wait until your response is complete before we ask our next question. 
25 The stenographer cannot record nonverbal responses, such as shaking your head, 3  4 
1 so it's important that you answer each question with an audible, verbal response. And, 
2 if I see you, you know, nodding yes or shaking no, I'll just, you know, note it for the record 
3 and have you articulate that. 
4 And, in terms of talking over each other, especially with the virtual, it's very hard 
5 for the stenographers to hear, so we'll do our best to wait for you to finish your answer. 
6 And we do ask that you provide complete answers based on your best 
7 recollection. If the question is not clear, which it might be, please just ask for 
8 clarification. And, if you do not know the answer, please simply say so. 
9 
10 So I want to go through a couple of points here. 
First, it's important that you understand that this interview is voluntary. If at any 
11 time you would like to stop speaking with us, that is your choice. Similarly, if at any 
12 point you need to discuss something with your attorney in private, please just let us 
13 know, and we'll take a break so you can have that conversation with Mr. Willson. 
14 Second, this interview is not under oath. But, because this is a formal 
15 congressional investigation, you are obligated under Federal law to tell the truth, the 
16 same as if you were speaking to the FBI or the Department of Justice. It is unlawful to 
17 deliberately provide false information to Congress. And, for this interview, providing 
18 false information could result in criminal penalties for false statements. 
19 Do you understand, Ms. Lavin? 
20 
21 
22 Ms. Lavin. Yes, sir. 
- Thankyou. 
Third, you are not obligated to keep the fact of this interview and what we discuss 
23 confidential. You are free to tell whomever you wish that you met with us, including the 
24 prosecutor or judge on your case, or you can tell no one at all. It's really entirely up to 
25 you.  5 
1 Fourth, the select committee is separate and independent from the Department 
2 of Justice. We have no involvement with the prosecutions, and the Department of 
3 Justice is not a partner with the select committee in our investigation. 
4 The select committee also is not a party to your criminal case, and is not agreeing 
5 to submit anything on your behalf to the judge on your case, nor can we make any 
6 representation whether, if you tell the judge that you met with us, that the judge will be 
7 more favorable to you during sentencing. 
8 Fifth, we have agreed with Mr. Willson not to share the substance of what you say 
9 with the Department of Justice prior to your sentencing. There are two possible 
10 exceptions to this. If you told us about evidence of a crime that we thought law 
11 enforcement was unaware of, or if we had reason to believe you lied during this 
12 interview, then we would be obligated to tell the Department of Justice or another 
13 appropriate law enforcement agency. 
14 And, if you tell the judge that you met with us, please just understand that they 
15 may --that they might --sorry --that that may prompt questions from the judge about 
16 what you said and whether it is consistent with your prior statements and acceptance of 
17 responsibility. And, if the judge starts asking questions, we may get asked to respond 
18 and divulge what you said. 
19 And, just logistically, if you need a break, whether for comfort or to discuss 
20 something with Mr. Willson, just let us know. We're happy to accommodate. We'll go 
21 off camera and mute so that you can have whatever conversations you need to or do 
22 whatever that you need to do. 
23 And there are several people who might be asking questions. If multiple people 
24 are asking questions at the same time, please just, you know, let us know that you cannot 
25 hear or cannot understand what we're saying, and I'll take the time to repeat the  1 question. And the same goes for if you just don't understand a question that one of us 
2 asks. 
3 Does that all make sense? 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 Ms. Lavin. Yes, sir. 
- Thankyou. 
EXAMINATION 
BY 
Q So we'll just start off with a little bit of your background. Where are you 
9 currently living, Ms. Lavin?

25 Q I am also --I grew up in Connecticut, so Hamden, Connecticut, if you know it. 
And --
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Yes. I know Hamden. 
--how long have you lived there? 
Twenty-six years. 
Great. And what is your educational background? 
GED, no college. 
Okay. Great. And what do you do for a living? 
I'm a lineman with the local telephone company in Connecticut. I'm sorry. 
That's okay. I have dogs, too. 
I think you said lineman, so --
A Yes, sir. Can I let them out, please? 
Q Yes. Yes. Go ahead.  1 
2 
3 
4 Your dogs sound just like my shepherd. 
So have you had other careers besides working with the telephone company? 
A 
Q I was a meat cutter at one time in a supermarket. 
Understood. Thank you. 
5 So we're going to move on and start talking a little bit about --we're going to talk 
6 about two time periods, and first will be from President Trump's election in 2016 up until 
7 the election in November 2020. And then we'll ask some more specific questions 
8 moving forward about the November period until we get to January 6th, and so just to 
9 give you a little frame of reference. 
10 So, throughout President Trump's term, how would you describe your level of 
11 political engagement? 7 
12 A I did attend one rally while he was in office. I didn't campaign for him, but I 
13 fully supported him. 
14 
15 
16 Q 
A 
Q Would you say you paid a lot of attention to politics, or not so much? 
Yes, I do. 
I'm sorry. During the 2016 to 2020 term of President Trump, were you 
17 actively paying attention to politics? 
18 
19 A 
Q [Nonverbal response.] 
Okay. And thinking about that time period, do you remember what 
20 sources of information you relied on? 
21 
22 
23 
24 The Reporter. I'm sorry. I missed the last response. 
- l'msorry. 
BY-
Q Ms. Lavin, did you nod yes to my last question about whether you 
25 were --paid a lot of attention to politics between 2016 and 2020?  1 
2 A I said yes. 
Q Thank you. 8 
3 And what sources of information did you rely on to pay attention to politics during 
4 that time period? 
5 
6 
7 
8 A Television news, internet, Facebook, peers. 
Q Okay. Was that --was that local news? 
A Both local and network. 
Q And on Face book, were you following specific groups, or were you following 
9 news organizations, or both? 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 A Both. 
Q Which news organizations did you pay particular attention to? 
A FOX News, Newsmax, OAN. 
Q Any others that you can remember? 
A No, sir. 
Q Thank you. 
And, in terms of --you mentioned Facebook obviously. Were there other social 
17 media applications that you used? 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 A No, sir. 
Q Okay. So no Parler? 
A For a very brief time. Maybe a month. 
Q Okay. Was that after the 2020 election that you used Parler? 
A Yes. 
Q Okay. Reddit? 
A No. 
Q Telegram?  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 9 
A No. 
Q Twitter? 
A No. 
Q Something called GETTR, G-e-t-t-r? 
A No. 
Q You ever hear of a website called TheDonald.Win? 
A No. 
Q Thank you very much. 
So would you say that Facebook was your primary social media site for news? 
A Yes. 
Q Okay. And do you remember if you followed President --former 
12 President Trump on social media during the lead-up to the 2020 election? 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 A 
Q Somewhat, yes. 
Did you follow --sorry. I just heard a noise. 
Did you follow him also after the 2020 election? 
A Yes. 
Q And that was just on Face book? 
Mr. Willson. - if I could just -­
- Okay. 
Mr. Willson. In terms of following him, do you mean, like, she liked his page and 
21 got feeds, or just would generally see what was out there and, you know, read the 
22 articles? Because follow means something to me that it might not mean to her. 
23 
24 
25 - Okay. 
BY-
Q In terms of follow, did you affirmatively, I guess, like or whatever you have  10 
1 to do to follow President Trump's feed so that his feed specifically showed up, or his posts 
2 showed up in your feed? 
3 
4 A On occasion. 
Q Thank you. 
5 And did you also see friends --sorry --friends posting, like reposting 
6 Donald Trump's social media posts? 
7 
8 
9 A Sometimes, yes. 
Q Well, did you pay particular attention when the former President posted? 
Mr. Willson. During that window of time, the 4 years when he was the 
10 President? 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 - Yeah. We'll start there. 
BY-
Q In the first --
Mr. Willson. Uh-huh. 
BY 
Q The window of time for the first 4 years, did you pay particular attention to 
17 Mr. Trump's posts? 
18 
19 A Yes. 
Q Did you find that you paid more attention to his posts after the 
20 November 2020 election? 
A No more. 21 
22 Q So okay. About the same. Thank you. 
23 And then, in terms of --so that will move --I'm not going to ask about pre-2020 
24 election anymore, so now the time period will be between the 2020 election and 
25 January 6th.  1 So, right after the general election in 2020, did you believe that the election had 
2 been stolen from former President Trump? 
3 
4 A 
Q At that time, I did. 
Do you remember what made --what fed into your belief that the election 
5 had been stolen? 
Things that I saw on TV and on the internet. I did. 11 
6 
7 A 
Q Were there specific people who posted things that made you think that the 
8 election had been stolen? 
9 
10 
11 view? 
12 
13 A 
Q 
A 
Q Not anyone in particular. 
So you don't remember a specific news organization that influenced your 
No. 
Okay. Now, were your friends posting about the election having been 
14 stolen on social media? 
15 
16 A 
Q Not particularly, no. 
So what about those posts, if you can remember, influenced your belief that 
17 the election had been stolen? 
18 A The fact that some of the voting places had shut down at certain times. 
19 There was video of people that were supposed to oversee being removed. There were 
20 no --there was no oversight. There were tubs of ballots that were brought out from 
21 under tables, things that I had heard about ballot harvesting. 
22 Q Okay. So you heard stories that had been circulating about possible bad 
23 behavior on election night, it sounds like? 
24 
25 A 
Q Yes. 
Okay. Thank you.  12 
1 - Now, I think my colleague,_ had a couple of questions, and I 
2 apologize for missing them. So these are --as far as I think, they might be from before 
3 the election. 
4 - Thank you,-. And I'll start at the election and kind of work 
5 my way backwards a little bit, if that's all right. And it's nice to meet you, Ms. Lavin. 
6 
7 Q BY-
So, building on-s prior points about the belief in a stolen election, 
8 I'd be interested in have you expand on that just a little bit more. 
9 So could you explain to us how you thought the election was stolen? You 
10 mentioned polling places being closed specific times. What do you think --what did you 
11 think happened at the time? 
12 
13 A 
Q I don't know for sure, but it seemed very suspect. 
And the things you were reading about, the suspect activities in the election, 
14 was it concentrated in particular geographic areas, this suspicious activity? 
15 
16 
17 
18 A 
Q 
A 
Q It probably did at the time, but I don't remember which -­
Okay. 
--area it was. 
That's very helpful. Just trying to get a fuller understanding of kind of what 
19 motivated folks and how folks were thinking at the time. 
20 So zooming out a little bit more from the election itself, you were talking earlier to 
21 -about your support for President Trump throughout his time in office, and so I 
22 wanted to ask you more generally: Why did you support President Trump? 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A He seemed to be the leader we needed at the time, and -­
Were there particular --oh, go ahead. 
--I believe that he was what we needed.  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 Q And were there particular issues that you thought he was the leader for? 
Mr. Willson. Can I interject a little bit? 
- Sure. 
Mr. Willson. One thing that I think I know that helps. 
Jean, how long have you been pretty much voting Republican? 
Ms. Lavin. My entire life. 
Mr. Willson. Okay. You froze up a little bit there for me, but your entire life, 
8 you've been voting Republican? 
9 
10 Ms. Lavin. Yes. 
Mr. Willson. Just --okay. So all right. That --I think that's an important 
11 factor, but go ahead. 
12 - Of course. 
13 BY-
14 Q Ms. Lavin, I wanted to see if you had any response to that question about 
15 particular issues where you thought President Trump was a strong leader. 
16 
17 
18 
19 A Well, it's the issues that are in the news today --immigration, inflation. 
Q Uh-huh. 
A Without President Trump in office, they've --they've exploded. 
Q Got it. 
20 And were there particular threats that you saw throughout the course of the 
21 Trump presidency that animated your support for the President leading into the 2020 
22 election? 
What exactly do you mean, threats? 13 
23 
24 A 
Q Uh-huh. However you want to understand that. If there were groups or 
25 individuals that you believed were posing a threat to the country that you saw  1 President Trump acting against. 
The riots caused by Black Lives Matter, for one. 
Can you expand on that? 14 
2 
3 
4 A 
Q 
A The violence created by Black Lives Matter, the burning of cities, the beating 
5 of people, the killing of people, innocent business owners. 
6 Q So I take it that you saw many of the protests in summer 2020 as veering 
7 into potentially dangerous territory? That's fair to say? 
8 
9 A 
Q Yes. 
And what's your general view on the Black Lives Matter movement as it 
10 constituted itself in the summer of 2020? 
11 Mr. Willson. Are we getting a little far afield here? I mean, just --I'm just going 
12 to throw that out there. If it's what does Trump think, or what's her understanding of 
13 what Trump thinks about the Black Lives Matter, I can see that being important, but I'm 
14 just wondering --
15 - Sure. 
16 Mr. Willson. --in terms of the list of questions and topics that I was expecting 
17 based on my conversations with people other than yourself, this whole 4 years 
18 from --you know, of Trump before the second election, before January 6th, was not really 
19 discussed as one of the things we're going to discuss today. 
20 
21 - Sure. So--
Mr. Willson. I appreciate the social science that's going on here and trying to, 
22 like, understand why people think what they do, and I think that's important. But, you 
23 know, I'll tell you that Ms. Lavin is a long-time supporter of law enforcement. She is 
24 a --I don't want to put words in her mouth, but I would say she's a Blue Lives Matter 
25 person in terms of, you know, how she views things.  15 
1 And obviously the summer of 2020 --certainly in some cities, there was some 
2 instability. So, you know, what the motivations for that, I guess, is a bigger question, 
3 but --but I guess I'm just trying to stay focused on, you know, January 6th and what got 
4 her there and those sorts of things, because that's the stuff that we're really ready to talk 
5 about more rather than just recounting every political view that she has. 
6 
7 
8 - Sure. So I appreciate that point, and I think that -­
Mr. Willson. Uh-huh. 
- --these questions are meant to lead back into the post-election 
9 period. And obviously there has been quite a lot of conversation about how threats, 
10 whether it be antifa or others, were motivating factors for folks who ended up 
11 participating in the events of January 6th. 
12 Mr. Willson. Uh-huh. 
13 - And so I think having --giving Ms. Lavin an opportunity to give some 
14 background on those worries is important for us in more fully understanding the story of 
15 what happened. And so, I hope that that makes sense. And I'm happy to rephrase the 
16 question to better reflect what she believed the President was saying about --
17 
18 Mr. Willson. Uh-huh. 
- --those organizations and the interaction between those 
19 organizations. But, in terms of events that were sort of in the immediate 6-month 
20 period before the election, that's where our interest lies. And we'll get back to the 
21 events of the 6th quite soon. 
22 Mr. Willson. Okay. I guess --I mean, you could ask her does she tie her 
23 motivation to being there on January 6th back to Black Lives Matter. I think the answer 
24 to that is probably going to be no, but, you know --but, you know, that's sort of what we 
25 were expecting today. So if this is going to be about stuff from July of 2020, then -- 1 
2 
3 - No. 1--
Mr. Willson. --we don't have to do this, right? So --
- I got --we're not trying to --we're not trying to derail the 
4 conversation at all. 
5 
6 Mr. Willson. Uh-huh. 
- I think the point of that question was sort of to give a grounding for 
7 questions we will want to ask about reasons for attending the 6th. And --
8 
9 Mr. Willson. Sure. 
- --if you'd rather save some of those questions for later on in the 16 
10 conversation, that's completely fine, unless-disagrees. But I think we can hold 
11 off on those questions for now, if that makes sense to you. And the reasoning was only 
12 to sort of foreground those questions as they come up. 
13 Mr. Willson. Uh-huh. 
14 - The only thing that I'd want to add --and I apologize, Chuck, if I didn't 
15 make that clear enough when we chatted. And we can go off the record and have this 
16 conversation --
17 
18 
19 
20 hide. Mr. Willson. Uh-huh. 
- --if you'd prefer. So ifwe go off the record at 4:27. 
Mr. Willson. I'm fine being on the record. We don't really have anything to 
21 You know, I --Ms. Lavin will tell you why she went on January 6th, and she's not 
22 going to hide how she came to be there, what her motivation was. She was a Trump 
23 supporter. I mean, you know, whatever we might think about that politically, she 
24 believed --you know, she supported Donald Trump, and she went there to support her 
25 President on January 6th.  1 
2 - Understood. Understood, but --
Mr. Willson. Yeah. So, like --so it's not --I don't know that it's much deeper 
3 than that, frankly, but, you know --
4 - Well, thank you, and I --
5 Mr. Willson. Uh-huh. 
6 - Just to confirm, we are off the record. 
7 But that is your interpretation of what drove Ms. Lavin there, and I think it is fair 
8 to investigate a little bit about what things that happened in the lead-up to the election 
9 might have also influenced her view that she needed to be there to support her 
10 President? 17 
11 They're not completely disconnected as you're saying. And if they are, Ms. Lavin 
12 will tell us. And I think that's, you know, just as far as Mr. Glick is asking. 
13 We're not trying to get --Ms. Lavin, we're not trying to, you know, pry into your 
14 ideological views or debate you about your ideological views. That is not what we're 
15 here to do at all. We're just really here to understand how certain events might have 
16 influenced how you were feeling as the election happened, and then after as the election 
17 happened. 
18 Does that make sense, Mr. Willson? 
19 Mr. Willson. I think it does. It does feel a little prying. I don't think anyone is 
20 debating. You both were being very respectful. I'm probably the one that's difficult, 
21 but in terms of --you know, are we going to review every political angle on this in the 
22 summer of 2020, or are we going to kind of cut to the chase? 
23 So, with that, why don't we try another question. 
24 
25 - Okay. We'll go back on the record. 
[Interruption by the reporter to clarify off-the-record discussion.]  18 
- All right. So now we are back --confirmed back on the record. 1 
2 
3 And, - do you want to have --do you have some follow-up there? 
- No. I think we can return to some of these questions once we get to 
4 the 6th. 
5 So thank you for your indulgence, Mr. Willson. 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 Mr. Willson. Uh-huh. 
- Okay. 
BY-
Q So back to --right --back to right after the 2020 election, Ms. Lavin. 
You mentioned that you came to believe that the election was stolen. Do you 
11 remember when that belief set in? 
12 A Within 2 weeks after the election. 
13 - Okay. Thank you. 
14 In terms of post-election activity, did you participate in any activities, not including 
15 January 6th, related to any alleged voter fraud, such as --
16 
17 Ms. Lavin. No. 
- Okay. Thank you. 
18 So you didn't gather any affidavits for a campaign or for a lawsuit or anything like 
19 that? 
20 Thank you. 
21 Did you donate to any --
22 [Interruption by the reporter.] 
23 
24 Mr. Willson. I'm sorry. 
- So, Ms. Lavin, I asked you if you had participated in gathering any 
25 affidavits with a group, and I believe you said no. Is that correct?  Ms. Lavin. That is correct. 
- Thankyou. 
And sorry about - Chuck. 
Mr. Willson. It sucks. 
- That's not great. 
Mr. Willson. Yeah.

8 Q Ms. Lavin, did you donate to any groups that were making arguments about 
9 election fraud following the 2020 election and before January 6th? 
10 
11 
12 A No. 
Q Thank you very much. 
And then I have one question that I forgot to ask. It's pre-election, so I apologize 
13 again, but it's right before the election. 
14 Were you seeing on social media posts before the election about alleged voter 
15 fraud issues or concerns about election security? 
16 
17 
18 
19 A Prior to the election? 
Q Yeah. So just, like, before the election. 
A No. 
Q Great. Thank you. 
20 So why don't you --we're going to talk a little bit about why you decided to go to 
21 Washington, D.C., for the January 6th rally. 
22 Did anything that President Trump say influence your decision to go to 
23 January 6th --to go to Washington, D.C., on January 6th? 
24 
25 A 
Q No. Nothing he said. 
If it wasn't President Trump, what made you want to be in Washington, D.C.,  20 
1 on January 6th? 
A I wanted to hear my President speak. 
Q All right. So where did you learn that he would be speaking? 
A From the news. 2 
3 
4 
5 Q Okay. And were you hoping that being in Washington, D.C., on January 6th 
6 would do something? 
7 A I'm not sure it would have done anything other than show my support for 
8 my President. 
9 
10 
11 Q And when you say show your support for the President, how --
A By my attendance. 
Q Your attendance, correct. But what part of his Presidency were you trying 
12 to support at that time? Like what --just try to expand on that a little bit. 
13 
14 A 
Q I'm not sure I understand. 
I'm sorry. So you're there to support your President, but in what 
15 way --what about him were you trying to support, I guess I'm asking. Was there a 
16 specific issue that you were there to support the President about? 
17 A I was hoping that the activities that I didn't feel were on the level would 
18 make a difference. 
19 ■■■ I( do you mind if I ask a question? 
20 
21 
22 
23 2020? 
24 
25 11111111111111 No, please do. 
BY 
Q Were you in D.C. or did you come to D.C. to protest the election result in 
A Not to protest. To hear my President speak at his rally. 
Q So you wanted to hear former President Trump speak about the election  21 
1 specifically? 
2 A I didn't care what he spoke about. I wanted to hear him at his rally, like I've 
3 done previous times in different locations. It might have been the last time I heard him 
4 speak, and I wanted to see him. 
5 Q So just to make sure we're clear, you weren't necessarily tracking the fact 
6 that he was speaking about the election result? 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 issues? 
13 
14 
15 A I knew that would be brought up. 
Q And that was of interest of you? 
A Yes. 
Thank you. 
- Where did you learn that he would be speaking about election 
Ms. Lavin. From the news. 
- Great. And I think --
Mr. Willson. Can we take a break for a second? And then, also, if you want to 
16 let the dogs in. I'm not sure if that's something to do. 
17 
18 
19 this. 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 work? Ms. Lavin. Thank you. 
Mr. Willson. But I just want to talk with her for a second off the record, off of 
- Yeah. You want 5 minutes? 
Mr. Willson. Yeah. 
Jean, we're on your phone, right? 
Ms. Lavin. Yes. 
Mr. Willson. So is it okay if she disconnects and then reconnects? Would that  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 - I think that's --that should be fine. Yeah, that's fine. 
Mr. Willson. Okay. All right. 
- We'll go off the record and come back in 5 --
Mr. Willson. And I'm just going to mute myself and step away from mine. 
- Yeah. 
Mr. Willson. Jean, hang up. I'm going to call you. And then we'll have you 
7 sign back in, okay? All right. 
8 
9 
10 
11 [Recess.] 
- We'll go back on the record at 5:10.

Q And I believe we were talking about sort of your motivations for going to 
12 Washington, D.C., on January 6th. I know you had mentioned --you mentioned 
13 something about not everything being level. 
14 What was the everything that you were talking about? 
15 A Say that again. 22 
16 Q You mentioned when I asked you about what you were hoping would come 
17 out of January 6th or going to D.C. on January 6th, you said something to the effect of not 
18 everything being level. And I'm just wondering what the everything was. 
19 A The inconsistencies with the voting procedures and what I saw on the news 
20 that had happened. 
21 Q Okay. So you were specifically referencing the same alleged voter fraud 
22 issues that you had seen. 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q Yeah. 
Thank you. 
In terms of information about January 6th, you mentioned hearing about it on the  1 news. Were you talking to friends about it on social media? 
2 
3 A 
Q Yes. 
Okay. Is that how you learned about who would be speaking besides 
4 President Trump, or did you even know other people would be speaking besides 
5 President Trump? 
I didn't know who else was speaking. 23 
6 
7 A 
Q So were you following any specific groups on social media that were talking 
8 about January 6th? 
9 
10 
11 
12 A 
Q No one in particular. 
Great. 
And then how did you decide to come to Washington, D.C.? 
A I saw a post on Facebook of a woman who was running a bus trip to 
13 Washington to hear the President speak. I messaged her. She told me how much, 
14 where the bus was meeting, and what time to be there. 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Do you remember who this woman was? 
No, I do not. 
Did you know anybody else who went with you on the bus? 
My daughter. 
Other than your daughter, did you know anybody else? 
No, I did not. 
And so this was a bus. And what time did you get to D.C.? 
We got to D.C. after the President was done speaking. We missed the 
23 entire speech. 
24 
25 Q 
A Understood. Were you following the speech along on the bus? 
Most of the people's phones were dying. Their batteries gave out before  1 we got there. So I was unable to see most of it. 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 Q Did you hear any of it? 
A A small bit. 
Q Do you remember which parts that you heard? 
A It was the beginning. 
Q Okay. So you didn't hear President Trump --or did you hear 
7 President Trump mention marching to the Capitol? 
A 
Q 
down? 
A 
Q 
A 
Q No, I did not. 
Was anyone on the bus talking about his speech when you were going 
No. 
And no one was playing it loudly enough for you to hear on the bus? 
No. 
Understood. 24 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 So when you all did get to D.C., do you remember where you were let off the bus? 
A It was not where the speech had taken place. It was much closer to the 
17 Capitol. 
18 
19 
20 
21 Q Okay. And what did you see when you got off the bus? 
A Hordes of people walking towards the Capitol. 
Q Okay. And what were your thoughts when you saw this? 
A I didn't know. I didn't know what was going to take place. We joined the 
22 people and walked with them. 
23 
24 Q 
A Right. But you saw this group of people. Why did you want to join them? 
Not hearing the speech, not knowing what was going to proceed afterwards, 
25 we just didn't know. So we followed the crowd, got caught up in the crowd.  1 
2 
3 
4 Q Was the crowd saying anything when you got caught up in it? 
A Not that I could hear in particular, no. 
Q So what made you think it was a crowd that you wanted to join? 
A Because they all had Trump signs or some kind of paraphernalia that 
5 supported President Trump. 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 Q 
A Do you have a sense of what time it was that you got off the bus? 
No, I don't. 
Q Okay. Did you talk to anybody in the crowd once you got there? 
A Minor pleasantries. 
Q And was your phone still working at this time or was it dead? 
A The battery was very low. 
Q So were you communicating with anybody while you were walking to the 
13 Capitol? 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 A No. 
Mr. Willson. Just Carla, right? 
Ms. Lavin. Yes. 
Mr. Willson. Right. 
- Right. 
Mr. Willson. And I think, Jean, we could say timing-wise that it was probably 
20 before 2 o'clock that you got off the bus, right, given what we know about some other 
21 stuff? 
22 
23 
24 
25 Ms. Lavin. Correct. 
Mr. Willson. Right. 
Great. Thank you. 
BY 25  26 
1 Q And I know you were with your daughter, and I appreciate that you're telling 
2 us that you were talking to her. But I'll be more clear next time if I mean outside of your 
3 daughter if I have another question like that. So thank you. 
4 
5 Did you bring anything with you from the bus besides your clothes and the phone? 
A My backpack had jackets, hats. We didn't know what the weather would 
6 be. And I had a sign with me. 
7 
8 Q 
A Do you remember what the sign said? 
One side said: Trump won. And the other side said: Don't let seven 
9 states hijack our election. 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
17 in dispute? 
18 
19 A 
Q Do you remember why you picked seven? 
I believe the count was seven States that were in dispute over the results. 
When you say in dispute, who was disputing the results? 
I was from what I saw on the news. 
Do you remember which seven States they were? 
No. Not at this time, I do not. 
Okay. So which news organizations were telling you that seven States were 
Network news, local news, Facebook, peers. 
And I'm sorry to be seemingly pedantic and sort of annoying about this 
20 word, but when you say dispute, was that your own personal view that the count was not 
21 okay, or was it the idea that it was still unclear who had won? 
22 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A 
Q It was still unclear who had won. 
And that's according to what you read or saw and your views of the States? 
Yes. 
And were you aware at this time that all seven of those States had certified  27 
1 the vote, the electoral count, the vote, on December 14th already? 
A Yes, but I still questioned it. 2 
3 Q Okay. So, again, disputed not meaning whether there was a dispute in the 
4 States, but a dispute in your view that you didn't think that the vote was correct? 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 A Correct. 
Q Thank you. 
So I guess let's talk a little bit about what happened when you got to the Capitol. 
Do you remember what it was like walking up? 
A It was very crowded. 
Q And what was going on around you? 
A There were lots of people with signs, with flags. You know, they were all 
12 fellow Trump supporters. 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 Q Understood. Were they friendly? 
A Yes. 
Q So you didn't see any violence whatsoever? 
A No. Not walking to the Capitol, no. 
Q And I guess you were walking, according to Mr. Willson's estimate, you were 
18 probably walking up to the Capitol around 2 o'clock or so. 
19 Were you hearing loud noises at that time? 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 A Such as? 
Q Such as, like, bangs or sounds like explosions? 
A I heard bangs, yes. 
Q So, in your view, what were those bangs? 
A I did not know. 
Q But did you think this crowd was peaceful?  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Yes. 
Did you see tear gas floating around anywhere? 
I smelled something. I did not know what it was. 
You smelled something --
Foul. 
Foul. Okay. 
7 So, during that time, just if you can remember what you were --what was going 
8 through your head, if you're in a large crowd and you smell something foul, what were 
9 you thinking was going on? 
10 
11 
12 A 
Q 
A I couldn't see if it was a dispute among people or if it was worse. 
So I guess, then, why did you keep going through this big crowd? 
The bangs happened after we were already packed up against the Capitol. 
13 I didn't hear any bangs as we were walking to it. Once we were already close to the 
14 Capitol, we were packed in like sardines, that's when I heard the bangs. 
15 Q And was there ever a point when you're walking up to the Capitol and you 
16 see a big crowd in front of you that you questioned whether you should move forward? 
17 A There was nothing there. There was no no-trespassing signs that I saw. 
18 There were so many people that, if it were there, it wasn't well seen, or seen at all. 
19 Mr. Willson. Right. Jean, I want to ask you a question that might help them a 
20 little bit. And, frankly, it's important that I know it. 28 
21 When you --you don't have a lot of history of going to the Capitol, right? You've 
22 only been to Washington, D.C., twice before this? 
23 
24 Ms. Lavin. Yes. 
Mr. Willson. Okay. And, when you were approaching the Capitol, is it fair to 
25 say that you were a little bit more to one of the sides rather than, like, straight on with  29 
1 the center? 
2 Ms. Lavin. Only when I left the Capitol and walked around did I realize that that 
3 was what I was walking to afterwards, was the center. I didn't --I had no bearings on 
4 what side of the Capitol I was on at all. 
5 Mr. Willson. Okay. Because I know --the evidence is that you went up the 
6 stairway that is the Senate side stairway with the scaffolding that's put there for the 
7 inauguration with all the sheet coverings to your right as you go up the stairs. Am I 
8 capturing that correctly? 
9 
10 Ms. Lavin. Yes. That is correct. 
Mr. Willson. Okay. And, when you climbed the bike rack that's been turned 
11 sideways as if it was a ladder, you're at the bottom, you're really close to the bottom of 
12 that stairway. Am I right? 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 Ms. Lavin. Yes. 
Mr. Willson. Okay. 
I don't know if that helps, but -­
BY-
Q Well, just in terms of the timing then, Ms. Lavin, as you explained, you get 
18 closer and you hear bangs. 
19 What was your perception of what was going on at that time? 
20 A I could see some police, and I assumed that the bangs I was hearing was 
21 either pepper balls. I saw some people in the crowd who might have been tear-gassed, 
22 but now they were on a stretcher with people helping to try to get them through the 
23 crowd, and they were having great difficulty. 
24 
25 Q 
A So, at that point, did you think you were in a peaceful crowd? 
Yes, because I think the people who were injured were injured because of  30 
1 the police who were shooting whatever it was. I only --I can't say I assumed it was tear 
2 gas. I don't --I've never had tear gas before, so I don't know what it was like previous to 
3 that. 
4 Q Understood. But I think you mentioned, or Mr. Willson mentioned earlier, 
5 that you support the police. So why do you think that the police were using whatever, 
6 pepper balls, or what was going on at that time? 
7 
8 A 
Q I don't know. 
I'm just trying to get you to think back at that time. When you were there 
9 and you said you still thought the crowd was peaceful, I'm trying to understand why you 
10 would think it was peaceful if there's bangs and tear gas and people on stretchers? 
11 
12 
13 A 
Q I didn't see people in the crowd doing anything that was violent. 
Right. But why --
Mr. Willson. Ms. Lavin, would you agree that the crowd was pretty rowdy? 
14 mean, peaceful suggests that we're all holding hands and singing a song or something. 
15 It was a rowdy scene. Wouldn't you agree with that? 
16 
17 
18 Ms. Lavin. Yes. 
Mr. Willson. Okay. 
Ms. Lavin. But I didn't see anybody punching anyone else or pushing, shoving. 
19 I didn't see any of that. 
20 BY-
21 Q Okay. So, I'll just represent to you, you went --we read your court 
22 documents, and it mentions that you went in the Senate wing door, Which is the door 
23 Mr. Willson noted, at 2:24 p.m. That is very soon after the first people actually get 
24 through the door, like 10 to 12 minutes. 
25 Did you see anybody pushing up against the building, breaking windows, you  1 know --
2 
3 
4 A No. 
Q --pushing against police? 
A No. No, I didn't see that. I did see the rush of people going up the bike 31 
5 rack and making their way towards the doors. I did see that. But I didn't see the actual 
6 violence or how the doors were broken when it happened. I was behind the crowd. 
7 Well, not behind the crowd, but behind the people who did that damage. 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 inside? Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q So did you participate in the rush, or how did that happen? 
No. I wasn't participating in the rush, but I was kind of in the middle of it. 
And what did you think the people were rushing to do? 
Get inside. 
Did you hear from anybody around you about why they wanted to get 
No. 
Okay. I think-had a question. 
Mr. Willson. Just, Jean, at this point, it is becoming more of a protest, right? 
17 Like we're sort of changing modes a little bit. You have your sign. And there is some 
18 chanting going on of people saying stuff. I can't remember what. But we do shift at 
19 some point in this process into more of the protest mode. Would you agree with that? 
20 
21 Ms. Lavin. Yes. 
Mr. Willson. Okay. And you went through the doors. You did not go through 
22 the windows? 
23 
24 
25 Ms. Lavin. No. Through the doors. 
Mr. Willson. Okay. But you saw there was damage? 
- Mr. Willson -- 1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 Ms. Lavin. Yes, I did. 
Mr. Willson. Okay. 
Can I just ask -­
Mr. Willson. Sure. 
- I wasn't going to ask you this. 
But, Ms. Lavin, what is your definition of a protest? 
Ms. Lavin. Chanting, gathering. 
BY-
Q So I was going to ask quickly, as you saw individuals rushing towards the 
10 Capitol, going up to the doors, did it occur to you as you saw that that laws might be 
11 actively being violated? 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 A When I saw the broken door, yes. 
Q And did that synch with your understanding of a protest atmosphere? 
A I'm sorry? 
Q Did that synch with your understanding of a protest atmosphere? 
A Somewhat. 
Q Why is that? 
A Windows were broken. People were jumping through windows. That's 
19 not normal. 
Q But you would characterize that as a protest? 
A Somewhat, yes. 
- Thanks. 
- back to you. 
BY-32 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 Q So, Ms. Lavin, have you ever been to a protest before where windows were  1 broken or doors were smashed in? 
2 
3 
4 
5 A 
Q 
A 
Q No. 
Have you been to a protest where people stormed a government building? 
No. 
And I know we had this conversation with Mr. Willson earlier about events 
6 that happened in the summer, but I remember you saying something about Black Lives 
7 Matter protests. And some of those, I'll represent to you --well, actually, I'll just ask 
8 this. 
9 Were you aware of Black Lives Matter --allegedly Black Lives Matter protests in 
10 Portland, Oregon, that involved the Federal courthouse there? 
11 
12 A 
Q No, I don't remember that. 
Okay. That's fair. But you haven't been to a protest, then, that's gone 
13 into a building or broken windows. So can you explain to us why this still felt like a 
14 protest to you? 
15 A That was my mindset. I didn't create any damage myself. I was curious 
16 about the inside of the building. I wanted to see it. I had never been inside before. 33 
17 Q Right. But how does that have to do --what does, I guess, seeing people on 
18 stretchers, seeing broken windows, seeing people going through damaged doors, I'm just 
19 trying to just understand what that has to do with a protest. 
20 A Well, the people on stretchers were in the crowd. I'm not sure what 
21 happened to them. I can only surmise it might have been that they got hit with tear gas 
22 or a paint ball. I'm not sure. The man was blue as he went by us with people giving 
23 him CPR on a stretcher and another person trying to part the crowd to get them through. 
24 - One question that occurs to me there is why would you stay in the 
25 area if you were seeing people being carried out on stretchers? You mentioned you  34 
1 wanted to see the building, but was there another reason that you wanted to stay in the 
2 area, or was it really just that? 
Ms. Lavin. It was curiosity to a degree. 3 
4 - Were you worried about potential interactions with law enforcement 
5 yourself? 
6 Ms. Lavin. I stayed away from that. I had no issue with the police, nor do I to 
7 this day. If it came to me, I got away from it. 
8 Mr. Willson. And there was one point when you're in the building where, I don't 
9 know if it was law enforcement or security or someone says, like, "Oh, you shouldn't go 
10 that way," and you turned around and went a different direction. 
11 Am I remembering that right? 
12 
13 
14 Ms. Lavin. Yes. 
Mr. Willson. So --
- But you saw no law enforcement warning you against entering the 
15 building when you went through the doors? 
16 
17 
18 
19 doors? 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 Ms. Lavin. There was no law enforcement there. 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q B~ 
Can I ask what you were hearing at that time when you went through the 
Just the roar of the crowd. 
Were people chanting? 
Not so much, no. 
No one was --
Mr. Willson. But people were saying stuff, Jean. I want to help your memory a 
25 little bit on this one. I mean, there was, like, "Stop the steal." There was -- 1 
2 there.

14 
15 office? Ms. Lavin. Yeah, but it wasn't a big group of people. It was a few here, a few 
Mr. Willson. Uh-huh. 
- Right. 
BY-
Q And so I'll just ask specific phrases, then. 
You did hear people chanting, "Stop the steal," correct? 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Once I got inside, yes. 
Did you hear people chanting, "Hang Mike Pence"? 
No. 
Did you hear people asking where Speaker Pelosi's office was? 
I did hear that, yes. 
And what did you think that the people wanted to do with Speaker Pelosi's 
I don't know. I don't know what their intention was. 
Was it your intention, by being in the Capitol, to challenge the certification 35 
17 of the electoral vote? 
18 
19 
20 
21 A No. 
Q What was your protest about? 
A I didn't intend to protest. 
Q I'm sorry. You said it was a protest atmosphere. You brought a sign that 
22 involved saying seven States were in dispute. 
23 
24 
25 A Right. 
Q So were you --you were not there to protest? 
A I make signs for a lot of different things, and the sign that I made was to see  1 the President speak. And, in the audience, that's where I intended to be with my sign.

5 Q All right. But your sign was --
Mr. Willson. But, Jean, I want to -­
- Sorry, Mr. Willson. One second. 
Mr. Willson. I just --once you're in the building, it does become a protest to 
6 some extent on your end of things, or parading or picketing, I mean, whatever word we 
7 want to use. Things change while you're there. 
8 
9 
10 
11 Ms. Lavin. That is correct, yes. 
Mr. Willson. Right. 
BY-
Q I'm still --I'm just trying to understand, I guess, why you went into the 
12 Capitol in a protest-like atmosphere like this. 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 A 
Q 
A It was a mistake. I shouldn't have gone in. 
All right. And then I guess --
Yes. 
The Reporter. I'm sorry. I missed that last part. 
- Oh, I'm sorry. She says it was a mistake. 
Q 
A 
Q BY-: 
Right, Ms. Lavin? 
Yes. 
And then --actually, if you could just repeat the last sentence. I can't 
22 remember it. 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q It was a mistake was the last thing I said. 
Okay. Thank you. 
Do you remember where you went once you were inside the Capitol? 36  37 
1 A Once we entered the doors, I had no idea where we were. I think we went 
2 to the right, and I still really don't know where we are when I saw the video of where we 
3 were at certain times. 
4 Q Do you remember being in a circular room that had some statues on the 
5 outside and columns on the inside? 
6 
7 A 
Q Yes. 
So I'll represent to you, you were in there around 2:25 to 2:31. Do you 
8 remember what you saw in that room? 
A 
Q 
A People. Lots of people. It was very crowded. 
Did you see police officers? 
No. 9 
10 
11 
12 
13 Was that where I stood still for a while? I'm a little sketchy on that. 
Q That's okay. If you can't remember, you can't remember. 
14 But do you remember seeing a group of law enforcement anywhere while you 
15 were in the Capitol? 
16 
17 
18 A 
Q 
A Yes. 
And what was happening with that group? 
Not much of anything. There was one instance that we were in an area 
19 that had big circular columns, and there were some police at an oval doorway. There 
20 was maybe six to eight, possibly more behind them, and an individual from the crowd 
21 walked up to them and pepper sprayed the police. And they immediately tackled him, 
22 and we turned on our heels and got out of there, because we wanted no part of that. 
23 Q Right. So I guess at that point, do you think the crowd was mostly 
24 peaceful? 
25 A There were some individuals who became violent. And when we saw that,  1 we got away from them. 
2 
3 Q 
A And was this pepper spraying incident the reason that you left the Capitol? 
One of the reasons, yes. There was another area where we went to exit 
4 some doors, and there was either security or police at the doors, and the crowd from 
5 outside was pushing their way in. And, when that happened, we tried to find another 
6 exit to leave, because we didn't --that was not our intention whatsoever. We don't 
7 want any part of that. We support the police. 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Okay. Did you end up falling on your way out? 
Yes. That was near the pepper spray incident, yes. 
And are you okay? 
Q Oh, yes. 
Okay. -Yes. 
Good. Just want to make sure. 
did you have a question? -Are we wrapping up now, or no? --Oh, no. 
I'm okay. I just saw your face. 
No, no. I'm good. -Okay. I'll continue.

21 Q 
A 
Q So I'm guessing your phone was dead, but I have to ask, while you were in -­
It was very low. 
Did you become aware that President Trump posted a video to his Twitter 
22 that essentially asked people to go home and leave the Capitol? 
23 A No. The only information I heard was someone in the crowd said that 
24 someone had been shot, and that was another reason to leave. 
25 Q I guess, if you were aware someone got shot, did you think that this was still  1 a protest? 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 A No. 
Q Okay. Thank you. 
After you left the Capitol, did your daughter post something to Facebook? 
A 
Q 
A I realized that after it had already happened. 
Do you remember what she said? 
No. I don't remember the specifics. 
- One second. My computer froze. 
- I have a quick question in the meantime, Ms. Lavin. 
- Please. 
BY-39 
10 
11 
12 Q When you realized that it wasn't a protest anymore, what did you think that 
13 it was? 
14 
15 A It was turning into a riot. 
Q And did you see that sense of a potential riot when you were in the Capitol 
16 before you saw the pepper spray incident? 
17 
18 A No. I hadn't seen any violence up to that point. 
Q So you didn't think that there was --I know I asked you this question about 
19 your approach to the Capitol. But, once you got into the Capitol, you were not 
20 concerned about any illegality until you saw that conflict? 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 A I really didn't think about that at that time. 
Q That's helpful. 
BY-
Q Thank you. 
Okay. So my computer unfroze.  40 
1 The post --I'll read you the post that your daughter put on Facebook that day. It 
2 seems to be pretty soon after you left the Capitol. 
3 Quote, "This is history. We do not go burning down your city and stealing from 
4 your business. We come for the government officials that are ruining our country. We 
5 go straight to the source. Change needs to happen. That is our House, and you work 
6 for us." 
7 Did you talk to your daughter about this post before she put it up? 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q No. 
Do you have --
1 don't condone --I would not have advised her to post anything like that. 
Do you have any sense of where she got the language from? 
No. 
Why did she think government officials were ruining the country? 
I really can't speak for her. 
Okay. Thank you. 8 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 I guess --and then, did you go home after the Capitol? Did you get back on the 
17 bus to go to Connecticut? 
18 A We met at a certain small park at a certain time, and then I saw people who 
19 looked familiar from the bus, so we knew we were in the right spot. And then, at 
20 another designated time, we found the bus and got on. 
21 Q 
22 way home? 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A Okay. And did you have conversations with other people on the bus on the 
No. We were kind of in shock at everything that had transpired. 
So no one was talking about what had happened? 
No. The bus ride was pretty horrible on the way home --the condition of  1 the bus, the driver. There were other things people were talking about. 
2 Q Understood. All right. 
3 - Mr. Willson, our next question is --it might just be easier for you to 
4 answer this for the record. 
5 
6 
7 Mr. Willson. Uh-huh. 
- Can you explain the current status of Ms. Lavin's case? 
Mr. Willson. Sure. She is due to be sentenced on April 22nd in front of 41 
8 Judge Howell in the District of Columbia. She has sat --although it was over the phone, 
9 but we sat for a pre-sentence interview with U.S. Probation Office. They prepared a 
10 report. The next step is for myself and for Mr. Collyer, who represents the government, 
11 to file sentencing memos. 
12 - Great. Thank you. 
13 Mr. Willson. Uh-huh. 
14 Ms. Lavin, we only have a few more questions as we're wrapping up 
15 here. 
16 BY-
17 Q I heard you say that entering the Capitol was a mistake. Why do you think 
18 it was a mistake? 
19 
20 
21 A Well, in hindsight, look what has happened. 
Q Please explain that. 
A Well, now I face a charge of parading. Had I known it would have turned 
22 out like this, I never would have gone inside. 
23 Q Okay. So, when you say a mistake, it has to do with the criminal 
24 consequences of your action? 
25 A That too, but now I feel that I did trespass. I shouldn't have gone in. No  1 one should have gone in. 
2 
3 Q All right. And why do you think no one should have gone in? 
A Well, a woman was shot. Police were injured. Many reasons. It was a 
4 mistake. 
5 Q So do you still think that going into the Capitol was an effective or the best 
6 way for you to make your voice heard and for others to make their voices heard? 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 A No. 
Q Thank you. 
Have your feelings about former President Trump changed at all? 
A In what sense? 
Q Do you still support him? 
A Yes. 
Q Do you think former President Trump has any responsibility for what 
14 happened on January 6th? 
A In what sense? 42 
15 
16 Q Well, you didn't hear his speech, but in his speech, I can let you know that he 
17 mentioned marching to the Capitol with people. He talks about going to fight for your 
18 country. He makes a lot of comments about Vice President Pence needing to have the 
19 courage to do the right thing. 
20 Do you think that he, through his messaging, through his words, bears any 
21 responsibility for the fact that a lot of people marched to the Capitol and went into the 
22 Capitol and that bad things happened? 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A No, I do not hold him responsible. 
In your view, then, why did January 6th happen the way that it did? 
I really couldn't tell you. It's not because I know and I don't want to tell  43 
1 you. I mean, there is a lot of different factors. There were a lot of different players. 
2 Things have come to light afterwards that are not right. 
When you say things have come to light, what do you mean? 3 
4 Q 
A Well, I could start with the bus trip, that the reason why the gentleman who 
5 was driving went off the road, got us lost --supposedly lost --for quite some time, got us 
6 there after the speech, dropped us in a different spot. People I've seen on news 
7 organizations cutting fences. Why there were no no-trespassing signs anywhere that we 
8 could see. You know, people had different intentions going there. People calling for 
9 violence. 
10 Q Okay. So it is your understanding that there were at least some people 
11 who had called for violence and who did certain actions that, in your view --I'm trying to 
12 reword for you, so sorry, so tell me if I'm wrong --that did certain actions in your view 
13 that made what happened more likely? 
14 A Yes. And that only came to my understanding or come to light well after 
15 January 6th. 
Q Understood. 16 
17 
18 
19 - -goahead. 
BY-
Q So I was going to build on that point a little bit, Ms. Lavin. You were talking 
20 about various factions, some of whom were calling for violence before January 6th. 
21 You said earlier that you were just going to January 6th --to D.C. on 
22 January 6th --to hear the President speak. But, in light of all those other figures coming 
23 to January 6th to hear the President speak that day, why was it important to hear him 
24 speak then, on that particular day? 
25 A To show him that he has many supporters, and it might have been the very  1 last time that I saw him speak as President. 
2 Q Why was it important to show him that he had a lot of supporters on that 
3 day? 
4 A That we were disappointed the election turned out the way that it 
5 was --that it did. 
6 Q So I know that and asked you --might have asked 
7 you a version of this question earlier, but did you think at that point there was still a 
8 chance the election would turn out differently, or the inauguration would be different? 
9 
10 A I had hoped. 
Q And did you understand January 6th to be an important day in making that 
11 happen? 
12 
13 
14 
15 A Yes. 
Q Why is that? 
A Maybe it would not have been certified. 
Q So did you think that President Trump's speech on that day was meant to 
16 delay the certification of the election results? 
17 A No. Things progressed as they normally would progress. I don't think a 
18 President can change that. There's too many other people involved. 
19 Q That's a good point. 
20 So, if the President can't change that, but you thought that there was still a 
21 possibility it could be changed, how did you think it would be changed? 
22 A Maybe the States that were in question, you know, something could have 
23 come to light and maybe changed the results in those particular States. 44 
24 Q And would that have involved Congress voting to not accept the results from 
25 those States?  1 
2 A 
Q Perhaps. 
And how does that relate to the sign you were carrying about seven States 
3 not hijacking our election? 
Well, I was hoping that that would come true. 45 
4 
5 A 
Q And so, when the crowd was marching towards the Capitol, you were in the 
6 crowd, was there a moment when you hoped that would come true? 
7 A Yes. Well, wait. I don't exactly understand where you're going with that 
8 question. 
9 Q When you were entering the Capitol, did you think that entering the Capitol 
10 would help make that come true, that the election would not be certified? 
11 [Audio malfunction.] 
12 
13 
14 Mr. Willson. I can't hear what she's saying. 
- I think you're cutting out. 
Mr. Willson. Okay. Just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something that 
15 you were getting. 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 Ms. Lavin. Can anyone else hear me? 
- Oh, you're coming back now. 
Mr. Willson. Your video is frozen. How is your battery, Jean? 
Ms. Lavin. Good. 
Mr. Willson. Okay. Just making sure. 
So do you want to ask that question again? 
- Sure. So I'm not sure if you're here, but --all right. Looks like 
23 you're back. 
24 BY 
25 Q When you were marching to the Capitol, did you think that the crowd  46 
1 marching to the Capitol had any role in making the election results turn out differently? 
No. We weren't the decision makers. 2 
3 A 
Q Were you hoping to influence the decisionmakers when you were marching 
4 with your sign? 
5 
6 A 
Q No. Well --no, no. The answer is no. 
And protests, as we mentioned earlier, protests usually have a sort of 
7 political goal attached to it. So, when you saw the atmosphere, as Mr. Willson 
8 described, look more like a protest, in both of your words, did you believe there was a 
9 political motivation behind those protest actions? 
10 
11 A 
Q Maybe they had hoped as well as I did, but we couldn't force it. 
And, looking back, we spoke earlier about your discomfort, your disapproval 
12 of some of the protests over the summer of 2020, and you mentioned that there was 
13 damage to buildings and things of that nature. 
14 How do you distinguish in your mind now those protests over the summer of 2020 
15 and what ended up happening on January 6th? How are they different? 
16 A Well, what I saw in the summer was burning, looting, murder. And I feel 
17 that's far different than the Capitol on January 6th. 
18 
19 Q Even though that both looting and property damage and death happened? 
Mr. Willson. Well, but she said earlier that once she heard that someone had 
20 gotten shot, she was like, whoa, this is bad, we need to leave. 
21 
22 
23 it's --
24 -· Sure, but, Mr. Willson, I'm asking, looking back --
Mr. Willson. So I guess --well, you're asking a false comparison, you know, like 
No. I'm not asking --with all due respect, I'm not asking her to make 
25 a direct --I'm asking her, looking back, how does she differentiate between these two  1 events? 
2 Ms. Lavin. I can see where you're going with this, and I still believe there is a 
3 difference. How --
4 
5 - Fair enough. 
- We get that you believe there is a difference. We're just trying to 47 
6 tie down specifically what you believe the differences to be, given that, now that you look 
7 back, you do know that someone was shot in the Capitol. That there were people on 
8 stretchers. There has been reporting that people stole things from the Capitol, including 
9 Nancy Pelosi's laptop. There was property damage. 
10 I can tell you there were other things that happened, like people defecating in the 
11 Capitol and people urinating in the Capitol. 
12 So, given those details, can you explain a little bit how you differentiate the other 
13 protests that you talked about over the summer of 2020? 
14 Ms. Lavin. I don't understand the point that the riots of summer of 2020, what 
15 they hoped to accomplish other than death and destruction. 
16 
17 - So what was the protest on January 6th trying to accomplish? 
Ms. Lavin. I can't answer that. I don't know the mindset of everyone else. 
18 I've told you what brought me there. 
19 - But, looking back, you said you don't --you don't think they're equal 
20 events because you don't understand what drove the riots in the summer. 
21 So do you not understand what drove either riot, either protest? 
22 Ms. Lavin. No. I'm a little sketchy on the point you're trying to make or ask of 
23 me. 
24 ■-1!!!!!!!1 Well, we're just asking --so you differentiated the summer protests. 
25 You said, when we asked how to differentiate, you said you couldn't see the point of  48 
1 them, which is your, as we take it, a differentiation. 
2 So can you see a point to the January 6th riot? 
3 Mr. Willson. The riot or the protesting? Because I think she's already said that 
4 the rioting was bad. Like, she doesn't support that. 
5 - Mr. Willson, I don't want to get into semantics with you, but I don't 
6 think it's a --
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 Mr. Willson. Yeah. Well, you're confusing her, I think is part of it. 
- We can call it the event. 
- We can say the events. Let's call it the events. 
Q 
A BY-
What was the point of, in your mind, of the January 6th event? 
The dissatisfaction of the votes, how they went, and the questions 
13 concerning certain States at that time. It didn't seem legitimate. 
14 Q Okay. And you mentioned hearing "stop the steal." What did you take 
15 "stop the steal" to mean? 
16 
17 A 
Q Questioning the States who had a legitimate problem with the voting. 
So what did you think, then, that the people who were going in the Capitol 
18 were trying to do? 
19 A I have no idea what they were trying to do. I can speak for myself and 
20 what got me inside the building and how I felt about it. 
21 Q I understand, but what is your impression? We're asking if you had an 
22 impression about what the other people were trying to do. 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A Protest. 
And protest the vote specifically? 
Yes.  49 
Q And what would the protest hope to accomplish? 1 
2 A To maybe call into legal question about those States, whether we should go 
3 forward and certify a different President. 
4 Q So the ultimate hope would be that the certification of Joe Biden would stop 
5 and that Congress would certify President Trump? 
6 A Maybe not certify President Trump, but investigate fully and in depth the 
7 questionable States. 
8 Q And what would that investigation lead to? 
9 A The truth. 
10 Q Okay. Thank you. 
11 - - do you have any follow-up? 
12 - Yeah. 
13 BY-
14 Q 
15 interim? 
16 
17 A 
Q 
18 interim? 
19 A Do you believe the truth has been uncovered about the election in the 
I'm sorry. Could you say that again, please? 
Do you believe that the truth has been uncovered about the election in the 
I think it's too late to go back and say that it was definitely stolen, because so 
20 much has changed, so much has been covered up, so much has not been reported. 
21 can't say for sure. 
22 Q And what do you think of President Trump's continuing claims that the 
23 election was stolen? 
24 A It could be. It might not. I don't know. I think it's too late to actually 
25 get to the truth now.  1 
2 Q 
A 50 
So do you believe that --
Had something been done earlier, when things were called into question, we 
3 might have gotten more facts instead of cover-ups. 
4 Q So do you believe that Joe Biden is the duly elected President of the United 
5 States? 
6 A Well, he is. That's a fact. 
7 Q Understood. 
8 - That's all I have, 
9 Thank you,_ 
10 Just in closing, I know we've been here a little while, and we really appreciate you 
11 taking the time to talk to us today. 
12 So is there anything else that we missed that you think is important for us to 
13 know?

18 
19 
20 
21 Mr. Willson. No. I think that was very thorough. We're all set. 
- Well, I was asking Ms. Lavin. 
Mr. Willson. Oh, okay. 
Ms. Lavin, do you think -­
Mr. Willson. Jean, I --
- Do you think we missed anything? 
Ms. Lavin. I'm sorry. Did someone ask me a question? 
Yeah. Sorry. Ms. Lavin, is there anything that we 
22 talked --anything that we missed in our conversation that you want us to know or that 
23 you think is important to know? 
24 
25 Ms. Lavin. No. 
- Well, thank you.  51 
1 And just --we say this because we really do appreciate you taking the time to talk 
2 to us. We're here to get the facts, the circumstances that caused the consequences of 
3 what happened on January 6th, and to do that, we need to get all perspectives. 
4 And speaking to people like you who have a specific perspective can sometimes be 
5 a little hard, as you might imagine. So we are very appreciative of your willingness to 
6 talk to us and to answer all of our questions.

11 Ms. Lavin. I hope my statements helped. 
Well, thank you. 
And, unless you have anything else, Mr. Willson, we can go off the record at 5:57. 
Mr. Willson. All right.
