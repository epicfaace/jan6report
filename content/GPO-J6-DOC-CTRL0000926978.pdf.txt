This got stuck in my outbox. As I mentioned, most of the items mentioned in the Theis letter are not new and have been pretty 
thoroughly addressed by Michigan. For the four main buckets of allegations (Antrim County/Ballot handling/TCF 
center/observers), please see the State's statements/fact sheets linked below. 
1. Dominion systems/ Antrim County- all allegations addressed here: 
https:ljwww.michigan.gov/documents/sos/Antrim Fact Check 707197 7.pdf 
2. Ballot handling -some, but not all of the allegation topics, are discussed here under various headers: 
https://www.michigan.gov/sos/0,4670,7-127-1633 100423 102534 102535---,00.html and here: 
https:ljwww.michigan.gov/documents/sos/Fact check TCF Center allegations 707522 7.pdf 
3. TCF Center unsecured ballots -one variant of this allegation is addressed here in the final bullet:

4. Observers/ transparency- some, but not all, of the allegation topics are addressed here:

Received. We are aware of many of those claims and have discussed with Michigan over the last week, with Michigan addressing 
most of them. 
Will circle back with a more fulsome response as this letter is dated today so dont know if we've had a specific discussion w/ Ml on 
the request.

Has anyone from the State of Michigan reached out to CISA regarding the allegations in the attached? If so, please provide an 
update. 
Thanks.
