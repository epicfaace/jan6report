Yes, and you'll get a copy of the transcript. 5 
6 Mr. Durkin. Okay. But, that way, Julia won't have to kill herself taking

Okay. Thanks, Tom. 10 
11 Good afternoon. This is the deposition of Nicholas Fuentes, conducted by the 
12 House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States 
13 Capitol pursuant to House Resolution 503. 
14 This will be a staff-led deposition, though members may choose to ask questions. 
15 At this time, I'd ask the witness to please state your full name and spell your last 
16 name for the record. 
17

19 
20 
21 
22 
23 Okay. Nicholas J. Fuentes. And my last name is F-u-e-n-t-e-s. 
Thank you, Mr. Fuentes. Is the "J" an initial or is it J-a-y? 
The Witness. That's my middle initial. 
Great. And what's your middle name? 
The Witness. Joseph. 
Thank you. 
Mr. Fuentes, my name is and I'm an investigative counsel with 
24 the select committee. 
25 With me from the select committee staff are senior counsel and  4 
1 senior advisor; senior technical advisor; investigative 
2 counsel; professional staff member; nvestigative counsel; 
3 _, investigative counsel; professional staff member. And I 
4 think that's everyone. I apologize if I left anyone off. 
5 In addition, there are the following members in attendance: Mr. Adam 
6 Kinzinger. 
7 Under House deposition rules, neither committee members nor staff may discuss 
8 the substance of the testimony today unless the committee approves release. You and 
9 your counsel will have the opportunity to review the transcript. 
10 Note that, under House rules, you may have your attorney present but counsel for 
11 other individuals or attorneys from other government agencies may not be and therefore 
12 are not present. 
13 I would like to note for the record that what has been previously marked as 
14 exhibit 1 is the select committee's January 19th, 2022, subpoena for Mr. Nicholas J. 
15 Fuentes. The House deposition rules are included in this exhibit. 
16 
17 
18 At this time, could counsel please state their name for the record? 
Tom Durkin for the witness. 
hank you, Mr. Durkin. I believe you have two colleagues 
19 attending with you? 
20 
21 
22 Mr. Durkin. Yes. 
Can you please introduce them as well? 
Mr. Durkin. My paralegal, Julia Dratel, is on the --I don't know if you can see her 
23 or not. I can't. And my law clerk, Nicholas Athenson, is also on. 
24 
25 Great. Thanks, Mr. Durkin. 
There is an official reporter transcribing the record of this deposition. Please  5 
1 wait until each question is completed before you begin your response, and we'll try to 
2 wait until your response is complete before we ask our next question. 
3 The stenographer can't record nonverbal responses such as shaking your head, so 
4 it's important that you answer each question with an audible, verbal response. Do you 
5 understand? 
6 The Witness. Yes. 
7 Thank you. 
8 We ask that you provide complete answers based on the best of your recollection. 
9 If the question is not clear, please ask for clarification, and if you don't know the answer, 
10 please simply say so. 
11 You may only refuse to answer a question to preserve a privilege that's recognized 
12 by the select committee. If you refuse to answer a question based off of a privilege, 
13 staff may either proceed with the deposition or seek a ruling from the chairman on the 
14 objection. If the chairman overrules such an objection, you're required to answer the 
15 question. 
16 I also want to remind you that it's unlawful to deliberately provide false 
17 information to Congress. Providing false information could result in criminal penalties 
18 for perjury and/or providing false statements, including under 18 U.S.C. section 1001, 
19 which makes it illegal to provide a false statement in a congressional investigation. 
20 That being said, to be clear, this is a congressional investigation, not a criminal 
21 investigation. This proceeding is separate and distinct from any current criminal 
22 proceeding by the United States Department of Justice. 
23 Do you have any questions about what I just said, Mr. Fuentes? 
24 
25 The Witness. No. 
So, logistically, please let us know if you need any breaks. I just  6 
1 simply ask that, if you request a break, you answer the question that's pending before we 
2 break. 
3 If you don't understand a question, please simply ask me to restate it or clarify it. 
4 We aren't trying to trick you today, so if there's a question you don't understand, I'm 
5 more than happy to clarify it. 
6 Finally, I'll note that I'll be leading our conversation today but occasionally other 
7 staffers or even members may join in, and as members join, I will announce that they've 
8 joined the meeting. 
9 So, because this deposition is under oath, would you please raise your right hand 
10 to be sworn by the reporter? 
11 The Reporter. Do you solemnly declare and affirm under the penalty of perjury 
12 that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing 
13 but the truth? 
14 
15 
16 
17 The Witness. Yes. 
Thanks, Mr. Fuentes. 
, could we please pull up exhibit 1? 
This is the subpoena that was issued by the select committee to Mr. Fuentes on 
18 January 19th, 2022. I'll note that the exhibit contains the subpoena itself, a cover letter 
19 from the chairman, a document schedule with production instructions, and a copy of the 
20 House rules and regulations regarding conducting depositions.

So, Mr. Fuentes, I'd like to start with some really basic information to learn a little 3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 bit more about you. Can you tell me a little bit about yourself and where you grew up? 
A Sure. I grew up in La Grange Park, Illinois. I've lived there my whole life. 
9 And now I'm a livestreamer for a living. 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 Q 
A 
Q Great. And are you still in La Grange, Illinois? 
No. I am in Berwyn, Illinois, now. 
Great. 
Can you tell me about your educational history? 
A Yes. I went to Boston University for two semesters in 2016 and '17, and 
15 then I got an associate's degree from College of DuPage. I believe I completed that in 
16 2019. 
17

22 
23 
24 Q Great. Thank you. 
Have you ever served in the military? 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q No. 
Have you ever been employed by an office of government? 
No. 
Have you ever held elected or appointed office in government? 
No. 
Have you ever received grant money or a contract from an office of 
25 government? 7  8 
1 A No. 
2 Mr. Durkin. _, could I interject and just ask a point of procedure? 
3 As you know from our correspondence in response to your subpoena, under my 
4 advice he's going to assert the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. 
5 If I were there in person --he has a sheet that he will read from --I would simply 
6 point to that and, you know, nod my head or something. I don't want to interfere, but 
7 I'm going to advise him to answer that question with what I advised him to say. And I 
8 don't know you want to handle that. 
9 I think, for the sake of time, you know, if we have an --1 would recommend we 
10 have an understanding that if I think there's a question he should answer, I would say so, 
11 but, otherwise, from this point on, I believe, based on where your questions sound like 
12 they're going to go, I'm going to recommend he take the Fifth Amendment. 
13 Okay. Well, you know, we can --my plan is to proceed with the 
14 questions, and if you or Mr. Fuentes have objections, we can take a pause and you can 
15 either advise him to raise an objection at that time or Mr. Fuentes can raise the objection 
16 himself if he'd like to. 
17 And then I would ask that you explain --I don't know what the script says, but we 
18 do request an explanation for why the privilege is being raised. 
19 Does that sound okay, Mr. Durkin? 
20 Mr. Durkin. Well, but --no, that doesn't. That is disturbing to me. I already 
21 told you why he's --why I'm recommending that he take the Fifth Amendment. I've 
22 provided you that basis in the correspondence. I don't --I mean, is my correspondence 
23 part of the exhibits that you have? 
24 It is, yes. 
25 Mr. Durkin. I don't think it's necessary for me to restate it if it is in the record.  1 But, as you know, he has been told he is a subject and possibly a target of a Federal 
2 criminal investigation being conducted by the United States Attorney's Office for the 
3 District of Columbia. They confirmed that same status, as you know, quite recently, 
4 so --and, as I've told you, I think that's unfortunate, because, otherwise, he would be 
5 willing to testify. 
6 But the questions --I just think it's an impossible situation that he's in, in light of 
7 the pending grand jury investigation. So I don't want any of the committee to think 
8 we're trying to be disrespectful or anything else. You know, we have respect for the 
9 committee. But that's my advice. 
10 So, I mean, I don't consider taking a privilege to be an objection, you know. He 
11 has --
12 Absolutely. And I think you very helpfully just laid out the basis 
13 for situations in which Mr. Fuentes might raise a privilege in response to a question. So 
14 that was helpful, and thank you for doing that. 
15 
16 Mr. Durkin. Okay. 
And, just to clarify, I had asked if Mr. Fuentes had ever received 
17 grant money or a contract from an office of government. Are you raising a privilege in 
18 response to that question? 
19 Mr. Durkin. No, I'll let him answer that. Next --but --go ahead. Next 
20 question. 
21 Great. 
22 And I believe the answer was no, correct, Mr. Fuentes? 
23 
24 
25 Mr. Durkin. I think he already --he already answered it no, I believe, right? 
I just want to confirm. 
The Witness. Correct. 9  1

Mr. Fuentes, do you hold positions of leadership in any other organizations 
16 or corporate entities? 
17 A Upon the advice of counsel and in reliance upon the Fifth Amendment to the 
18 Constitution of the United States, I most respectfully refuse to answer that question on 
19 the grounds that it might tend to incriminate me.

21 structure for people who say that they're affiliated with the America First movement? 
22 A Upon the advice of counsel and in reliance upon the Fifth Amendment to the 
23 Constitution of the United States, I most respectfully refuse to answer that question on 
24 the grounds that it might tend to incriminate me. 
25 Q Thank you, Mr. Fuentes.  1 Mr. Durkin, if I might suggest something for the sake of 
2 expediency. I don't think it's necessary for Mr. Fuentes to state his full statement each 
3 time. If he wants to say "Fifth Amendment," that should be sufficient. 
4 Mr. Durkin. That's fine. 
5 We'll --with the understanding that that is shorthand for his full 
6 statement.

Fifth Amendment. 
Do you maintain an archive of all of your livestreams? 
Fifth Amendment. 
Mr. Durkin, I understand that Mr. Fuentes maintains at least 
7 some of his videos on his website, nicholasjfuentes.com. It appears to be publicly 
8 available, but it's behind a paywall. 
9 I'd like to discuss a way for the committee to get the videos that are available on 14 
10 that website that are behind the paywall. Is that something that Mr. Fuentes would be 
11 able to transmit to the committee? 
12 Mr. Durkin. I'd like to discuss it with him. I'm not aware of that, but, you know, 
13 it --that may be. 
14 Okay. Well --
15 Mr. Durkin. I mean, I'm not quite sure I understand. Are you saying that you 
16 want us to save you the cost of it? I mean, is it not something you can get to with 
17 a --I'm not sure what the question is. 
18 I'm asking whether you can produce the videos that Mr. Fuentes 
19 has made available to people who pay on his website. 
20 Mr. Durkin. You don't want to pay. Is that it? I'm just joking. That's a joke. 
21 Let me talk to him. We can --I don't see a problem with that, but I'd like to 
22 discuss it with him. 
23 All right. Thank you. And, you know, to the extent that those 
24 actual videos fall into one of the items within the production schedule, he's required to 
25 produce them pursuant to the subpoena. But we can discuss that after the deposition.  1

A 
Q BY 
Mr. Fuentes, do you make money from livestreaming? 
Fifth Amendment. 
Mr. Fuentes, I'd like to return to one of my questions. Are you currently 
6 livestreaming this deposition? 
7 
8 
9 
10 A Tom, can I answer this? 
Mr. Durkin. Not without talking to me. 
Can I talk to him ? 
Sure. If you want to mute and stop your video, we can go off 
11 the record briefly, and you can call each other or communicate however you'd like. 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 All right. We'll go off the record at 2:31 p.m. 
[Discussion off the record.] 
Let's go on the record at 2:32 p.m. 
Mr. Fuentes, I had asked if you're currently livestreaming this deposition. 
Mr. Durkin. And I'll represent to you that he is not. 
Okay. Thank you. 
18 Mr. Durkin, I'd like to understand the breadth of Mr. Fuentes' assertion of the 15 
19 Fifth Amendment. For example, I asked if he currently livestreams as a general matter. 
20 I'm not sure I understand why that would tend to incriminate him. 
21 Mr. Durkin. I think it could be a piece of evidence that could be used in the 
22 building block or the chain theory, that it's an admission that he does certain things, 
23 which would be a step towards some other piece of proof. 
24 Mr. Durkin, I'm not sure, if Mr. Fuentes' livestreams are available 
25 on line, why it would tend to incriminate him to answer the question of which  1 livestreaming platforms does he use or has he used. 
2 
3 Mr. Durkin. Well, we've had this conversation, 
One, frequently, government attorneys take the position that answering any 
4 question then constitutes a waiver, any substantive question. And I think those are 
5 substantive questions. 
6 I don't --I'll simply stand on my advice to him. I think it's a --I don't want there 16 
7 to be a waiver, and I don't want there to be --I don't want there to be any suggestion of a 
8 waiver. 
9 Is there a time period over which you're asserting Fifth 
10 Amendment privileges? 
11 Mr. Durkin. I'm not sure I understand that question. 
12 If I asked about Mr. Fuentes' activities in early 2020 or prior to 
13 that, is it your assertion that even answering those questions would tend to incriminate 
14 him? 
15 Mr. Durkin. I think it's certainly feasible it could be. It's my understanding from 
16 at least some charges that have already been brought that the government is 
17 investigating and bringing charges against people for conspiracy that begins, you know, 
18 well before some of those dates. So, I mean, yes, that would still be my advice.

Mr. Fuentes, where do you currently bank? 
Fifth Amendment. 
Have you ever been removed from a bank? 
Fifth Amendment. 
Well, Mr. Durkin, on that note, you have provided that 17 
9 information, at least some of it, in a letter provided to the committee. So I don't see 
10 why Mr. Fuentes would be prevented from answering that. You noted that --
11 Mr. Durkin. Well, the document --
12 
13 --the Bank of America credit cards were canceled, correct? 
Mr. Durkin. I've already given you that answer. I mean, the committee has 
14 that information. So I don't --
15 I guess I'm not understanding the scope of Mr. Fuentes' 
16 assertions if you've provided some information in a letter and he's raising the Fifth 
17 Amendment now in response to a similar question. 
18 Mr. Durkin. What was the question again? 
19 Has he ever been removed from a bank or has his account ever 
20 been removed from a bank? 
21 Mr. Durkin. Well, I think I told you in the letter that he received word that two 
22 credit cards at the Bank of America were --two credit card accounts were removed or 
23 canceled or whatever you want to say, whatever I said in the letter, and that he 
24 understands that they are also going to cancel the account. I don't think I said that the 
25 account had been canceled.  1 Okay. So his account has not yet been canceled, but his 
2 understanding is that it will be? 
3 Mr. Durkin. That's what it was at the time I wrote the letter. I haven't asked 
4 him about it since, but --is that a correct understanding, Nick? 
5 The Witness. So am I permitted to explain here on this one? 
6 Mr. Durkin. Well --I mean, I'm certainly willing to provide that information to 
7 the committee. I just don't know that I want him to answer the question,_ 
8 Okay. We can follow up, and maybe you can provide that 
9 information in writing? 
10

23 Q Mr. Fuentes, in December 2020, a French computer programmer transferred 
24 13.5 bitcoin, which was at the time worth around $250,000, to you and another about 
25 $25,000 worth of bitcoin to Patrick Casey. Did you know the donor?  21 
1 A Fifth Amendment. 
2 Mr. Durkin, you sent the committee a letter on February 2nd with 
3 an attached letter from the D.C. U.S. Attorney's Office that was sent to Bank of America 
4 requesting that they unfreeze Mr. Fuentes' accounts concerning the bitcoin transfer. 
5 So, in light of that letter, I'm struggling to understand why Mr. Fuentes would raise the 
6 Fifth Amendment in response to questions about the bitcoin transfer. 
7 Mr. Durkin. Well, I'd suggest you direct that question to the U.S. Attorney's 
8 Office. I would've --I would've thought, in light of that, we might have gotten word that 
9 he is no longer a subject of the investigation, but that's not what they said. 
10 So I don't know why they continue to think he's a subject, but that's --I can't 
11 answer that for you. I don't know. But that apparently --my only guess is that freezing 
12 an asset is one thing; indicting somebody is another. And that would be my guess. 
13 Okay.

9 A Fifth Amendment actually. 
10 Mr. Durkin, I'm not sure I understand the scope of the assertion 
11 here if --I'm asking whether Mr. Fuentes was aware of things that happened in reality. 
12 Mr. Durkin. Well, first of all, the answer is obvious that, you know, everyone is 
13 aware of that, everyone that can read and has a brain. 
14 It's the same issue, , and I'd rather not debate it. It's --you know, 
15 theoretically, that might be a link to some --I don't know. You just listed a number of 
16 organizations. I don't know whether they're involved in anti-vaxxing or anything else, 
17 but I don't think he has to admit to anything that would provide a link in the chain of 
18 prosecution. I'll stand on that. 
Okay. Thanks, Mr. Durkin. 19 
20 Mr. Durkin. And if I could --and I'm not a civil lawyer, so I don't know exactly all 
21 the rules of depositions, but, you know, I just don't understand the relevance of that 
22 question to the committee, as to whether he would --I would assume that they would 
23 know that he would be aware that there are people who take the position about 
24 anti-vaxxing. 
25 So, if I have to object on those grounds, I will, but I don't want to get into that,  29 
1 because I'll get in over my head. 
2 Well, Mr. Durkin, I was asking a broad question to set the stage 
3 for more specific questions. I'd just ask --
4 Mr. Durkin. That's what I thought. 
5 --that if Mr. Fuentes is going to assert the Fifth Amendment, that 
6 he does listen to each question and answer with "Fifth Amendment" if appropriate or 
7 provide an answer.

20 saw the police retreating" --and you later said to yourself --you later said, quote, "I said

22 You went on to say, quote, "To see that Capitol under siege, to see the people of

Mr. Durkin, I'm not sure I understand. 
Mr. Durkin. Well, I'm not sure I understand the basis of the question either. 
9 mean, if you know something I don't know --as far as I know, he hasn't been, but I'm not 
10 following the --
11 Well, thank you, Mr. Durkin. You just provided an answer to the 
12 question. I didn't understand the assertion of the Fifth Amendment in response to that 
13 question. But you confirmed that he has not been interviewed by Federal law 
14 enforcement in connection with January 6th. Is that correct? 
15 
16

18 
19 Mr. Durkin. As far as I know, I believe --can we talk? Can I speak to him? 
Yes. My --well, and I think --
Mr. Durkin. I think I --go ahead. I'm sorry. 
Can I preview my next question? 
20 And you may want to discuss that as well. 
21 Mr. Fuentes, have you turned over any records or devices to Federal law 
22 enforcement in connection with January 6th or since January 6th, 2021? 
23 And if you would like to take a minute to discuss, we can go off the record at 
24 3:13 p.m.

Okay. We'll go back on the record at 3:15 p.m. 
Mr. Durkin. ■■■■■ I I can represent that he has, to his knowledge, not 
4 been interviewed by any law enforcement, Federal law enforcement or any law 
5 enforcement, or turned over any of his devices or anything else. 42 
6 So, unless somebody was in his house under 2333 or whatever or the intelligence 
7 community is more clever than I think, as far as I know, the answer is no to that. But 
8 that's my representation. 
9 
10 
11 Q Well, we'll take that answer. Thanks, Mr. Durkin. 
Mr. Fuentes, Patrick Casey around February 2021 suggested that he believed 
12 that the FBI was attempting to infiltrate your movement. Did you have the same 
13 concerns?

10 Mr. Durkin, I'm not sure I understand the scope of the assertion 
11 there, but I'm not going to belabor that point. 
12 Mr. Durkin. Well, I could explain it if you want, but I don't think it's worth 
13 belaboring either. Obviously, there could be a connection between people involved in 
14 that and January 6th, you know.

19 colleagues have questions. 
20 And I would like to note for the record, I apologize I didn't notice that our 
21 
22 colleagu , a professional staff member, joined the meeting. 
Mr. Fuentes, Mr. Durkin, we are reaching the conclusion. We have not quite 44 
23 finished yet. But I would like to just take a 5-minute break to consult with my colleagues 
24 to see if there are any loose ends that need to be tied up. And then we can return for 
25 the last set of questions.  45 
Mr. Durkin. Yep. That's fine. 1

I believe my colleagu has some questions that she'd like to ask. 
Yes. 
Thank you, Mr. Fuentes, for your time today. I really appreciate it. 
And, Mr. Durkin, thank you for your time as well. And I know you've 
11 corresponded a lot with my colleague here, and I appreciate that, that investment in what 
12 the committee is doing here. 
13 Mr. Fuentes, I just had a few questions for you, and I'm guessing, based on your 
14 answers we've had so far, this will go pretty quickly, so just bear with me.

Fifth Amendment. 
So, Mr. Fuentes, I know you already declined to answer these questions 
11 earlier, but you are a quite popular and prolific social media influencer. My 46 
12 understanding is that you make your living off of that and collect most, if not all, of your 
13 money from that. 
14 And my understanding is that you've espoused most, if not all, of these beliefs 
15 that I just put forth and that you have worked very hard to convince a large number of 
16 people to agree with you on that and made money off of them. 
17 And I am a little surprised, quite frankly, that when given the chance to stand 
18 behind those beliefs on the record in an official proceeding that you have chosen not to 
19 do so. 
20 And I'm just curious what you think the people who have followed you and 
21 donated money to you and who have taken actions on your behalf or at your direction 
22 would feel about you not owning up to any of these beliefs when you had a chance. 
23 
24 Mr. Durkin. _, I'd like to interject -­
I'm sorry. One quick thing. 
25 are speaking, do you mind turning yourself on mute? when other people  1 
2 Mr. Durkin. Sure. 
respectfully, I'm going to object to that whole line of 
3 questioning on First Amendment grounds as well. I don't think that's appropriate. 
4 Mr. Fuentes may well have views that are unpopular. I think that's of record. 
5 But I don't think he should have to take this opportunity to defend his beliefs or do 
6 anything about his beliefs whatsoever, or his followers. 
7 And I just think that's kind of a bit of grandstanding, if you don't mind me saying 
8 that. I don't mean that disrespectfully, but I just don't think that's an appropriate 
9 question for the committee. 
10 I certainly understand your position on that, Mr. Durkin. I will 
11 note the irony of an accusation of grandstanding in a deposition of Mr. Fuentes. 
12 But I will say, I don't quite understand the First Amendment objection here. 
13 We're not looking to punish him for his beliefs at all. I'm trying to understand what he 
14 believes and whether or not he genuinely holds those beliefs. 
15 And given how ardently he has put them forth and how hard he has worked to 47 
16 monetize and to convince people of that belief, I'm just a little surprised that he wouldn't 
17 take the opportunity here today to stand by those. 
18 But I understand your objection for the record, so I don't think we have to go any 
19 further on that. I'll leave it there and turn it back to Thank you for your 
20 time. 
21 Mr. Durkin. Thank you. 
22 Thanks 
23 Okay. We're reaching the end of the deposition, and I want to take a pause and 
24 see if any other colleagues or, if any members are on, if they would like to ask any 
25 questions.  48 
Before I conclude, I'd just like to close the loop on a couple of things. 1 
2 One, Mr. Durkin, at the beginning, you asked about getting access to the record of 
3 the deposition. The committee won't make the video recording available, but you'll 
4 have access to review the transcript. And we can correspond offline about how to go 
5 about doing that. 
6 And with regard to some of the questions that I raised today about document 
7 production, I'd like to follow up with you soon about getting access to the videos that 
8 Mr. Fuentes has on his website that are behind a paywall and getting those produced to 
9 the committee as soon as possible. 
10 And, lastly, I was hoping, Mr. Fuentes or Mr. Durkin, if you could just walk us 
11 through the process that, Mr. Fuentes, you've gone through to assess whether you have 
12 any responsive documents to the committee's document request? 
13 Mr. Durkin. I think that you and I can work that out. We so far --you know, are 
14 we still on the record? 
15 Yes. 
16 
17 Mr. Durkin. And what's the question? What have we done? 
Yes. I just wanted an overview of the process by which you've 
18 determined whether there are no responsive records in some cases. I know you've 
19 raised privileges in response to some of the items, and I'm not --
20 
21 
22 Mr. Durkin. Yeah. No, I spoke --
--I'm not challenging that. 
Mr. Durkin. --I spoke to him yesterday. I have an issue I want to discuss with 
23 you offline or off the record on these chats. It's more of a burden problem than 
24 anything else that maybe we can accommodate. It's just becoming a bigger project than 
25 he thought, and I'm not quite sure how to handle it, because I'm not, frankly,  49 
1 sophisticated enough to --what I'm getting at is, there may be a way that I could find an 
2 expert or something that might be able to gather that information easier than he can. 
3 It's becoming more burdensome than he expected --which I'm happy to report I 
4 predicted he would have a problem with when I heard what the task was going to be to 
5 do it, like, individual screenshots. 
6 With respect to the financial records, as I discussed with you over his traveling 
7 expenses and so forth, I think I have a way of breaking that down to you that we can get it 
8 to you in a manageable format. 
9 Great. And I'm happy to continue the discussion offline. 
10 You've been very professional throughout all this, and I just want to acknowledge that 
11 you've been --your efforts to meet the committee's deadlines have been appreciated. 
12 I also just want to state for the record that the committee has not received any 
13 production thus far from Mr. Fuentes. And I'm not talking about the set of items for 
14 which you've raised privilege. Setting those aside. 
15 So, given the committee's pace of investigation, I just want to emphasize how 
16 important it is that we --to the extent that there are responsive documents and to the 
17 extent that you're not raising privilege on those documents, that the committee get those 
18 as soon as possible. But we can have that conversation. 
19 
20 
21 Mr. Durkin. I agree. I agree. 
Great. 
Mr. Durkin. The other problem, I might add, is that, unfortunately, Mr. Rascia's 
22 mother passed away last night, and so he's been very distracted, as you can imagine, for 
23 the last week or two. So it's been --and that's why he was not here today. He was not 
24 trying to be disrespectful, but she just passed away last night. 
25 Completely understood. I'm very sorry to hear that, and please  50 
1 pass our condolences on to Mr. Rascia. 
2 Mr. Durkin. Thank you. 
3 Okay. 
4 So I'm going to kind of state boilerplate language that is the committee's general 
5 approach when a witness has raised the Fifth Amendment in response to certain 
6 questions. 
7 Because Mr. Fuentes has asserted the Fifth Amendment as a basis to answer some 
8 of the select committee's questions today, we will not close the record on the deposition 
9 because the select committee has to determine the appropriate course of action moving 
10 forward on those objections. 
11 Mr. Durkin and your colleagues Ms. Dratel and Mr. Athenson and Mr. Fuentes, 
12 thank you for your time today. 
13 Last call for additional questions? 
14 Hearing none, the deposition will stand in recess, subject to the call of the chair. 
15 Mr. Durkin. Thank you. 
16 [Whereupon, at 3:36 p.m., the deposition was recessed, subject to the call of the 
17 chair.]  1
