2 So this is the deposition of Mr. Alexander Bruesewitz conducted 
3 by the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States 
4 Capitol pursuant to House Resolution 503. This deposition is being conducted remotely. 
5 Mr. Bruesewitz, can you please state your name and spell your last name for the 
6 record. 
7 
8 
9 Mr. Bruesewitz. Yeah. Alexander William Bruesewitz, B-r-u-e-s-e-w-i-t-z. 
Thank you. So this will be a staff-led deposition, although 
members may choose to ask questions. My name is I'm an 
10 investigative counsel with the select committee. Joining remotely on the select 
11 
12 committee are senior executive counsel; investigative counsel; 
professor staff, professional staff. There are currently no 
13 members present. 
14 So we will be following the House deposition rules provided to Mr. McBride 
15 previously. Under the House deposition rules, you are permitted to have an attorney 
16 present, but counsel for other persons or government agencies may not attend. So in 
17 other words, the only lawyers present are those from the select committee, and your 
18 counsel, Mr. Bruesewitz. 
19 Mr. Bruesewitz. Yes. 
20 At this time, I'd ask Mr. Bruesewitz's counsel, Mr. McBride, to 
21 please state his name for the record. 
22 
23 Mr. McBride. Joseph D. McBride, Esquire, on behalf of Mr. Bruesewitz. 
Thank you. So under the House deposition rules, neither 
24 committee members nor staff may discuss the substance of your testimony that you 
25 provide today unless the committee approves release. You and your attorney will have  4 
1 the opportunity to review the transcript after the proceeding today. 
2 So the ground rules for this deposition, there's an official reporter transcribing this 
3 conversation. They are joining via Webex. The deposition is also being recorded, but 
4 the reporter's transcript is the official record of this proceeding. 
5 When I ask questions, please wait until each question is completed before you 
6 begin to respond and we'll do our best to wait until your response is complete before we 
7 ask our next question. Does that make sense Mr. Bruesewitz? 
8 Mr. Bruesewitz. Yes, sir. 
9 The reporter cannot note nonverbal responses such as shaking 
10 your head or nodding your head. So it's important that you respond to each question 
11 with an audible verbal response. So for the benefit of the reporter and the record there 
12 may be many times where I might clarify what you're saying if you're nodding your head. 
13 So for example, if you're nodding your head yes, I'll say positive response from the 
14 witness. 
15 We ask that you give complete answers to the best of your recollection. If a 
16 question is unclear, please just ask me for a clarification. If you do not know the answer, 
17 please just say so. 
18 Also logistically, please let us know if you need any breaks or would like to discuss 
19 anything with your attorney in private. We're happy to accommodate you as best that 
20 we can. Seeing that you all are in the same location, we'll simply just turn or video off, 
21 we will go on mute, allow you all a chance to discuss and we will come back on the record 
22 when you all are ready. Does that make sense as well? 
23 Mr. Bruesewitz. Yes, sir. 
24 So today you may refuse to answer a question only to preserve a 
25 privilege recognized by the select committee. If you refuse to answer a question based  5 
1 on a privilege, we may either proceed with the deposition or we can seek a ruling from 
2 the chairman on the objection. If the chairman overrules such an objection, then you 
3 are required to answer the question. 
4 So, my goal today is to ask questions relevant to the committee's investigation, 
5 with the hope that you will answer it. If you have an objection or a privilege assertion 
6 we will ask that you assert on the record. I understand from your counsel that you may 
7 invoke the Fifth Amendment in response to our questions. But since we are aware of 
8 this objection, I will say that our goal is simply to understand the basis for your objection 
9 so we can fairly evaluate it. And ultimately, the more detail that you help provide about 
10 the basis, the easier it will be for the select committee to consider this objection. 
11 Finally, I want to remind you and we do this for all witnesses, Mr. Bruesewitz, it is 
12 unlawful to deliberately provide false information to Congress. And providing false 
13 information could result in criminal penalties, for example, under 18 U.S.C. 1001. Mr. 
14 Bruesewitz, do you understand that you cannot deliberately provide false information to 
15 Congress? 
16 Mr. Bruesewitz. Yes, sir. 
17 And do you have any questions about the information that I've 
18 covered so far? 
19 
20 Mr. Bruesewitz. No, sir. 
Okay. So because this deposition is under oath, would you 
21 please raise your right hand to be sworn. 
22 The Reporter. Do you solemnly declare and affirm under the penalty of perjury 
23 that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing 
24 but the truth? 
25 Mr. Bruesewitz. I do.  6 
EXAMINATION 
BY 1 
2 
3 Q Can we pull up exhibit 1 and we will start with the actual subpoena. So this 
4 is the subpoena issued to you Mr. Alex Bruesewitz, it is dated February 18th, 2022. Mr. 
5 Bruesewitz, do you recognize this as the subpoena issued by the select committee to 
6 you? 
7 
8 A I do. 
Q And do you understand that you are appearing here today pursuant to the 
9 subpoena? 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 A Absolutely. 
Q Okay, we can down it this exhibit. Thank you. 
Mr. Bruesewitz, where do you currently live? 
A West Palm Beach, Florida. 
Q And how old are you? 
A lturn25on-
Q Happy birthday. 
A Thanks. 
Q So we'll pull up exhibit 2. And we can scroll through this, are you the CEO 
19 of a company called X Strategies, LLC. 
20 
21 
22 
23 A I am. 
Q When did you start the company X Strategies, LLC? 
A I believe May of 2017 we formulated. 
Q What --can you tell us a little bit about X Strategies, what does it your 
24 company do, who are your clients, things of that nature? 
25 A We are a political consulting firm, but I am going to invoke the Fifth under on  1 who my clients are. 
2 
3 Q 
A Okay. Has your company advised any Members of Congress? 
On the advice of counsel, I invoke my Fifth Amendment right not to be 
4 compelled to be a witness against myself. 
5 Q And has your company, for example, advised former President Trump or 
6 members of his family? 
7 
8 A 
Q I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
So is it appears you're raising your Fifth Amendment. Mr. Bruesewitz 
9 which I understand you will be asserting your Fifth Amendment right, so questions that 
10 we ask today. 
11 Can we pull up exhibit 3? And just to give you some background, this is a video 7 
12 clip from Super Talk Mississippi that was posted on VouTube on January 17th, 2022. The 
13 title of the interview is "The January 6th Witch Hunt Continues." And so for context, this 
14 is an interview that you gave after the select committee first reached out to you, asking if 
15 you would voluntarily produce documents or answer questions. And I'd like to 
16 particularly play between the 2 minute and 30 mark to the 3 minute and 22 seconds 
17 mark. So we can play that. 
18 
19 
20 [Video shown.] 
Thank you. You can take this down. 
21 Q Now this interview was not under oath, of course, like our deposition is 
22 today. By I raise this clip to illustrate a point that I want to clarify, which is the Fifth 
23 Amendment protects your right to refuse to answer questions that if truthful, would be 
24 [inaudible]. So in other words, invoking the Fifth Amendment means that you think that 
25 if you were forced to tell the truth here today, that you would be forced to testify in a  8 
1 manner that you reasonably believe could be used in a prosecution against you. So do 
2 you understand that, Mr. Bruesewitz? 
3 A I invoke the Fifth Amendment after advice from counsel. 
4 Q And I'm saying this because all we want is the truth. From that video clip 
5 that I just played appears that you didn't go to the Capitol on January 6th, that you're a 
6 nonorganizer of any of the events. So do understand the Fifth Amendment protects 
7 your right to refuse to answer questions if the truth itself would be incriminating? 
8 
9 A 
Q The Fifth also applies to the innocent. 
Okay. Do you understand that it's not a valid basis to assert the Fifth 
10 Amendment if you do not believe that the truth itself could lead to prosecution? 
11 Mr. McBride. With all due respect, Counselor, we believe that our basis for 
12 raising the Fifth here today is constitutionally and legally valid. 
13 
14 
15 Q So we'll note that position for the record. Thank you. 
So we've already looked at exhibit 1, which is the subpoena issued by the 
16 select committee on February 18th, which compelled your appearance for this 
17 deposition. This subpoena also required production of documents which were 
18 described the schedule attached to the subpoena. And those documents included 
19 communications related to topics within the scope of the select committee's 
20 investigation. These included information about the rallies held in Washington, D.C. on 
21 January 5th and 6th, their funding, the security for these rallies, and the organizing of the 
22 rallies. Do you understand the subpoena required the production of document as well? 
23 A On the advice of counsel, I invoke the Fifth Amendment. 
24 Q And did you search for or locate any documents called for by the subpoena? 
25 A On the advice of counsel, I invoke the Fifth Amendment.  1 Q Can we pull up exhibit 4, please. So this is a letter that we received from 
2 Mr. McBride on March 6th, and in this letter, it indicates that Mr. Bruesewitz will not 
3 provide any documents to the select committee based on your assertion of your right 
4 against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. 
5 Is that correct? 
6 
7 A 
Q Yes. 
Is it your position that even just telling us whether you have text messages, 
8 emails, or other kinds of documents implicate your Fifth Amendment privilege against 
9 incrimination? 
10 
11 A 
Q On the advice of counsel, I invoke the Fifth. 
You also didn't produce a privilege log, so you think that doing so would 
12 implicate your Fifth Amendment privilege? 
13 
14 A 
Q On the advice of counsel, I invoke the Fifth. 
We can take down the exhibit, thank you. 
15 So can we pull up exhibit 5, please. So --and we can scan through this, scroll 
16 through it. Mr. Bruesewitz, this exhibit is the Stop the Steal website, so stopthesteal.us 9 
17 from December of 2020. So on the website, you were shown as being in Wisconsin with 
18 Ashley Stclair, Milk N Cooks, the TheGayWhoStrayed. Question here is when did you 
19 first start working with Stop the Steal and Mr. Ali Alexander? 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q On the advice of counsel, I invoke the Fifth Amendment. 
And how did you meet Mr. Alexander? 
On the advice of counsel, I invoke the Fifth Amendment. 
Can you tell us who the leaders of Stop the Steal was? 
On the advice of counsel, I invoke the Fifth Amendment. 
Were you considered an influencer for the organization?  1 
2 A 
Q On the advice of counsel, I invoke the Fifth Amendment. 
So we've heard from other witnesses about, you know, the difference 
3 between Stop the Steal the movement, and Stop the Steal the organization. In your 
4 eyes, was there a difference between these two? 
On the advice of counsel, I invoke the Fifth Amendment. 10 
5 
6 A 
Q Were you aware of or ever see Mr. Roger Stone playing any roles in advising 
7 Stop the Steal? 
8 
9 A 
Q On the advice of counsel, I invoke the Fifth Amendment. 
So it seems that your intention it to assert the Fifth Amendment privilege to 
10 all questions we ask about your knowledge about Stop the Steal the movement, and Stop 
11 the Steal the organization. Is that correct? 
12 
13 A 
Q On the advice of counsel, I invoke the Fifth Amendment. 
And to be clear, you are asserting your Fifth Amendment privilege in 
14 response to all these questions relating to this topic because you have --believe your 
15 answers to those questions might expose you to possible criminal prosecution. Is that 
16 correct? 
17 
18 
19 
20 A 
Q On the advice of counsel, I invoke the Fifth Amendment. 
Does any other staff have any questions about this topic? 
So I want to go back to November, shortly after the general election. The 
21 Kremer family with Women for America First helped organize rallies in Georgia after the 
22 election. Did you have any involvement in assisting with these rallies in Georgia? 
23 A On the advice of counsel, I invoke the Fifth Amendment. 
24 Q Can we pull up exhibit 6, please. So I will give you a chance to look, but in 
25 this exhibit you are in a chat with Mr. Ali Alexander and Ms. Kylie Kremer discussing plans  1 for a rally in Atlanta. Do you recall working with Ms. Kylie Kremer to organize rallies in 
2 Georgia, in early November 2020? 
3 
4 A 
Q 
5 organize it? 
6 
7 A 
Q On the advice of counsel, I invoke the Fifth Amendment. 
And do you recall this specific rally in Atlanta? Do you recall helping 
On the advice of counsel, I invoke the Fifth Amendment. 
And did you end up attending this rally in Atlanta? It appears from this 
8 message that you were supposed to come in on that Tuesday. 
A 
Q On the advice of counsel, I invoke the Fifth Amendment. 
Thank you. We can take down this exhibit. 11 
9 
10 
11 So there was also a rally in Washington, D.C. on November 14th, 2020, organized 
12 by Women for America First and others, including Mr. Ali Alexander. What was your 
13 involvement, if any, to helping plan this event? 
14 
15 A 
Q On the advice of counsel, I invoke the Fifth Amendment. 
Can we pull up exhibit 7, please. 
16 And we can just stay right here on this first page. So this group chat appears to 
17 be in relation to planning the November 14th rally in Washington, D.C. And we 
18 understand that there was some tension between Mr. Alexander and the Kremer family. 
19 It appears on this page that you are just trying to bring everyone together for the event. 
20 Do you recall sending these text messages? 
21 
22 
23 
24 A 
Q 
A 
Q On the advice of counsel, I invoke the Fifth Amendment. 
Did you help coordinate speakers on the November 14th rally? 
On the advice of counsel, I invoke the Fifth Amendment. 
Did you work with any congressional Members or their staffs to organize, or 
25 have them speak at the rally?  12 
1 A On the advice of counsel, I invoke the Fifth Amendment. 
2 Q Did you speak with anyone at the White House to help plan the November 
3 14th rally? 
4 A On the advice of counsel, I invoke the Fifth Amendment. 
5 Q So the rally on November 14th, it started at Freedom Plaza and it ended up 
6 at the Supreme Court. Was it always for the plan --was it always the plan for the event 
7 to end at the Supreme Court? 
8 
9 A 
Q On the advice of counsel, I invoke the Fifth Amendment. 
And another question that I'm just curious to hear from you as why was the 
10 event separated into two parts? So why was one at Freedom Plaza and one at the 
11 Supreme Court? 
12 
13 A 
Q On the advice of counsel, I invoke the Fifth Amendment. 
We also understand that former President Trump, he drove by the 
14 November 14th rally in his motorcade. Do you remember former President Trump 
15 driving by? 
16 A On the advice of counsel, I invoke the Fifth Amendment. 
17 Q And did you know in advance that former President Trump was going to 
18 drive by the rally? 
19 
20 A 
Q On the advice of counsel, I invoke the Fifth Amendment. 
So moving on from the November rally in Washington, D.C., we also 
21 understand there was a series of Stop the Steal events that were held at State capitals in 
22 November and December. Did you play any role in organizing these events as well? 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A On the advice of counsel, I invoke the Fifth Amendment. 
And did you participate in the events held in Wisconsin? 
On the advice of counsel, I invoke the Fifth Amendment.  13 
Q Why were these events held at State capitals? 
A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 1 
2 
3 Q Is it your intention to assert your Fifth Amendment privilege to all questions 
4 we ask about your knowledge of logistical finding of organizing a protest event in 
5 November and December of 2020? 
6 
7 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Q And to be clear, right, you are asserting your Fifth Amendment in response 
8 to all these questions because you have a good faith belief that the answer to these 
9 questions might expose you to criminal prosecution? 
10 
11 
12 
13 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Does anyone have any follow-up questions on that topic? 
Q Okay. So let's pull up exhibit 8, please. So this is a tweet from former 
14 President Trump where he says, "Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be 
15 wild." When did you first learn that supporters of former President Trump would be 
16 organizing rallies in Washington, D.C. on January 5th and 6th of January 2021? 
17 
18 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Q Was this tweet on December 19th the first time you had heard about this 
19 central protest on January 6th? 
20 
21 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Q And I guess let's go from the time period November 3rd, 2020, through 
22 January 6th of 2021, did you ever speak with anyone who understood to be working on 
23 behalf of the White House to organize support for events on January 6th? 
24 
25 A 
Q I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Did you ever work with or know someone named Caroline Wren?  1 
2 
3 
4 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Q What about Ms. Julie Fancelli? 
A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Q So we understand that you were also in contact with Members of Congress 
5 leading up to January 6th. What Members of Congress did you speak with in the 
6 lead-up to January 6th? 
7 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
8 Q And I guess, approximately, when did you speak to these Members is the 
9 more appropriate question about what --
A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 14 
10 
11 Q Can we pull up exhibit 9, please. And let's go to pages 5 and 6. So just so 
12 you know this is the Stop the Steal 2020 leadership group chat. It's a Twitter DM chat. 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 Mr. McBride. What page did you say? 
5 and 6, please. 
Mr. McBride. Thank you. 
Q Do you recall being in a Stop the Steal leadership chat on tweeter? 
A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Q So it looks like --and can you go down to the bottom of this page on the 
21 shared screen. Yeah. Go down to the top of page 6. So the question is, were you in 
22 communication with Representative Lance Gooden about objection during the 
23 certification on January 6th? 
24 
25 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Q And then let's go down to page 7 and 8. So the bottom of 7 and the top of  1 8. So then it looks like you posted, or put in the chat, a letter from Representative Ted 
2 Budd. So were you in any communication with Representative Budd? 
3 
4 A 
Q I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
If not Representative Budd or Representative Gooden, were you in 
5 communication with someone from their staff? 
A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 15 
6 
7 Q Oh, we can take that down, thank you. Let's pull up exhibit 10. So as you 
8 can see, this is an email where you're sharing a document called "Stop the Steal caucus 
9 members." So it looks like you're sharing this document on January 5th of 2021. What 
10 is the Stop the Steal caucus? 
11 
12 
13 
14 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Q Were you responsible for coordinating with Stop the Steal caucus members? 
A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Q And were these Members of Congress that were in the Stop the Steal 
15 caucus? 
16 
17 
18 
19 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Q Do you recall who you sent this list to? 
A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Q So is it your position today that producing this document, the Stop the Steal 
20 caucus members document, and emails associated with this document implicates your 
21 First Amendment rights against self-incrimination? 
22 
23 
24 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Q We can take that down. 
So we've also reviewed documents of the White House log of visitors. Do you 
25 recall going to the White House on January 5?  1 
2 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Q What was the purpose of your visit to the White House in the days leading 
3 up to January 6th? 
4 
5 
6 
7 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Q Who were you visiting? 
A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Q So the log itself shows your visitees as Camryn Kinsey. Who is Camryn 
8 Kinsey? 
9 
10 A 
Q I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Is it your intention to assert the Fifth Amendment privilege to all questions 16 
11 we ask about your knowledge of the logistical planning and organizing of January 5th and 
12 6th events? 
13 
14 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Q And to be clear, you are now asserting you privilege in response to these 
15 questions because you have a good faith belief that the answers to those questions might 
16 expose is you to possible criminal prosecution? 
17 
18 
19 so far? 
20 A 
Q I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Does anyone have any follow-up questions based upon what we've covered 
Moving on to January 4th, 5th, 6th that timeframe, just to orient you. When did 
21 you arrive in Washington, D.C. for the January 5th and 6th events? 
22 
23 
24 
25 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Q And where did you stay. 
A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Q Did anyone pay for your hotel room?  1 
2 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Q Can we pull up exhibit 12 and we can go to page 2. These are text 
3 messages between you and Mr. Ali Alexander. So we go to page 2 and zoom in a little 17 
4 bit in the top half of the screen. The it appears that you arrived in Washington, D.C. on 
5 January 5th, that you stayed at the JW Marriott before going to the Willard. Then you 
6 went to the January 5th event at the Supreme Court, and then you went to the rally at 
7 Freedom Plaza on January 5th. That's what it looks like in that text messages --this text 
8

What were your impressions of the event at the Supreme Court? 
I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
And what about your impressions of the event at Freedom Plaza on January 
I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Can we open up exhibit 13 and play the clip. So this is an expert from your 
16 speech at the Supreme Court on January 5th. We will just play this and I'll just ask some 
17 follow-up questions. 
18 [Video shown.] 
19 BY 
20 Q So during this speech that we just heard, you said that on November 4th, 
21 you got a text from your good friend, Mr. Ali Alexander, saying that we need to stop them 
22 from stealing the election, and then you created a coalition from there. Would you say 
23 you played a leading role in the collision with Mr. Alexander? 
24 
25 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Q And who is in this quote, unquote "coalition of patriots"?  18 
A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 1

Q Thank you. So in this clip that we just played for you, you say that you're 
6 working with a few dozen brave, brave patriots and dozens of your members, and a 
7 couple Senators that you work with who would be objecting. How many Members did 
8 you work with regarding a certification of the vote? 
9

Q 
A 
Q I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Did these Members seek out your help or your advice leading up to January 
I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Did Members that you worked with end up coordinating with Stop the Steal, 
14 and if so, which ones? 
15 
16 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Q You say here that Senator Graham told you that you were going to quote, 
17 unquote "going to cause a civil war if you object." So when did you talk to Senator 
18 Graham?

20 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Q And did Senator Graham explain why he felt this way that objecting would 
21 cause a civil war? 
22 
23 
24 
25 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Q Did other elected officials express similar sentiments to you? 
A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Q Can we go back to exhibit 9, which is the Stop the Steal leadership tweeter  19 
1 DM chat. And let's go to page 58. So page 58 it looks like it is 6:12 or 6:18 a.m. on the 
2 morning of January 6th. And you ask Representative Paul Gosar if he coordinated with 
3 all the members. How did you know Rep Gosar? 
4 
5 
6 
7 A 
Q 
A 
Q I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Did you consider Rep Gosar one of the Stop the Steal caucus members? 
I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
I guess a fundamental question I have is why is Representative Gosar in the 
8 Stop the Steal group chat in the first place. Do you know? 
9 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
10 Q So it looks like Representative Gosar responds to your question with "as best 
11 as possible" about his coordination. What was your why understanding about what his 
12 coordination was going to be? 
13 
14 
15 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Q You can take this down. 
Can we pull up exhibit 15? Thank you. So in the video clip that we played 
16 earlier, you said that you went to the rally at the Ellipse. And this email right here --can 
17 we scroll down so we see Mr. Bruesewitz's name in the red at the top of this chart here. 
18 You can scroll down. Right here. Okay. And this looks like you're on the VIP list for 
19 the rally at the Ellipse with other people, including Mr. Brandon Straka, Mr. Alex Jones, 
20 Mr. Roger Stone, among others. How did you get on the VIP list for the rally at the 
21 Ellipse? 
22 
23 A 
Q 
24 Alexander? 
25 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Did you coordinate with anyone to get on the VIP list such as Mr. Ali 
I respectfully plead the Fifth.  20 
1 Q How did --if you know, how did Stop the Steal identify individuals who were 
2 going to be on this VIP list? 
3 
4 
5 
6 A Can you repeat the question? 
Q How did Stop the Steal identify individuals to be on the VIP list? 
A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Q And we can take this down. Thank you. 
7 I guess just as background, can you share with us your impression of the event on 
8 January 6th? 
9 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
10 Q Did you see any civilians, so folks who are aren't law enforcement or military 
11 dressed in body armor, or like military BDUs near the Ellipse on January 6th? 
12 
13 A 
Q I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Did you coordinate with any members of the Proud Boys or the Oath 
14 Keepers, for example, regarding security on January 5th and 6th? 
15 
16 
17 
18 A 
Q 
A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Did you have personal security for yourself on January 5th and 6th? 
I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Q Can we pull up exhibit 16. I'm just showing you this tweet because we 
19 want to make sure we have the facts straight for the day of January 6th. So earlier I 
20 know on Super Talk Mississippi, you said that went to a rally at the Ellipse, but you did not 
21 go to the Capitol. It looks like on January 6th at 1:32 p.m. that you tweeted, "See you at 
22 the Capitol in a few minutes." So I guess the question is, did you actually end up going 
23 to the Capitol on January 6th? 
24 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
25 Q And if you did not go to the Capitol on January 6th, why didn't you go?  1 
2 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Q We know that there was an event at the Capitol that was hosted and 21 
3 organized by Stop the Steal. It was supposed to start at 1:00 p.m. So speaking of this 
4 event, do you know Mr. Stephen Brown? 
5 
6 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Q And do you know why the Stop the Steal permit application used the name 
7 "One Nation Under God" instead of "Stop the Steal." 
8 
9 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Q Can we pull up exhibit 9 again which is the Stop the Steal DM chat, and let's 
10 go to page 62. So we're still on January 6th, and it looks like at 5:15 p.m. eastern time. 
11 Again, Representative Gosar sends the group a direct message that says, "We're still on 
12 lockdown in the congressional office." And he sends it to the entire Stop the Steal 
13 group. So were you in communications with Representative Gosar throughout January 
14 6th? 
15 
16 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Q When did you first become aware that protesters were getting violent at the 
17 Capitol? 
18 
19 A 
Q I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
I guess the question that we have is just why --why do --to the best of your 
20 knowledge, why is Representative Gosar sharing that his office was on lockdown with this 
21 Stop the Steal group? 
22 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
23 
24 Q We can take that down. Thank you. 
So now I want to move into some just like your views of January 6th after the 
25 event, right? So in retrospect. So can we pull up exhibit 17, please?  22 
1 So on January 13th after the select committee reached out to you via email, you 
2 tweeted that you wanted the truth to come out about January 6th. You also stated that 
3 the committee does not want the truth to come out. In this tweet, you suggest that the 
4 select committee is focused on creating a fake narrative to undermine political 
5 movement. 
6 So with all the questions I have asked today, the goal has simply been to learn a 
7 truth about what you witnessed, personally witnessed leading up to it on January 6th. 
8 So what fake narrative have you perceived the select committee focusing on? 
9 
10 A 
Q I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
And that kind of leads me to another. Can you pull up exhibit 18? This 
11 is --just your so you're tracking, this is your interview with Mr. Tucker Carlson. And 
12 we're just going to play 30 seconds of this interview, and particularly at the 3:30 mark to 
13 the 4 minute mark.

17 Q You can take it down, now. 
So you say on here and the quote that stood out to me is that the American 
18 people deserve to know the truth about January 6th. And I just mentioned my goal with 
19 the questions that we've asked so far today. But it appears knowing the truth about 
20 January 6th is what may have some common ground, or hopefully we can work through 
21 and learn about your observations on January 6th. 
22 So since you were at the rallies on January 6th, and you were in contact with the 
23 organizers, and you have firsthand information that could be really helpful to the 
24 committee, this is why we are asking you these questions. So does that make sense? 
25 A I respectfully plead the Fifth.  23 
1 Q So I guess with that said of trying to, like, know the truth and understand the 
2 truth, did you have any role in planning the events on January 6th? 
3 
4 A 
Q I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Did you have any role or knowledge beforehand about the violence that 
5 would occur on January 6th? 
6 
7 
8 
9 A 
Q 
A 
Q I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Did you believe that the violence on January 6th was justified? 
I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Did you speak with any Members of Congress about the potential for 
10 violence that could occur on January 6th? 
11 
12 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Q And did you speak with anyone from the White House or anyone, like, on the 
13 staff of the White House, about the potential for violence on January 6th? 
14 
15 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Q So is it your intention to assert your Fifth Amendment privilege to all the 
16 questions we asked about your personal experience as a speaker on January 5th, and 
17 being a rally attendee on January 6th? Are you going to assert the Fifth for all these 
18 questions? 
19 
20 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Q And are you going to respectfully plead the Fifth for every question we ask 
21 about your observations and thoughts in retrospect after January 6th? 
22 
23 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Q And to be clear, you are asserting your Fifth Amendment privilege in 
24 response to these questions because you have a good faith belief that the answers to 
25 these questions might expose you to criminal prosecution?  1 
2 
3 
4 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Mr. - Does anyone have any follow-up questions? 
BY 
Q So Mr. Bruesewitz, have you been interviewed by law enforcement 
5 regarding your knowledge of events in Washington, D.C. on January 6th? 
6 
7 
8 
9 A 
Q 
A 
Q I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Have you been contacted by the FBI at all about January 6th? 
I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
So following January 6th, have you been contacted by any attorneys 
10 representing individuals that have been charged criminally on January 6th? 
I respectfully plead the Fifth. 24 
11 
12 A 
Q Is it your intention to assert your Fifth Amendment privilege to all questions 
13 we ask you regarding contacts made by law enforcement that's investigating the events 
14 on January 6th? 
15 
16 A 
Q I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
And is it your intention to assert your Fifth Amendment privilege to all 
17 questions we asked you regarding contacts made by attorneys that involve representing 
18 defendants charged with criminal conduct on January 6th? 
19 
20 A 
Q I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
And to be clear again, just to make sure it's clear for the record, you are 
21 asserting a Fifth Amendment privilege in response to these questions relating to your 
22 understanding --of relating to the law enforcement investigation, because you have a 
23 good faith belief that these answers could expose you possibly to criminal prosecution? 
24 
25 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Does anyone have any follow up about that?  1 
2 Q 25 
BY 
So Mr. Bruesewitz, at this point, you've asserted your Fifth Amendment 
3 privilege as a basis to refuse to answer pretty much all the questions we've asked today. 
4 And so under these circumstances, we cannot close the record on this deposition. The 
5 select committee determines the appropriate course of action to move forward. 
6 So before we go off the record, I will pause to see if any other staff members wish 
7 to offer anything else or ask any other questions. 
8 So at this time the deposition will stand in recess, subject to the call of the chair. 
9 We will go off the record at 10:42 a.m., eastern time. 
10 [Whereupon, at 10:42 a.m., the deposition was adjourned, subject to the call of 
11 the Chair.]  1
