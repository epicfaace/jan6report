Re: [EXTERNAL]$$$$$$ 
We should talk tomorrow about whether to just announce this by press release like we would any other 
fundraising announcement. 
If we have the numbers we can discuss how the breakdown among entities needs to be messaged. 
Also key, as Jason pointed out, that POTUS is on board with how it will be described.

Welp, sounds like we have 72 hours to come up with a messaging gameplan.

Fair points. 
Sean -what are the reporting deadlines for these respective entities -12/15? It will be tougher to dodge 
such answers after reporters can find it themselves.

I side with no comment. He's going to write about the split and if we say stuff about 
legal expenses it will serve to highlight the argument that the fundraising pitch is 
misleading.

+ Dallman, Jason and Bill 
I would still say no comment, but I also don't know if that number is correct. And 
whether it's something we want to inform if the story is going to get written anyway

Hi Tim 
I am doing a story on the Trump operation raising 
more than $150 million since the election, and am 
looking at the breakdown of the money and where 
it goes --with the PAC, RNC, etc. 
Can I ask what you all plan to spend the money on 
and what you've spend already? 
Also, some outside critics say it's unfair to ask 
small-dollar donors to give so frequently to help 
the president, when a lot of it won't go toward 
legal expenses. What do you say to those 
concerns? 
Your attention to my request, as ever, is deeply 
appreciated. 
Thanks, Josh
