Andrew, 
Happy New Year. 
I'm on a plane today at 2 pm Mountain time, but could do a call before that 
(and will try you just as soon as I'm packed and in the car driving to the 
airport). Or on my layover (4-5:30 MST). Or after I land (8:30 MST or later).

Dear Rep. Finchem: 
First, Happy New Years. 
Second, allow me to introduce myself. I'm counsel of record for 
President Trump in two matters that have been filed in the Supreme 
Court -motion to intervene in the Texas original action that was 
unfortunately dismissed, and a cert petition challenging three 
decisions of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. 
Bill Olson gave me your contact info. Sorry to trouble you on the 
holiday, but I'm trying to ascertain the status of the legislative 
subpoenas that were issued to Maricopa County.
