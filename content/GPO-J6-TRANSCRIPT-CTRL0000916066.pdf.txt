2 - Why don't we go on the record at 1:05 p.m. 
3 Good afternoon. 
4 This is a transcribed interview of Mr. Francis Connor conducted by the House 
5 Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol 
6 pursuant to House Resolution 503. 
7 And at this time I would ask the witness to please state your full name and spell 
8 your last name for the record. 3 
9 
10 Mr. Connor. My name is Francis Connor. My last name is spelled C-O-N-N-0-R. 
- Thank you very much. 
11 So this will be a staff-led interview, and at the time, I don't see any other staff 
12 members beside myself, investigative counsel i!ii!H hill, on the Webex. And if any 
13 members join, they can ask questions as well, but none of them have joined the Webex 
14 so far. 
15 And at this time, could counsel please state your name for the record? 
16 Mr. Gilsenan. Yes. John Gilsenan, Assistant Federal Public Defender, on behalf 
17 of Francis Connor. 
18 
19 - Thank you very much. 
I would also like to note that we have staff members 
20 -on the Webex as well. 
21 So as I mentioned, there is an official reporter transcribing the record of this 
22 interview. Please wait until each question is completed before you begin your response, 
23 Mr. Connor. We will try to wait until your response is complete before we ask our next 
24 question. It's just very hard in these virtual settings for the stenographer to hear us 
25 speaking over each other, so it's really helpful that we make sure to wait until the other is  4 
1 done talking. Also, the stenographer cannot record nonverbal responses such as 
2 shaking your head, so it's important that you answer each question with an audible verbal 
3 response. 
4 And we ask that you provide complete answers based on your best recollection. 
5 If the question is not clear, just please ask for clarification. If you do not know the 
6 answer, please simply say so. 
7 So I'm going to go over a couple of points to keep in mind as we're going along. 
8 First, it's important that you understand that this interview is voluntary. If at any 
9 time you would like to stop speaking with us, that is your choice. Similarly, if at any 
10 point you need to discuss something with your attorney in private, let us know, and we 
11 will take a break so you can have that conversation. 
12 Second, this interview is not under oath, but because this is a formal congressional 
13 investigation, you are obligated under Federal law to tell the truth, the same as if you 
14 were speaking with the FBI or the DOJ. 
15 It is unlawful to deliberately provide false information to Congress. For this 
16 interview, providing false information could result in criminal penalties for false 
17 statements. 
18 Mr. Connor, do you understand? 
19 Mr. Connor. Yes, I do. 
20 - Third, you are not obligated to keep the facts of this interview and 
21 what we discuss confidential. You are free to tell whomever you wish that you met with 
22 us, including the prosecutor or judge on your case, or you can tell no one at all. That is 
23 your decision. 
24 Fourth, the select committee is separate and independent from the Department 
25 of Justice. We have no involvement with the prosecutions, and DOJ is not a partner  5 
1 with the select committee in its investigation. The select committee also is not a party 
2 to your criminal case, and is not agreeing to submit anything on your behalf to the judge, 
3 nor can we make any representation whether, if you tell the judge you met with us, that 
4 the judge will be more favorable to you during sentencing. 
5 And I would like to note for the record that Representative Stephanie Murphy has 
6 joined. Welcome, Mrs. Murphy. 
7 Fifth, we have agreed with your attorney not to share the substance of what you 
8 say with the Department of Justice prior to your sentencing, but there are two possible 
9 exceptions. If you told us about evidence of a crime that we thought law enforcement 
10 was unaware of, or if we had reason to believe you lied during the interview, then we 
11 would be obligated to tell the Department of Justice or another appropriate law 
12 enforcement agency. And if you tell the judge that you met with us, please understand 
13 that may prompt questions from the judge about what you said, whether it is consistent 
14 with your prior statements and acceptance of responsibility. And if the judge starts 
15 asking questions, we may get asked to respond and divulge what you said. 
16 So just logistically, if you need any break for comfort, or if you would like to 
17 discuss anything with Mr. Gilsenan, just let us know. We're happy to accommodate 
18 that. 
19 And remember, like it might happen if you don't understand a question or I'm not 
20 clear, just ask me to repeat it. I am happy to do so. 
21 So with that, unless there are any questions, we'll get into the substantive part of 
22 the interview. 
23 
24 
25 Mr. Connor. Nothing from me.

16 Q Okay. Mr. Connor, where do you live currently? 
A Currently I live in Staten Island. 
Q All right. And how long have you lived there? 
A Three months. 
Q All right. Where did you grow up? 
A In Brooklyn. 
Q Which part? 
A Dyker Heights. 
Q All right. Cool. 
And what is your educational background? 
A I have about a year of college completed. 
Q Okay. And what do you currently do for a living? 
A I work at Amazon. 
Q All right. Have you had any other careers besides working at Amazon? 
A 
Q Nothing I would call a career, just temporary jobs. 
Understood. So, in general, how would you describe your level of political 
17 engagement during President Trump's term? 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 A I was up to date with the news. 
Q Okay. Did you follow President Trump closely during his 4 years in office? 
A Yeah. 
Q Okay. What sorts of information did you use? 
A What do you mean by that? 
Q Were you following him on Facebook, Twitter? Were you listening to NPR 
24 or some radio talk shows? Like where were you getting your information from? 6 
25 A From my own research. I mean, I had him on social media, but everything I  1 know is from my own research. 
2 
3 Q Okay. What does that research entail? 
A Just things that I may Google or something like that. If you're asking me 
4 what --how I stayed up to date with what Donald Trump was saying, it was through Fox 
5 News, maybe what was on his Twitter. 7 
6 Q All right. Yeah. So you used Twitter or you used Google; you followed the 
7 President on Fox News. 
8 Were you paying attention to any sites like Reddit? 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 A No. 
Q Okay. Did you have a Parler account? 
A 
Q 
A No. 
Did you ever visit anything known as TheDonald.win? 
No. 
Q Okay. Have you heard of a website called Gab, G-A-B? 
A No. 
Q So what do you think you used the most, anything besides Fox News? 
A Just Fox News. 
Q All right. So right after the general election in 2020, did you believe that 
19 the election was stolen from former President Trump? 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 A I believe that there was questions that needed to be asked. 
Q And when did you start to form that belief? 
A The night of the election. 
Q Do you remember why you started to form that belief? 
A Because five States flipped at about 5:00 in the morning when I was 
25 watching it on Eastern Coast Time after the polls were shut down.  1 
2 
3 Q So you stayed up all night watching the results? 
A Yeah, until like 4:30, and then I woke up and everything got flipped. 
Q And before the election, the immediate time before, were you paying 
4 attention to things President Trump was saying about the possibility of fraud in the 
5 election on his Twitter account or something else? 
6 
7 
8 
9 A Yeah. 
Q Do you think that influenced your views about the election results at all? 
A No. 
Q Okay. So why were you concerned that the States had flipped? 8 
10 A Because there was --they shut the polling down at, like, 2:00 in the morning. 
11 Then Donald Trump came out and spoke, and then I saw the leads that he held in 
12 Minnesota and Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and then the next morning everything 
13 was flipped. So I just thought it was very odd how it happened overnight. 
14 Q Do you remember what President Trump said that night? 
15 A I believe he said something like, I've never seen anyone shut down the polls 
16 like this, and in his own opinion, he won on the night of the election. 
17 Q And did you believe him when he said that he won on the night of the 
18 election? 
19 A Well, I believe that --I believe that's what he thought due to the fact that 
20 they're closing down polls and things like that were happening, and it looked like he was 
21 on the road to victory, so --
22 Q All right. But you know votes were still being counted. So what made you 
23 concerned about the fact that votes were still being counted? 
24 A Well, I just didn't understand why it would lead into, you know, weeks of 
25 counting and all the audits and things like that. It was just confusing.  1 Q So did you come to believe that the election was stolen at all after the 2020 
2 election? 
3 A I believe that there was fishy things that happened and questions that 
4 needed to be asked. 
5 Q Okay. But I'm asking specifically, did you believe that the 2020 election 
6 was stolen from former President Trump? 
7 A I'm saying that things that happened that were on, you know, video 
8 surveillance that happened were not along the lines of how an election should go in the 
9 country, so I believe that those questions are needed to be asked. 
10 
11 
12 Q 
A 
Q 
13 questions? 
14 
15 A 
Q President Trump did ask those questions. Right? 
Yeah, he did. 
And have you heard about any investigations into answering those 
Yeah. I heard about audits in, like, certain States and whatnot. 
Okay. And did any of those audits, or whatever, assuage your concerns 
16 about what had happened in the 2020 election? 
17 
18 
19 A 
Q 
A Not really, no. 
And why not? 
Because I feel like the news was just trying to basically label Donald Trump 9 
20 as being crazy for asking certain questions that needed to be asked and the news was just 
21 pushing it away. It wasn't a full-fledged effort of looking into what happened. That's 
22 what I believe. 
23 Q But was the news media looking into it or were government entities looking 
24 into what happened? 
25 A Due to what the news reported, I don't --I don't --I'm --I really don't know.  10 
1 I don't know what to think of what they said. It sounded one-sided. 
2 Q Okay. So let's go back to how you were feeling in the immediate aftermath 
3 of the election. 
4 In your statement of offense, there's some lnstagram messages between yourself 
5 and an Antonio "Ferrigno." Am I pronouncing his last name correctly? 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 I'm sorry, I didn't hear you. 
I think you cut out for a second. 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q It's "Ferrigno," his last name. 
Ferrigno, F-E-R-R-1-G-N-O? 
Yeah. 
And another, Anthony Lunyk, L-U-N-Y-K? 
Yeah. 
Okay. First, how do you know Mr. Ferrigno and Mr. Lunyk? 
Friends from my neighborhood. 
Okay. And is it correct that you went to January 6th with those two 
16 individuals? 
17 
18 A 
Q Yeah. 
So in these lnstagram messages, these are from your statement of offense, 
19 I'm just going to read a couple of them. 
20 So on November 3rd you said, "Get after it." Something along the lines of, 
21 "Don't let the Democratic Party destroy our country," end quote. "Preparing for war." 
22 On November 5th, quote, "Hopefully Civil War comes," close quote. "This 
23 election ain't over. It's going to be a fight, but we got this." 
24 November 9th you say, quote, "Be ready for Civil War to erupt because the 
25 liberals are going to riot," close quote.  11 
1 On November 10th, Mr. Lunyk said, "We're going to be at the epicenter of the Civil 
2 War," close quote. 
3 So those are a number of messages in which it sounds like war and fighting are the 
4 themes. Why did you use that language? 
5 A It's my private conversations with my friends. Nothing should be taken 
6 seriously. And I've already gone over this with everybody, so --
7 Q Well, I understand you've already answered these questions before, Mr. 
8 Connor, but we're not privy to your questioning and answering with the FBI, DOJ all the 
9 time. 
10 A I've just --I've gone over my private messages with everybody, and it's 
11 well-known that there was no intent behind those messages. That's my private 
12 conversations with my friends. 
13 Q Yeah. And I don't know who everybody is, and I have not heard or listened 
14 to those conversations, so just treat me as someone without any of that background 
15 knowledge, please. 
16 
17 
18 A 
Q 
A Okay. 
I'm just asking you, so why did you use that language? 
I don't want any war, no Civil --or any Civil War, anything like that. That's 
19 just me talking with my friends. That's how friends talk privately. 
20 
21 Q 
A Okay. Why were you talking about Civil War? 
Because it was a private conversation. It's just --no intent behind it. It's 
22 me and my friends joking around. 
23 
24 
25 Q 
A 
Q Do you think Civil War is funny? 
No. 
So how is it a joke?  12 
1 A Because it's just private conversations with my friends. I could speak to my 
2 friends however I'd like. 
3 Q I understand that, but it sounds like the topic here was about the election, 
4 and you're talking about war around the election and specifically use, it seems, 
5 Democrats were trying to destroy the country. So I'm asking what prompted you to use 
6 that specific language. Whether you're thinking of it as a private conversation, whether 
7 you're saying you're joking, I want to know why you're picking those specific words? 
8 A It was just a joke. It was in the moment. And, I mean, I had my own 
9 certain beliefs. I mean, things that needed to be investigated, things like that, I don't 
10 think it's a joke that those things could happen in this country, so --do you think it's a 
11 joke? 
12 Q Well, now I'm a little confused because you said these were jokes. Are they 
13 not jokes? 
14 A I said it in a joking manner. I don't believe that there should be people 
15 killing each other in the streets, but what I do believe is that there was needed further 
16 investigation into the election, so --
17 
18 
19 
20 Q All right. So how did Civil Wars --
Mr. Gilsenan. -if I could. 
- Sure. 
Mr. Gilsenan. Francis, I think what-is trying to get at it is, how are you 
21 feeling, what emotion was behind those messages? 
22 
23 
24 
25 Mr. Connor. I felt betrayed by our government. 
BY-
Q Can you expand on that a little bit more? 
Thank you, John.  13 
1 A I was just disappointed, and I felt betrayed in our government just due to the 
2 fact that there's a way things, you know, should work in the country, and things seemed 
3 one-sided and it was unfair to, you know, more than half the country. 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q So does that mean you did believe the election was stolen? 
I believe that there was fraud in the election. 
Enough fraud to tip the balance for President Trump? 
Most likely if the correct investigation was done. 
Okay. So besides these text messages --sorry --lnstagram messages after 
9 the election, did you participate in any, like, activities related to alleged voter fraud? So 
10 did you go out and collect affidavits for the Trump campaigns, litigation, or do anything 
11 like that? 
12 
13 A 
Q No. 
Okay. And did you between --actually, just after the election until now, did 
14 you make any donations to President Trump or other political entities --
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 A 
Q 
A 
Q No. 
--related to President Trump? 
No. 
No. Great. 
And did you attend the November 14th rally in Washington, D.C.? 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Yeah, I did. 
Okay. Can you tell me why you went to that? 
Because I wanted to. 
I appreciate that you wanted to, and you are free to do what you want -­
That's actually the reason. I have an appreciation for Washington, D.C., 
25 and I just think it's a nice place, and I wanted to go there with my friends. It was a nice  14 
1 day. I believe it was like a weekend, so we decided to go down there just to see, you 
2 know, what was going on. 
3 Q Yeah. But you could have done that another day. So why did you choose 
4 November 14th? 
5 
6 A 
Q What do you mean "another day"? That's the day the rally was. 
Right. So you wanted to go to Washington, D.C., to attend the rally, 
7 correct? 
8 A Yeah. But it wasn't a Donald Trump rally. It was just citizens. Donald 
9 Trump had nothing to --Donald Trump had nothing to do with that rally. It was 
10 formulated by people like myself. I didn't support --it wasn't like a Donald Trump 
11 campaign rally. 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 Q Do you remember the phrase "Stop the Steal"? 
A Yeah. 
Q Was it --would you consider it a Stop the Steal rally? 
A Well, that's what it was. That's what it was called. 
Q Okay. So what does the phrase "Stop the Steal" mean to you in the context 
17 of the 2020 election? 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 A It means stop the stealing of the election. It's exactly what it says. 
Q So do you believe that that message was to support President Trump? 
A Yeah. 
Q So was that rally, in a sense, a rally for President Trump then? 
A Yeah. It was for Donald Trump, of course, but it wasn't, like, the 
23 January 6th thing that was formulated by Donald Trump. Like, that was an actual 
24 Donald Trump rally where you have to go through security checks on January 6th, and 
25 things like that, and Secret Service, and whatever other people were there, before you  1 got into the rally. This wasn't like that. It was just a bunch of citizens met up in --I 
2 forgot what the park was called. It was right near the White House, and that was it. 
3 So, yeah, I mean, of course, it was for Donald Trump. 
4 
5 Q Great. What did you do that day? 
A We went to the --I'm forgetting the name of what the park was called, but 15 
6 we went to the park at, like, 6:00 in the morning. They set up a stage. There was just a 
7 bunch of Trump supporters from around the United States there. We had good 
8 conversations with, you know, people from different States and whatnot. And after 
9 they set up the stage, there was a few people who spoke. There was nobody --there 
10 was nobody like an important --you know, that held government positions that really 
11 spoke. It was just, you know, known Trump supporters from social media, and we just 
12 listened to what they had to say. 
13 And then after that, they walked down to the Supreme Court, and there was just a 
14 bunch of people on the megaphone, you know, saying to look into the election results, 
15 stuff like that. 
16 Q Do you remember if they asked U.S. citizens to do anything to further the 
17 cause? 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 A No, they didn't. 
Q So what was the hope and goal of the rally? 
Mr. Connor. Hold on. Let me speak to my lawyer. One second. 
-Yep. 
[Pause.] 
Mr. Connor. All right. What was your question? BY-
Q I was just wondering what the hope for the rally was. What was the  16 
1 outcome that they hoped for? 
2 A I feel like they just wanted to --they invited --Donald Trump's fan base got 
3 together and wanted to show their representation in Washington, D.C., which turned out 
4 to be a lot of people who came from all parts of the country, and they just wanted to 
5 show, I guess, how many people felt a certain way about the election results. 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 Lunyk? 
11 
12 Q 
A 
Q - Okay. And I would just like to note investigative counsel 
has joined, and I think you can see him on screen right now. 
BY-: 
And did you attend the November 14th rally with Mr. Ferrigno and Mr. 
Yeah. 
After the November 14th rally, were you continuing to pay attention to Stop 
13 the Steal social media accounts, Stop the Steal social media messaging? 
14 A Well, yeah. They were just on my --like, my social media feed. But after 
15 the 14th, after November 14th, that rally, I kind of just stayed in tune with the news and 
16 what was going on in, like, early December with, like, audits and stuff like that. I didn't 
17 follow --I didn't donate to anything. I wasn't out in, you know, the streets on my free 
18 time doing anything. I was just in tune with the news. 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 filing? 
out? Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q And do you remember hearing about court cases that President Trump was 
Yeah. 
Do you remember hearing that he was losing a lot of those cases? 
No. I remember hearing a lot of them were just being, like, thrown out. 
Well, how did that --what did you think about those cases being thrown  17 
1 A I think that with a topic as sensitive as the presidential election instead of, 
2 you know, looking into these cases with a very minimal, you know, effort, it should have 
3 been like the highest effort. And I don't think the highest effort was put into these court 
4 cases. That's what I believe. 
5 Q Highest effort by whom? Highest effort by the judges, highest effort by 
6 Trump's lawyers? 
7 A I just think that whatever level of government, whatever the process is, it 
8 should have been taken as serious as possible, and I don't believe it was. 
9 Q And just what makes you think that it wasn't, the fact that they're dismissed 
10 or something else? 
11 A No, just the fact that they were just dismissed upon, you know, 
12 presentation. 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 Q Okay. Did you also attend the December 12th rally --
A No. 
Q --in Washington, D.C.? You did not. Okay. 
But --so when did you find out about the January 6th rally? 
A Maybe the day before because Donald Trump posted it. Maybe like a 
18 couple of days before. It wasn't weeks before. Donald Trump posted it on his 
19 lnstagram, meeting at the Ellipse. 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 wild"? Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Are you talking about the December 19th tweet where it says, "Will be 
He says what? 
Said there will be a wild protest. 
On January 6th, he said that? 
He tweeted that on December 19th about the January 6th.  18 
1 A No. I think I was just aware that that was the day they were going to certify 
2 the election results, and the decision was made to go there literally like the night before. 
3 Q Maybe you can help clarify something because I pulled from your statement 
4 of offense that on December 12th Mr. Lunyk sent a message in lnstagram to, I believe, 
5 yourself and others that, by the way, electoral college final vote is on January 6th. 
6 And then statement of offense says that you guys were talking about going to 
7 Washington, D.C., for the next, like, 4 weeks or so. Was that not the case? 
8 A I don't remember that. I mean, I'm --I was very in tune with the news. 
9 knew that there was going to be something on January 6th. I didn't know that I was 
10 going until the day before. I had no part of the planning or anything like that. 
11 Q So you knew about the certification, but you're saying that you didn't learn 
12 about the rally itself until a couple of days before January 6th? 
13 A I don't remember when I learned about it. I mean, this feels like forever 
14 ago now, to be honest with you. I don't know if it was December 28th, January 2nd. 
15 You know, I don't really see it being, like, relevant, that answer, to be honest. 
16 Q Well, it's up for us to decide what questions are relevant to ask, Mr. Connor. 
17 Just as best you can, do you remember a message from Mr. Trump about the 
18 rally --
19 A I don't remember about the rally, messages, no. 
20 Mr. Gilsenan. - -
21 - Yes, go ahead, John. 
22 Mr. Gilsenan. Could I have a moment with Mr. Connor? 
23 - Yeah, yes. We'll mute. 
24 Mr. Gilsenan. I'll call you. 
25 Mr. Connor. How do we do that, John?  1 
2 Mr. Gilsenan. Oh, you're on the call. Okay. 
- I think he --1 mean, the best way we've handled this in the past is 19 
3 that he'll sign out and come back in, and you can have the conversation, unless you have 
4 another way to communicate with him. 
5 
6 
7 Mr. Gilsenan. No, because it's his cell phone. 
We can recess in place. 
- Yeah. 
8 And Mr. Connor can log off, take the phone call, and then we'll let 
9 him back in the room, and then we'll go back on the record. 
10 
11 
12 
13 Mr. Gilsenan. That sounds good. Perfect. Thank you. 
[Discussion off the record.] 
- We'll go back on the record. 
And I would like to note for the record that Representative Peter Aguilar has 
14 joined the Webex. So thank you for joining. 
15 
16 Q And I believe before we went on recess, Mr. Connor, I was asking if you 
17 remembered how you found out about the rally on the Ellipse on January 6th. 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 A I don't remember. I only remember Donald Trump's last lnstagram post. 
Q His last lnstagram post? 
A Yeah. 
Q Do you have any sense of what it said? 
A It was just like a 3-D picture of the Ellipse, something like that, and said, Join 
23 the January 6th rally starting at the Ellipse, something like that. 
24 
25 Q 
A Do you think that was early January? 
I believe it was, like, the day before, maybe January 4th.  1 
2 Q So just to step in --sorry,-- President Trump tweeted on January 20 
3 5th, "See you in D.C." with a picture. Is this the tweet that you're referencing that was 
4 the day before that led to your decision to come to D.C.? 
5 A It's --yeah, it's like a campaign picture, but I remember seeing it on 
6 lnstagram, yeah. 
7 Q Okay. And was it around, like, the middle of the day on January 5th or 
8 morning? Do you remember the time of day? 
9 A No. 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 No? Okay. Thank you. 
Sorry,_ 
- Totally fine. BY-
Q So was Mr. Lunyk talking about going to Washington, D.C. at all in the month 
15 between December 12th and January 6th? 
16 
17 A I don't really remember. 
Q Okay. And do you remember what made you want to go to Washington, 
18 D.C., on January 6th? 
19 A Yeah. I figured it was going to be --I never really attended --I went to the 
20 November rally, but it wasn't like a Donald Trump rally. He didn't speak. So I wanted 
21 to see him speak before he left office, you know, like at an actual rally, so I decided, you 
22 know, this is probably going to be, like, the last time he's, you know, President, and I'm 
23 able to go to a rally like this so why don't I go. 
24 
25 Q So you didn't think he would stay in office past January 20th? 
A All the events that happened in November and December, like the things  21 
1 we're talking about with the audits and whatnot, I just --I didn't think --I thought that 
2 they were trying to, like, you know, fight to maybe have something be done about it, like 
3 in terms of, like, the election results, but I didn't think that it was going to go the way I 
4 wanted it to go. So I figured, you know, like, let me just go see him one last time and 
5 watch him speak in person, and that's it. 
6 Q But you did understand that Congress was certifying the electoral college 
7 vote on January 6th, correct? 
8 A Yeah. But I didn't think it was going to go the way I wanted it to go and 
9 everybody else wanted it to go. 
10 
11 
12 
13 Q Understood. 
Did you take the rally, though, to be a protest of that certification? 
A Can you repeat that? 
Q Sure. Did you believe that the purpose of the President's rally and the 
14 purpose of the whole event on January 6th was to protest the certification of the vote for 
15 Joe Biden on January 6th? 
16 A I figured the rally was more of just him calling on his supporters, you know, 
17 to be together and maybe have him speak in front of everyone one last time. Like, I 
18 don't know what he expected out of it. I know that I wasn't --I didn't go to Washington, 
19 D.C., to protest. I went there to listen to Donald Trump speak and all the other people 
20 spoke before him, like Rudy Giuliani, Trump's family. I just wanted to hear him speak 
21 and see him in person, and that's about it. 
22 
23 
24 
25 Q And you said you --
- Goahead 
BY 
Q I was just going to say, if President Trump wouldn't have done that tweet or  1 lnstagram or called you to come to Washington, D.C., would you have come on 
2 January 6th? 
3 
4 
5 
6 A No. There would have been no reason for me to go. 
Thank you. 
- Great. Thank you, 
BY-22 
7 Q So I guess, then, you were paying attention to the news, as you said, before 
8 this time. Do you remember what President Trump was talking about? 
9 A No. But going back to question, it's --like I just want to 
10 expand on that. Yeah, basically I'm not the one to go and protest something. So, like, 
11 if there was no Trump rally --because it was, like, I looked at that day as two separate 
12 things. I went for the Trump rally at the Ellipse. Then the whole Capitol thing 
13 happened. I had no reason --if there was no, like, actual Donald Trump campaign rally, I 
14 would have had no reason --there was --going down to Washington, D.C., on January 6th 
15 wouldn't have even been a thought in my head. 
16 So, you know, I just went there to listen to Donald Trump talk one last time, and 
17 that's it. 
18 And_ I didn't hear the question that you asked. 
19 Q That's totally fine. 
20 I guess you were there to listen to President Trump speak, but President Trump 
21 had been talking a lot about the election being stolen in the time leading up to January 6. 
22 So was that a topic of conversation you were hoping to hear him speak about? 
23 A I just wanted to hear directly --since I figured that it was, like, you know, his 
24 last, like, legitimate --like the Republican's last chance at maybe overturning or looking 
25 into something, I wanted to just hear, you know, directly from him what he had to say.  23 
1 mean, obviously, the whole topic of it was, oh, stolen election. I just wanted to hear, 
2 you know, what was really going on for myself, and I wanted to hear Donald Trump talk. 
3 And he had Rudy Giuliani there with him, who was, like, his lawyer, and Rudy Giuliani was 
4 trying his best to, like, do things like that or look into it. I just wanted to be there and 
5 listen to Donald Trump speak one last time. So whatever he could have spoken about, I 
6 would have listened to. I wasn't paying attention for any specific topic. 
7 Q So why don't we just go to the day then. Speaking of what President 
8 Trump said, do you remember him talking about marching to the Capitol on January 6th? 
9 A I remember him saying, We're going to go over there peacefully and hope 
10 for Mike Pence to decertify the results of the election. And I believe that there was a 
11 stage, and there was, like, a set-up thing on the other side of the building, and that's 
12 where, like, things were supposed to be before they got too hectic. 
13 Q 
14 message? 
15 
16 
17 A 
Q 
A Is that the reason you marched to the Capitol, though, President Trump's 
No. 
Why did you march to the Capitol? 
I was actually going home, and at this point --because I was outside since 
18 like 6:00 in the morning. It was cold that day, and we wanted to go home. And 
19 we --once we got to the parking garage where the car that we were in was parked, I seen 
20 on, like, Twitter and I had some people, like, call me, like saying, Look at the news, like, 
21 look what's happening at the Capitol and whatnot. 
22 So just out of --we were there, and I was just --it's --I just wanted to see what 
23 was going on. Like that's why I was there. And so we walked over, and that was it. 
24 
25 Q BY 
So did you stay for all of President Trump's speech at the Ellipse?  24 
1 A We left --to, like, beat the crowd, we left about, I would say, like, 5 to, like, 
2 10 minutes before he was done talking. And then when we got into --then we parked 
3 far away, so the walk to the car was far away, and then we were in the car for, like --for a 
4 while before we, like, left. 
5 Q Okay. And when you say "we," who were you in the car with or who were 
6 you walking with? 
7 
8 A My two co-defendants. 
Q Got it. Okay. 
9 And you recall hearing President Trump mention the Capitol during his speech. 
10 That's correct? 
11 
12 A Yeah. 
Q Okay. And your testimony just now is that that's not why you went to the 
13 Capitol subsequently though? 
14 A No. Yeah, I wasn't going because --as I said, like, I understand people have, 
15 like, political opinions and their intellect, this whole protesting thing, but I --I don't feel 
16 like me being there, it's not going to change anything, so I'm not into that stuff. So it's 
17 not why I went to the Capitol. I didn't go there to, like, protest or because Donald 
18 Trump told me to. You know, I make my own decisions. That's pretty much it. 
19 Q Did you hear anybody else in the crowd next to you that was talking about 
20 going to the Capitol after President Trump said it? 
21 
22 
23 
24 A 
Q No, no. 
Okay. 
BY-
Did you hear anyone in the crowd talking about Vice President Pence after 
25 President Trump mentioned his name during the speech?  1 
2 A 
Q No. 
And how did you take it once President Trump said that he wanted Vice 
3 President Pence to decertify the election, in so many words? 
4 A I thought that it was --I thought it would have been a fair decision. 
5 Q A fair decision? 
6 A Yeah. 
7 Q By Vice President Pence to do that? 
8 A Yeah. 
9 Q And why would it have been fair? 25 
10 A Because there was more than half the country believed that there was some 
11 sort of fraud. So in terms of the American people, I think it would have been fair to the 
12 country. 
13 Q Did you understand the consequences of Vice President Pence not certifying 
14 the election on January 6th? 
15 A I believe it would have led to like a State-by-State audit or, you know, an 
16 extended period of just figuring out what was going on. What would have been the 
17 consequence? 
18 Q I'm just wondering what you had hoped for, that you said it was fair. And it 
19 sounds like you would have hoped for more investigations, correct? 
20 
21 A 
Q Yeah. 
And do you think those would have --there would have been enough time to 
22 complete those before the January 20th inauguration? 
23 A I believe that, if I'm not mistaken, like, the process would have been 
24 postponed. 
25 Q Okay. All right. Well, I want to back up a little bit. I jumped ahead a  26 
1 little bit, and I'm sorry. But Mr. Lunyk on January 5th, sent another lnstagram message 
2 saying, This is history in the making. 
3 Were you talking to Mr. Lunyk at all about the importance of January 6th before 
4 you got there? 
5 A No. It was just more of the --it was more of the fact if we believed 
6 that --you know, if Pence overturned the election results or decertified it, then it would 
7 have been history. It's just saying what it was, what it could have been. 
8 Q Okay. And I know you said you went there just to hear President Trump 
9 speak, but was it your understanding that other people went there in the hopes that the 
10 speech, the rally, protest, whatever, would lead Vice President Pence to not certify the 
11 election results? 
12 A No. I felt like, regardless of how many people went or what was said, Mike 
13 Pence was going to make a decision based off of whatever he wanted to do. 
14 Q So, in your view, then, all the people showing up were just there to listen to 
15 President Trump and not to do anything else? 
16 
17 A 
Q I can't --I don't know why they were there. I know why I was there. 
I'm asking for your view of what other people were doing. I'm not asking 
18 you to read their minds, just to be clear. 
19 
20 A 
Q I can't answer that. I can't speak for anyone else. I don't know. 
Okay. So what time did you get to Washington, D.C.? Were you there on 
21 the 5th, or did you get there on the 6th? 
22 A No. We got there on the 6th. We might have left on the 6th, too, at, like, 
23 12:00 a.m., like --you know, we got there very early, like 4:00 or 5:00 in the morning, I 
24 think, we arrived there, something like that. 
25 Q All right. And this is --you drove with Mr. Ferrigno and Mr. Lunyk, correct?  1 
2 A 
Q 27 
Yeah. 
All right. So the morning of the 6th, Mr. Ferrigno said in an lnstagram 
3 message, not to you, but to someone else, saying, Let's see what happens. It's going to 
4 end up being an all-out Civil War. 
5 So during the car ride down to Washington, D.C., or at all during that day, was Mr. 
6 Ferrigno talking to you at all about the idea of Civil War? 
7 
8 A 
Q No. We just listened to music the whole ride there. 
Okay. So you guys didn't have any conversations about what would be 
9 happening that day on your ride down? 
10 
11 A 
Q No. 
And I know you said earlier that messages about Civil War were a joke 
12 between you guys, but it seems to be repeating itself. So I just want to ask straight up, 
13 did you guys talk about the possibility of Civil War on January 6th? 
14 
15 
16 A 
Q 
A Civil War starting on January 6th? 
Yeah. 
No. We didn't --we didn't go there thinking that anything violent was 
17 going to happen. We just --it was --when we say Civil War, it's talking about from that 
18 time out into the future, like, what's going to happen. 
19 
20 Q 
A Can you expand on that? 
There's nothing to expand on. It's literally if half the country disagrees with 
21 the other half what could happen. We're not saying that we're pushing for Civil War. 
22 We're just talking. 
23 BY 
24 Q I guess the question is, war inherently is violent, right? It's not like we're 
25 preparing for future debates with half the country, or future disagreements with half the  28 
1 country. He used the term "Civil War," which was literally a war. So what were you 
2 expecting when you used that term, I think is the question. 
3 A Civil disagreement. I don't know. We're not sitting here, you know, 
4 saying we want war, we want other Americans to die, like, these are just conversations 
5 with my friends. I don't know. 
6 
7 Q Well, did you think January 6th would lead to more disagreement at the very 
8 least? 
9 
10 
11 A 
Q 
A If the results were decertified, then, sure. 
So isn't that the outcome you wanted? 
Yeah, but I didn't go there hoping --thinking that was going to happen. Of 
12 course, I'm a supporter of Donald Trump. Obviously, I want the best outcome for 
13 Donald Trump, but I didn't believe --with all of the events from the day of the election to, 
14 let's just say January 1st, the audits that were happening in November and December, I 
15 didn't believe that it was actually going to happen. Of course, I wanted it to happen, but 
16 I didn't think it was actually going to happen. 
17 Q I understand. But you said that, you know, the possibility of January 6th 
18 leading to more disagreements could happen if Pence decertified the vote, and it sounds 
19 like that's what you wanted to happen. So if you wanted the decertification of the vote 
20 and if you knew that would lead to more disagreement, it sounds like you were willing, or 
21 wanting more disagreement. Am I just misinterpreting what you're --
22 A No. I'm willing --if the election results were decertified, and I'm not 
23 concerned with how, you know, the Democratic Party feels. I'm not concerned with 
24 their disagreement. It's not what I'm thinking. I'm thinking of what's best and how 
25 things should work for the country. I'm not sitting here trying to start a civil war or want  29 
1 violence. Like, if that's what you're trying to ask me, it's not --you know, you're trying 
2 to, like, find an answer, it's just not --it's not making any sense. 
3 I'm a Donald Trump supporter. Of course, I want the best situation for Donald 
4 Trump. Am I going there trying to start a civil war? No. Did I believe that the 
5 election results were actually going to be decertified and things were actually going to go 
6 our way? No. I did not with my heart believe that. I didn't. I went there to listen 
7 to Donald Trump speak one last time. There's no more of an answer I can give you than 
8 that. 
9 Q For the record, we're not trying to put an answer in your mouth. We're 
10 just trying to figure out why you and your friends were using specific language that has, 
11 you know, a violent history and violent possibilities, as the words "Civil War" do. 
12 But --so you --what time did you get to the Ellipse that day? 
13 
14 A 
Q 6:30, 6 o'clock, 6:45, 6:30, something like that, in the morning. 
And were you excited to --I know you mentioned Rudy Giuliani earlier. 
15 Were you excited to listen to Mr. Giuliani's speech? 
16 A Yeah. There was a ton of people like in the Republican Party that were 
17 there. Of course, I was excited. 
18 
19 Q BY 
Before we get there,_ did you go inside the Ellipse, like the 
20 magnetometers, to hear President Trump speech, or were you outside of the fence? 
21 
22 
23 
24 A 
Q 
A 
Q We were inside of the fence. 
So you went through the security screening? 
Yeah. 
Do you recall certain people not getting through the security screening 
25 because they had weapons or something on them?  30 
1 A No. They --well, we were kind of like --we were towards the front of the 
2 line, and when we went through, we got through. And then, like, there was 
3 people --you weren't allowed to bring anything in. Like, there was --you weren't 
4 allowed to have, you know, a lighter, vape, things like that. I wasn't really, like, turning 
5 around and, you know, looking at what other people were doing. But I just know that 
6 whoever got past that security definitely didn't have any weapons on them, because it 
7 wasn't, like, you know, a normal security if you're going to, like, a baseball game. You're 
8 going to see the President of the United States speak, so it was --
9 
10 
11 Q 
A 
Q All right. 
--full-blown, you know, security. There was no --
We've seen pictures of, like, bags outside the fencing where people, it looks 
12 like they dropped their bags off to go in. 
13 Do you recall seeing anything like that? 
14 A No. I remember that if there was --for example, if there was something 
15 you weren't allowed to bring in, like, a lighter or vape or things like that, the people who 
16 were doing the search, everything got thrown in a bag. So maybe those were the bags. 
17 Q All right. Got it. 
18 And what was, I guess, the crowd size within the fencing compared to outside the 
19 fencing, if you recall? 
20 A So first it was --it was where --so, like, where Donald Trump was. Then in 
21 front of him there was about --there was, like, a square that was gated off. I wasn't in 
22 that square. I would say that square was about, like --I don't know --70 yards long 
23 maybe. And those were like --the people in there had, you know, lanyards on with, like, 
24 cards for, like, they were maybe part of his campaign or news reporters. People who, 
25 like, had to do with politics were in there.  31 
1 Then behind that was a separate section where I was, and that was just like the 
2 first people who were, like, in line, you know, nobody of importance. We didn't need, 
3 like, certification of any sort to get in there, but we were just there. There was, like, a 
4 fencing. And then the news cameras were behind me. 
5 And then, you know, all the people stretched all the way down to, like, the 
6 Washington Monument. Those people were not in the --those people didn't go through 
7 the security check. 
8 Q And from the pictures we've seen, it appeared there were a lot more people 
9 outside the security check than inside. Is that accurate? 
10 A Yeah. It's --yeah, for sure. It had to have been because I 
11 would --through security checks, I feel like out of all the people that were there, maybe 
12 only, like, 10 to 15 percent maybe were the people that were --that went through the 
13 security check. 
14 Q Okay. And there was room in there, right, inside of the --there was 
15 additional room. It wasn't like it was filled all the way to the fence, right? 
16 
17 
18 
19 A No, it was. 
Okay. Thank you. 
BY-
Q All right. So, Mr. Connor, when you were listening to Mr. Giuliani's speech, 
20 do you remember him talking about fighting? 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A In terms of, you know, fighting the court, sure. 
But, so those rhetorics you didn't seem particularly elevated or angry at all? 
Did I feel that way after what he was saying? 
Q Yeah, yeah. How did you take it? 
A I just took it as --whatever they said up on the stage was just like things that  1 they were repeating already said since the day of the election. It wasn't like anything 
2 new to me, you know. It wasn't --it didn't --it didn't make me feel any less or more 
3 emotional towards anything. 
4 
5 Q Did you think there was going to be a great reveal of some sort during the 
6 speeches? 
7 
8 
9 
10 A A great reveal? 
Q Like a reveal of new information or anything like that during the speeches? 
A No, I don't think so. 
Q Did you think there was going to be new information about the election at 
11 all that would have been presented during the speeches? 
12 A I thought maybe --so when I was there, the certification --whenever, like, 32 
13 Mike Pence, you know, signed or certified the election results, I was still at the rally, like, 
14 the rally. So I figured that maybe they would have, like, live news of, like, what's going 
15 on over there at the rally, you know. I wasn't expecting like, oh, a big something. 
16 don't know. 
17 Q Okay. So you didn't think that, for example, President Trump would 
18 present new evidence that the election had allegedly been stolen or anything like that? 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 A No. 
Okay. Thank you. 
BY-
Q Were you disappointed at all in President Trump's speech? 
A Was I disappointed? No. 
Q So it was basically what you expected? 
A Yeah. It was just --I'm pretty sure he went on a ton of rallies after the  33 
1 election, and it was kind of just like the same thing, like the ones that I have seen on TV, 
2 like it's the same rhetoric. 
3 Q Okay. So when you were walking to your car, were there other people 
4 around you guys? 
Yeah, of course. 
Were any of them talking about what President Trump had said? 5 
6 
7 A 
Q 
A No. I remember that we weren't --it's not like we were just --we weren't 
8 taking our time. We wanted to get back to the car. We were freezing cold. 
9 wasn't --I don't remember anything, you know, specific about what any of the people 
10 who were next to me said. 
11 
12 
13 Q 
A 
Q You don't remember any chants going on at the time? 
No. 
Okay. So when did you decide to head towards the Capitol instead of 
14 leaving Washington, D.C.? 
15 A Oh, when? Ah, I don't know the exact time. I would say maybe, like, 2:00 
16 p.m., 2:20, something like that. 
17 Q That's helpful. Thank you. 
18 And I think we talked a little bit about it before, but can you remind me again why 
19 you all decided to go instead of leaving Washington, D.C.? 
20 A Well, we just wanted to see what was going on, and you couldn't leave --you 
21 couldn't leave Washington, D.C., that day anyways. It wasn't like you could just get on 
22 the highway and go out. There was so many people there. There was a ton of traffic. 
23 There was --so we were just like, listen, we couldn't even get up sidewalks. Like it 
24 took --once we got in the car and then drove to --and we didn't even drive, like, near the 
25 Capitol. We had to park the car somewhere and walk another, like --like a lengthy  34 
1 distance because there was so many people and so much traffic. 
2 So we just --we walked over there just because we were, like, let's just go see 
3 what's going on over there, why is it like that. 
4 
5 Q 
A All right. And when you got there, what were you seeing? 
When we approached from, like, the grass thing or whatever it is in front, we 
6 just saw a ton of people with Trump flags, and then there was the --there was scaffolding 
7 up, I think, that was for the inauguration or maybe it was just there. I don't know. And 
8 it was just like a ton of people on the scaffolding in the front of the building. And there 
9 was just a ton of people going towards the building. 
10 Q So you probably --according to your statement of offense, you entered the 
11 west side, which is the side you were on with the inaugural stage on it, at around 3:08 
12 p.m. So it sounds like you were walking up a little before 3 o'clock, let's say 2:30 or so 
13 on. -and I can tell you there was a lot of violence happening at that time, 
14 scuffling with police. 
15 
16 So did you see tear gas? Did you see anything like that? 
A There was like a, I guess, smokey aroma. It could have --probably was tear 
17 gas. I don't know. But from what I saw, I didn't really see, you know, that much 
18 violence going on. I just saw a ton of people just walking back and forth, taking pictures 
19 and stuff. 
20 Q What did you think about people climbing up scaffolding? 
21 A You know, the people on the scaffolding and then there was also people 
22 climbing up the wall, like I'm sure you saw it. I was just like, why are they doing that? 
23 You know, they could fall and get hurt. It's kind of stupid, is what I thought. 
24 
25 Q 
A Did that give you any pause about moving forward towards the Capitol? 
No. It was just like why. I was --when I walked --when we walked  35 
1 towards it, we seen the people climbing on the wall, and then I was just, like, why are 
2 these people climbing on the wall. And then we walked around left, and there was just, 
3 like, a staircase that could have been used instead of, like, climbing on the wall. And I 
4 was just, like, why would these people be climbing on the wall; they could just be using 
5 the staircase. 
6 Q Did you see any police officers trying to tell people not to go towards the 
7 Capitol? 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 A Not at all, no. 
Q All right. What effect did the tear gas --
A In fact, I asked if what I was doing was okay, and they told me yes. 
Q You asked police officers that? 
A Yeah. If you see right on the security camera when I walk in, there's a 
13 group of police officers, and I have high respect for them and what they do, and I'm not 
14 someone who --if I knew I was doing something wrong, I would have been nowhere near 
15 it, believe me. I went and asked them, I said, you know, Is this okay? And they said, 
16 Yeah. Don't break anything, don't be violent, you're fine. That's what they told me. 
17 So if they told me, Turn around, don't go through this door or don't approach the 
18 property or don't walk up the staircase, I would have been nowhere near the Capitol 
19 building.

21 
22 
23 
24 Q Let's backtrack a little bit. 
So you arrived at the Capitol around 3 o'clock. You just said that, right? 
A Yeah, something like that. 
Q And you said you saw tear gas and other arms being deployed on the crowd 
25 as you walked up to the Capitol, correct?  36 
1 A No. There was not --it's not like I saw a whole big smoke show of tear gas. 
2 I just --it seemed as if it was a smokey aroma. It was not near me. I didn't --

A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q You saw a smokey aroma as you were walking to the Capitol, Correct? 
Yeah, but it was not in my way or direction or anything like that. 
And you witnessed violence? 
No. 
You had to have witnessed violence as you walked into the west side? 
No. 
So you're going to say here -­
Yeah, I'm going to say --
--on the record right now that you witnessed no violence on the way to the 
12 Capitol after 3 o'clock, between 2 and 3 o'clock on January 6th? Is that your testimony? 
13 A I'm not going to lie about it. I'm telling you I didn't see --
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Mr. Connor, Mr. Connor, my question is, as you walked to the Capitol --
1 just said I didn't see any violence. 
Let me finish. Let me finish, Mr. Connor. 
Okay. 
As you're walking to the Capitol after 2 o'clock and as you arrive at the 
19 Capitol at 3 o'clock, your testimony here today to Congress is that you did not witness any 
20 violence? 
21 A I did not see any violence. As I walked up the left side, if I saw violence, I 
22 would have been very far away. 
23 
24 
25 Q 
A It's a yes or no question. Did you witness any violence? 
I just said no, and no. 
Thank you.  1 
2 Q So and then I guess when you're getting into the Capitol, you're telling 
3 me --us that you asked an officer if it was okay. But, according to your statement of 
4 offense, you went into a Senator's office and rifled through some books. Is that 
5 something that you just thought would be okay to do? 
6 A Well, in terms of what everything --you know, everything else that was 
7 going on, I just looked at the books to see who was there, and that was it. 
8 BY

10 
11 Q 
A 
Q Mr. Connor, you're familiar with Baked Alaska, correct? 
After that day I was. 
And you're familiar with the fact that he recorded everything inside the 
12 Capitol that day? Correct? 
13 A Okay. 
14 
15 
16 Q 
A 
Q It's a yes or no. 
Yeah. 
So if we go back as investigators and looked at Baked Alaska's stream from 
17 that day, which you're inside, you're telling us that we won't see any violence in that 
18 stream? 
19 
20 A 
Q How long was he there? 
That's not my question. So you're included --if we go back to the --37 
21 A let me speak here because I understand what you're trying to 
22 say to me, okay? I'm not concerned with what --if he was recording for 3 hours, 4 
23 hours, I'm not concerned with the 3 hours and 57 minutes he was recording. When I 
24 was there, I saw nothing. If I felt in danger, I wouldn't have been there, okay? 
25 So, yeah, I'm telling you that when I was in that building, I did not feel unsafe. So  38 
1 I understand what you're trying to ask me, and the answer is no. 
No, no, no. My question is -- 2 
3 Q 
A You're trying to ask me if I felt --if I saw violence or if I felt unsafe. No, I did 
4 not. 
5 Q So actually I'm not --I'm not actually asking you if you felt unsafe. I'm 
6 asking you if you witnessed violence. 
7 A So you can go on Baked Alaska's stream --and I don't know who Baked 
8 Alaska is --
Mr. Gilsenan. Francis, Francis? 9 
10 The Reporter. Excuse me, excuse me. There's overlapping. We have to go 
11 one at a time, please. 
12 Mr. Gilsenan. Francis, if you could let 
13 then you speak. 
14 
15 Mr. Connor. That's fine. He did -­
Mr. Gilsenan. Go ask the question. just finish his question and 
16 I think he answered it is that he said his testimony was that he 
17 witnessed no violence. 
18 
19 
20 
21 Mr. Connor. Yeah. 
Mr. Gilsenan. Asked and answered, Counselor. 
BY-
Q Okay. So why don't you tell us what you did see while you were inside the 
22 Capitol? 
23 A I just saw a bunch of people walking around, people taking pictures of stuff, 
24 and I only stayed in there for about 9 minutes. Then I walked back to where I entered, 
25 and I asked the police --because the door that I entered, there was, like, a bunch of  39 
1 trafficking going back and forth, and couldn't --I couldn't get out. I wanted to leave. 
2 So I asked the officer, you know, How should I exit? And then there was a 
3 broken window that was broken already, and he said, You can go out of here if you want, 
4 which is --it wasn't like a drop. It was like a 2-, 3-foot drop. So I went out the window, 
5 and then we went --we left the building, and I kind of just looked at the crowd. We 
6 were on --we were, like, on an elevated thing, and we just looked at the crowd and saw 
7 how big it was. And then that's when I turned to my friends. I said, you know, Let's 
8 get out of here. Let's just go home, and we went home.  1 
2 [2:08 p.m.] 
3 BY-
4 
5 Q So what did you think about seeing a broken window in the Capitol? 
A I felt like, you know --I didn't like it. I mean, even when I was in there, 
6 after I saw the broken window, and then I saw like --there was like statutes of people. 40 
7 And I just saw like everyone in there. You know, I was just kind of like, why --like, why 
8 are they --why is the window broken on the Capitol Building. I felt, like, disrespected. 
9 Although, I was in there and I didn't do anything, you know, but towards our country, like, 
10 it --I looked at it as like a great, prestigious building for our country. You know, it's 
11 something we should be proud of that shouldn't be getting things broken or, you know, 
12 stuff like that. So I felt like personally, like, disrespected. 
13 
14 
15 
16 Q But didn't you go into a Senator's office while you were inside the Capitol? 
A Yeah. 
Q And you did rifle through some of his books, correct? 
A Yeah. But when I went into --it wasn't --I went down a hallway and there 
17 was an open door. There wasn't big, bold letters that said Senator's office. I went in 
18 to an open door in a random room. I didn't know it was a Senator's office. 
19 Q Office or not office, did you not think it would to be disrespectful to rifle 
20 through papers or books that are in there? 
21 A I was just looking at books on a bookshelf. I mean, I'm not breaking 
22 anything. 
23 
24 Q What made you want to look through them? 
A Because it was like I am in --I like --I like U.S. history. I was like, oh, I'm in 
25 the Capitol Building, like, this is cool. Like, I like this place. Let me just see, like, maybe  1 there's a cool book here or what could be here. Like, this is cool. Just looking out of 
2 boredom, curiosity, with no negative intent at all. 
3 
4 
5 
6 Q What were people --
Mr. Gilsenan. -could I ask Francis a quick question? 
Yeah. 
Mr. Gilsenan. Francis, if you had known it was Senator Merkley's office, would 
7 you have stayed in there or gone in there? 
8 
9 
10 
11 Mr. Connor. Not at all. 
Mr. Gilsenan. Thank you. 
BY-
Q Do you remember what people were saying around you while you were in 
12 that office? 41 
13 A Not really, no. It was just noisy. So many --there was so much noise that 
14 there was nothing specific that I could, you know, pick up. 
15 
16 Q 
A Do you remember anyone chanting at all inside the Capitol? 
No. Maybe --the only chant I heard that day was like, "stop the steal," 
17 which I wasn't partaking in that chant. You know, I don't --I don't --you know. That's 
18 probably the only --that's the only chant I heard that day. 
19 
20 Q 
A Did you hear it inside the Capitol? 
Yeah, throughout the hallways. Not like in a big grouped manner; just 
21 maybe like a handful of people, you know, saying that. 
22 
23 Q So what did you think those people hoped to do? 
A I don't know. I mean, honestly, I don't --I don't --I feel like those people 
24 were just kind of like just wasting their breath, you know. I don't know what they hoped 
25 to do. I felt like it was just a waste. I didn't know why, you know. Them saying that  42 
1 is not going to change, you know, reality, you know. That's what I believe. 
2 Q Well, the reality is that storming the Capitol did delay the certification of the 
3 vote. Were you aware of that while you were inside the building? 
4 
5 
6 A 
Q 
A No. After --when I was in there, it was already done, so -­
Did --
People went into the Capitol Building when I was at the Trump rally still. 
7 Those were people I was not --I'm not affiliated with those people. So by the time I was 
8 in there, everything was done. And I didn't storm anything. I walked. I walked 
9 through a door. 
10 Q Well, let's talk about why you decided to go in the building. Can you tell us 
11 why you did? 
12 A Because there was just a bunch of people walking in and out. And then 
13 there was no --there was no guards there saying, oh, don't come in here, you're doing 
14 something wrong. And right in front of the door, there was a bunch of Capitol Police. 
15 And they said, don't be violent, don't break anything and you're fine. 
16 
17 
18 I have a quick question. Sorry, sorry. Keep going. Sorry. 
Mr. Connor. That's all I got to say. 
You just said that you didn't storm, you just walked in. Do you 
19 understand that collectively with the number of people who went into the Capitol that 
20 day, that technically it is storming the Capitol? Would you agree with that? 
21 Mr. Connor. No. Storming is like storming the beaches in Normandy. That's 
22 storming. I walked into an open door, so, you know, come up. 
23 - Why'd you leave? 
24 Mr. Connor. Because it was pointless for me to be there. And then I --and 
25 then when I was outside --once I left, I went outside to whatever the --I guess there's the  43 
1 west wing, and I was like standing there looking at the thing. And then --or looking at 
2 the crowd. And then I heard someone say that the National Guard was coming. So 
3 then I told my friends, I said, let's just get out or here. There's no point of us being here, 
4 before, you know, whatever happens happens. I don't know. 
5 
6 
7 time? 
8 Q 
A BY 
You didn't see police inside the Capitol trying to get people out around this 
No. There was --like, there's pictures on the internet of like other --like, 
9 when I see pictures on the internet of January 6th and I see like inside the building, there 
10 was parts of the building, like, I didn't --I wasn't --I'm not familiar, I didn't go in there. 
11 went into like a certain area. 
12 And, like, the things that you see of --1 think there was --there's like one door --I 
13 forgot. Like, the people who went into like the Senate Chamber and the Congress or 
14 whatever, I wasn't near there. I believe that was like lower. That's like ground level. 
15 And then there was violence down there, what I saw on the internet. But I wasn't near 
16 there. 
17 Q So, look, we've looked at where you went in the Capitol. You came into the 
18 Senate wing door and you walked all the way towards the House Chamber. So 
19 technically, you literally walked from one end of the Capitol to the other end of the 
20 Capitol. 
21 A Yeah, but I was nowhere near --it was the pictures that I saw. I'm not 
22 familiar with where --wherever area those people were, and I wasn't there. I went 
23 down one hallway. 
24 Q So, I guess, you said you heard the National Guard was coming when you 
25 were outside the Capitol. What, I guess, forced you to leave the Capitol Building itself?  1 A When I heard the National Guard was coming, I was like, I don't --I'm not, 
2 you know, I'm not involved in anything like this. 
3 Q But you were outside --you were outside when you heard about the 
4 National Guard, right? 
5 
6 
7 
8 leave. 
9 
10 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Yeah. I was on --I was on like the west wing platform thing. 
Let me rephrase. Why did you leave inside the Capitol? 
Oh, because I just wanted --there was nothing going on. I just wanted to 
Were you tracking President Trump's tweets at all during this time? 
No. There was --I didn't even have --I didn't even have the internet that 44 
11 day. Even when I was at the rally at 6:00 in the morning, the internet was not working. 
12 There was too many people, I guess, or they have like scramblers or whatever. I didn't 
13 have internet. 
14 Q Do you recall anyone that you were around discussing President Trump's 
15 tweets while you were --
16 
17 
18 
19 A 
Q 
Q No. 
Okay. 
BY-
I'm a little bit confused about the internet point. So didn't you find out 
20 about people heading to the Capitol from friends while you were in the car? 
21 
22 
23 A 
Q 
A Yeah. 
So did you have internet at that point? 
Yeah. It was about like 3 miles away from where I was. We walked --like, 
24 it took --it took us a good half hour or maybe 40 minutes to get back to the car, because 
25 we were no --after --when I got internet, I was nowhere near rally.  45 
1 Q But you had internet at that point. So --and that was I think we 
2 established somewhere around 2 o'clock, maybe a little bit after. And as you correctly 
3 mentioned, people were already breaking through police barriers and heading to the 
4 Capitol while President Trump was still speaking. 
5 So if you found out that people were heading there, did you also check in with any 
6 news organizations or hear from any news organizations about people acting violently in 
7 heading towards the Capitol before you got there? 
8 A It was more of I maybe went on the trending page on Twitter. And then I 
9 saw kind of maybe --I guess it was like an aerial shot or whatever of just like what the 
10 building looked like, just like a ton of people there. Like, that's what I could remember. 
11 Q So you don't remember seeing short video clips or people's tweets about 
12 individuals were overrunning police and heading into the Capitol? 
13 
14 A 
Q No. 
And besides the broken window, did you see any other property damage 
15 while you were around the Capitol? 
16 
17 A 
Q Maybe like another --maybe just a couple more broken windows. 
Okay. And at the time, was it your impression that individuals who had 
18 entered the Capitol had broken the windows? 
19 A Well, I looked at the windows and I was like, how did they break the 
20 windows? You know, those windows are pretty strong, like, what were they throwing 
21 through them? These are things, like, I wasn't questioning in the moment. Like, I 
22 just --it was a broken window. 
23 Q And you didn't hear any chants either before you went in or while you were 
24 in or after you were in about, you know, hang Mike Pence, anything about Speaker Pelosi, 
25 anything about other Members of Congress?  1 
2 A 
Q No. 
All right. So I think we're going to talk about some messages that were in 
3 your statement of offense and --from that day and after. So on January 6th, I think 
4 about 10 p.m., you messaged your friends, Mr. Ferrigno and Mr. Lunyk, n-word's just 
5 getting fired tomorrow. 
6 And what did you mean by that? 
7 A What did I say? 
8 
9 
10 Q 
A 
Q You said, nigga's just getting fired tomorrow. 
Because we saw my friend on the Baked Alaska thing. 
Okay. So at that time, at 10 p.m. on January 6th, why did you think your 
11 friend was going to get fired? 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Because it was like trending on Twitter. 
Did you know that you guys weren't supposed to be in the Capitol? 
No. 
Then why did you think you would get fired? 
Because I just thought it was a bad representation of my friend. 
Can you explain why? 
Because he's trending on Twitter. It is not like a place if you --because it 
19 was being --on Twitter, it's perceived as a negative way. 
20 
21 
22 Q I mean, you could be trending on Twitter for a lot of reasons. 
But go ahead, 
I was going to say, you can be trending on Twitter for good 
23 reasons. You friend was trending because he was inside the Capitol. So is that why 
24 you thought people were going to get fired, because you were inside the Capitol? 46 
25 Mr. Connor. Well, I mean, and with my political views, it seems as if every time I  47 
1 go on the trending page on Twitter, it's totally negative, because, you know, Twitter's a 
2 one-sided thing. It's pretty obvious. But, yeah, I just thought it was not --it was not 
3 good being on Twitter like the way the news was perceiving that day. Like, obviously, 
4 it's not a good thing. 
5 I guess I have a question and --do you think it's unlawful to go 
6 into the Capitol, sitting here today? 
7 Mr. Gilsenan. I'm going to jump in. He pied guilty to it. He's admitted 
8 responsibility. 
9 And so I think he should be able to answer the question. 
10 Mr. Gilsenan. Yeah. I mean, I just --my thought is here, with all due respect, if 
11 you're not getting the answers you want from him, then why don't we wrap this up? 
12 It's not --I don't think it's getting the answers that we want. 
13 think he's saying --it's a pretty simple question. He said people were getting fired. 
14 We're asking him why you would get fired. And he's --
15 Mr. Gilsenan. He gave you a response. I mean, I don't know --it's clearly not 
16 the response you want. And with all due respect, Counsel, I just --we keep going over 
17 the same ground here and I don't know if it's worth your time even to continue this. 
18 Mr. Gilsen --and I'm sorry if I'm mispronouncing your last name, 
19 Mr. Gilsenan, but I think it's a pretty simple question to ask if he thinks going into the 
20 Capitol in 2022 was unlawful. I think that's a fair question. 
21 Mr. Gilsenan. And that's not a problem --a problematic question. I'm just --I 
22 don't want to speak over you --but if we're going to go over the same ground like this 
23 again and again, it seems frustrating to you and to-as well. I --but, Francis, go 
24 ahead and answer the question. 
25 Mr. Connor. Yeah, well, after my house got raided by the department of  1 counterterrorism and Secret Service, now I know I shouldn't be in there. But prior to 
2 that day, there was no barriers set up to where I thought that I was doing anything 
3 wrong. That's my answer. 
And I'm going to ask, it's a yes or no, sitting here today in July 2022 -­
That's my answer. 48 
4

9 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q --do you think it was unlawful to go into the Capitol on January 6th of 2021? 
I gave you my answer. 
10 
11 You did not answer that question, actually. 
Yeah, I did. Yeah, I did. 
I'm going to ask you one more time. Sitting here today in July of 2022, do 
12 you think it was unlawful to go into the Capitol on January 6th of 2021? 
13 A On January 6th of 2021, I was unaware that I was doing anything illegal. 
14 And if I was aware, I wouldn't have done it. After I got my front door kicked down with 
15 armed soldiers, now I think you know what that answer is. So you can just move on to 
16 the next question or, you know, we could end this. 
17 Q So your guilty plea that your counsel just referenced says, the defendant, 
18 who is you --
Mr. Gilsenan. Okay. 19 
20 
21 --willfully and knowingly entered --I'm just asking --
Mr. Gilsenan. we're going to stop it here. We're going to stop it 
22 here. You know, I --I don't want to lecture you two fine gentlemen. And I appreciate 
23 your referencing your work and the committee's work, but at the same time, trying to do 
24 what I think you're trying to do, it's a waste of your time, in my opinion, and it's a waste 
25 of ours. So I think at this point -- 49 
It was just a follow-up question. 1 
2 Mr. Gilsenan. I'm going to direct Mr. Connor not to answer any more questions. 
3 And I'm sorry this couldn't have been done in a different way where you may have gotten 
4 more fruitful answers, but I'm not asking the questions. So --
5 - Can I try and we can just move on? There aren't very many 
6 questions left. I promise. 
7 Mr. Gilsenan. I suppose, fellas. I don't want to be disrespectful and, you know, 
8 but where are we going? 
9 - I just want to go through the rest of the statement of offense and the 
10 rest of the messages that went in --
11 Mr. Gilsenan. I mean, he pied guilty. And, again, if it's just a rehashing of this, I 
12 don't see what information you're gathering from this beyond what was said in open 
13 court. 
14 That is your prerogative. That's your decision. We're going to 
15 ask follow-up questions, and if you don't want him to answer the follow-up questions, 
16 that is your choice. So you let us know how you want to proceed. 
17 Mr. Gilsenan. And, Mr. Connor, I'm advising you to terminate the interview.
