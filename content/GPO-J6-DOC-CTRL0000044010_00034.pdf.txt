Please see the attached memos and forms for Monday sent to me by Ken Chesebro in Wisconsin who is coordinating the 
six state strategy for Trump/Pence electors on Monday. 
Do not share this with anyone at this point -I've connected Jesse Binnall and Ken to discuss details, and wanted both of 
you to have this background info. It explains very clearly the process and the justification for our actions. 
I'm happy to field any questions on this or to give a brief overview to our meeting later today.

Wonderful to hear! 
Thank you for getting back to me so quickly, despite your hectic schedule . 
I spoke this evening with Mayor Guiliani, who is focused on doing everything possible to ensure that that all the Trump­
Pence electors vote on Dec. 14. He was glad to hear of your agreement with this strategy. 
As background , I attach my Nov. 18 memo explaining the upside of this strategy, and, my Dec. 9 memo on the logistics, 
including the issues raised by state-law provisions regarding the Electoral College. 
You'll note that page 4 of the Dec. 9 memo mentions a concern regarding Nevada law, about the role of the Secretary of 
State. It may well be that the electoral vote needs to proceed without the participation of the Secretary of State, on the 
view that these technical aspects of state law are unlikely to matter much in the end. 
Of more practical use, attached are drafts of the Certificate that might be used on Dec. 14, along with a form to use in 
filling vacancies, if any might arise. 
Also attached is a draft memo that could be mailed with the Certificates. 
In terms of logistics, what's key is for the electors to assemble at the appointed time, and each personally sign the six (6) 
duplicate originals, make a copy of one of them (to convert to a PDF to circulate), and enclose each of them in an internal 
envelope, which will be tightly sealed, and labeled outside something like: 
"ELECTORAL VOTES OF THE STATE OF NEVADA 
FOR PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES ." 
This is the envelope that will then be opened only by the President of the Senate on January 6. 
Then, the four mailing envelopes would be addressed with the addresses I've listed in the memo. 
Pretty simple! 
Note: the items I've listed on the memo as sent by Registered Mail need to be sent by REGISTERED (not certified) mail, 
which is required by the statute. Certified mail didn't exist in the 1940s when the relevant statute was enacted. The Bush 
team almost messed up on this in 2000!

Just left you a voice mail. I just got on a plane in Denver enroute to Baltimore; landing approx. 2200 hrs. In DC through 
Sunday morning. 
Nevada is on board, and would appreciate you forwarding me whatever documentation you have that can help us. 
Thank you!

I'm one of the lawyers handling the state-court litigation in Wisconsin, the first State which made definite 
plans to have our electors vote on Monday. 
Confidentially , so you can understand how we're messaging it, below is a draft press release by our lead 
lawyer in WI, which would be released only after we file papers in the WI Supreme Court (following an 
expected loss in the lower court), which we e>Cpect to do Saturday. 
I'd appreciate if you or someone else on your team could get in touch with me as soon as possible. I have 
two memos explaining the rationale for the electors voting on Monday (though you may already have 
those}, and I am preparing drafts of the documents that the electors in Nevada could sign to effect their 
votes, in case having drafts in hand would be of help. 
call or write anytime, night or day.

Proposed Jim Troupis Statement on Electors' Meeting 
As the legal proceedings arising from the November 3 presidential election continue to work their way 
through the Wisconsin court system, I have advised the Republican Party of Wisconsin to convene a 
separate Republican electors' meeting and have the Trump-Pence electors cast their votes at the 
Wisconsin State Capitol on December 14. 
Of course, there is precedent for such a meeting. Democrat electors pledged to John F. Kennedy 
convened in Hawaii in 1960, at the same time as Republicans, even though the Governor had certified 
Richard Nixon as the winner. In the end, the State's electoral votes were awarded to President Kennedy, 
even though he did not win the state until 11 days after his electors cast their votes. 
The legitimacy and good sense of two sets of electors meeting on December 14 to cast competing votes 
for President and Vice President, with the conflict to be later sorted out by the courts and Congress, was 
pointed out by prominent Democrat activists Larry Lessig and Van Jones in an essay published last month 
on CNN.com. 
Given that the results in Wisconsin are still in doubt, with legal arguments that have yet to be decided, 
just as the Democrat electors met in Hawaii in 1960 while awaiting a final resolution of that State's vote, 
so too the Republican electors should meet this year on December 14 as we await a final resolution in 
Wisconsin.
