Please see below. Statement on hold until further notice, pending Rudy's talk with the President. 
Additionally, I just got this inquiry from Bloomberg, in case you didn't see Stephen Miller on Fox this AM: 
"Stephen Miller said this morning on Fox that an "alternate slate of electors" will send results up to Congress. 
Trying to get more clarity. You all having your own electoral vote?"

Good evening, Mayor -as discussed, am bumping the draft 
statement to the top of your inbox. 
"On December 14th, the states of Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, 
Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Georgia are appointing Democrat electors 
to cast their votes for Bi den. Each one of these states has clearly 
demonstrable evidence of voter fraud significant enough to change the 
outcome of the election. 
* Pennsylvania counted more than 700,000 ballots illegally and in 
secret. 
* Georgia has video evidence of 30,000 illegal ballots cast after the 
observers were removed. 
* Michigan had over 500,000 ballots cast without observation and 
71% of Wayne County precincts could not reconcile their books. 
* Wisconsin has over 243,000 ballots cast by potential ineligible 
voters. 
* In Nevada, 40,000 people voted twice. 
* Arizona tallied more than 500,000 ballots without any observation. 
In addition to these basic violations of state law, the Dominion 
software and voting data shows mathematical impossibilities with 
spikes for Biden faster than the machines' ability to process. 
XXM-0019418  Each of these elections were fraudulent, and irredeemably 
compromised because of foul play. The only honest thing we can say 
about the elections in these states is that they are fraudulent. 
Our system requires the 50 states to participate in the Electoral College 
process to select our President. When at least six states intentionally 
break the rules, this impacts the outcome and every states' voters, and 
is a violation of the U.S. Constitution . 
Any statement signed by Democrat electors from these six states 
claiming that they are properly appointed to cast a vote for Biden in 
the Electoral College is a false statement and Congress should not 
accept them. -Trump Legal Team"
