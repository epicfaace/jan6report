Fwd: 11AM Call info 
FYI -the only three folks who called in to Rudy's 11am surrogate briefing this morning were me, Tim and Erin (full list of 
invitees below). 
Messaging from the Mayor was to call the Dems crooks and to go hard on Dominion/Smartmatic, bringing up Chavez 
and Maduro, and that we have the airplane receipts that the company owners flew to Venezuela in 2011, all of this to 
show how crooked the process was. Additionally, to hit the Dominion CEO is an Antifa donor as we continue to look for 
anomalous results. 
We got back to normal with the President's push to argue equal protection/ballot observers kept out, and that the 
remedy is to discard 632K votes in PA-all of these ballots are fraudulent because we couldn't observe them. 
FYI: The Mayor also said more lawsuits are coming next week that will seek to invalidate upwards of lM ballots.
