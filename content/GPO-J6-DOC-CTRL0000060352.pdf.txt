On November 25, we held a hearing in historic Gettysburg where hours of testimony were presented 
regarding violations of voting law in Pennsylvania. The purpose of the hearing was to find out what happened 
in Pennsylvania after being contacted by thousands of people from across the Commonwealth sharing stories of 
violations of election law related to the November 03, 2020 general election. The hearing demonstrated that 
there is rampant election fraud in Pennsylvania that must be investigated, remedied and rectified. 
We heard personal testimony from citizens who experienced violations of their rights. Expert witnesses 
additionally testified about statistical anomalies that occurred, which changed the outcome of the election. In 
one such spike, hundreds of thousands of votes were dumped in a processing facility with 570k of these going 
for former Vice President Biden, and a paltry 3,200 for President Trump (99.54% for Biden and 0.56% for 
Trump). 
Other irregularities included: 
• Mail-in ballots were not inspected by Republican representatives in areas of Philadelphia and 
Allegheny County 
• Montgomery County was never provided with guidelines from State Department Secretary about 
"curing" defective ballots 
• Spikes depict more ballots being processed during specific periods than voting machines are capable 
of tabulating 
• The Philadelphia Board of Elections processed hundreds of thousands of mail-in ballots with zero 
civilian oversight 
• Ballots were separated from envelopes in numerous precincts; a recount is useless because the votes 
cannot be verified  076P-R000003754_0002

• Observers were corralled behind fencing in Philadelphia, at least 10 feet away from processors; 
similarly, in Allegheny County, observers were placed at least 15 feet away 
• Mail-in ballots were already opened in portions of Allegheny County; no one observed the opening of 
these ballots 
• Illegal "pop-up" election sites developed, where voters would apply, received a ballot and voted 
• Forensic evidence in Delaware County has disappeared 
• A poll watcher with appropriate certificates and clearances was denied access 
• Little observation of ballots in Montgomery County, and no signature verification 
• A senior citizen voted for President Trump, but it was not displayed on receipt 
• Election workers illegally pre-canvassed ballots in Northampton County; no meaningful canvas 
observation was permitted 
Despite the evidence, our Governor and Secretary of State decline to investigate these serious 
allegations. It is appalling that elected officials and the mainstream media are refusing to acknowledge the 
material fact that there are rampant voting problems in our state and show little regard for the sanctity of the 
election. Every legal vote must count and any who cheat in an election must be held accountable. Our Republic 
cannot long endure without free and fair elections. 
The United States of America has spent millions of dollars and put her men and women in harm's way 
to oversee safer, more reliable and freer elections in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kosovo and Bosnia. Why is the very 
state where the Light of Liberty was lit in 1776 is unable or unwilling to have elections as free and safe as war 
torn Afghanistan? Something is seriously wrong in this Commonwealth and unless this is corrected, our 
republic cannot long endure. 
This election is an embarrassment to our nation. John Adams rightly said that, "Facts are stubborn 
things," and armed with this, as Jesus stated, "We shall know the truth and the truth shall set us free." What 
happened on November 3, 2020 must be immediately addressed using facts and the personal testimony of the 
good people of our state. 
Sincerely, 
\
