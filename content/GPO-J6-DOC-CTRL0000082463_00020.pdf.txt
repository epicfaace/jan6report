Subject: [EXTERNAL]Word documents for New Mexico electors 
Mike, 
Attached are the documents you requested. 
I added the new qualifiying language at the start of the Certificate. Might be good to have it 
added in all states. 
Main issue presented by New Mexico is that electors are supposed to meet inside the Secretary 
of State's office. See Document# 1. Perhaps, as in NV, not an essential requirement given the 
context.
