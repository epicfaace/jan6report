That's out of our control unfortunately . It largely depends on how quickly the WH moves. PPO, WHCO have to clear 
him and then OPM. I think PPO would work to expedite him though since they want him in soon. That's the best I can 
tell. I would say a week or so would be ideal.

Good morning, ladies. I just spoke with Ken he understands this position is a GS-15 level and while he was hoping 
for an increase, at least it is not a decrease. He accepts this and so we can move ahead as expeditiously as possible. Is 
there a possible timeframe for when he can expect to start? Please advise. 
Thank you for your assistance.

Through Claire Murray and Will Levi, I've gotten the go ahead to bring Ken aboard as a 
counsel, which Ken is good with. I will call Ken with the good news and I will ask my Chief 
of Staff Doug Smith to advance the paperwork on this. 
Doug, please handle.

Good afternoon, Jeff. 
I would like to recommend an outstanding candidate to you for the Civil Division as a DAG 
(possibly for Appellate) Ken Klukowski. Clare and I interviewed Ken this afternoon and 
believe he would make an excellent addition to your division. Ken is recommended to us 
from White House Presidential Personnel Office, as well as a longtime friend of mine who 
works in the Vice President's office. Ken's resume is attached. Ken tells us that he actually 
met you briefly in 2018 before he joined the Administration (you were in EN RD) and 
thought you may remember him. 
May I suggest that you arrange to meet with or talk with Ken to see for yourself if you 
HouseSelect-Jan6-Partll-12142021-000107 
Document ID: 0.7.7623.69729  think he would be a good fit in the Civil Division. I am happy to ask Clare to help facilitate if 
that works for you. Let me know. 
With warm regards,
