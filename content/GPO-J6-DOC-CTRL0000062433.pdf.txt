To further the mission of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the 
United States Capitol, we write to provide research prepared by Southern Poverty Law 
Center (SPLC) Intelligence Project experts. We strongly support the essential work of the 
Select Committee. The Committee's findings and recommendations will be critical for 
lawmakers and the public to help understand the architects behind the January 6 attack, 
how to hold those planners and perpetrators -and those who inspired them to action -
accountable, and necessary steps to safeguard future elections and our country's 
democratic institutions. We would ask that this statement be included as part of the Select 
Committee's official record. 
Established in 1971, SPLC has been relentless in identifying and rooting out extremist 
groups to create a fair, inclusive, and unified nation. We are a nonprofit advocacy 
organization serving as a catalyst for racial justice throughout the South. We work in 
partnership with communities of color to dismantle white supremacy, strengthen 
intersectional movements through transformative policies and initiatives, and advance 
human rights of all people. We have deep expertise in monitoring the activities of domestic 
hate groups and other extremists -including the Ku Klux Klan, the neo-Nazi 
movement, neo-Confederates, racist skinheads, antigovernment militias, and 
others. We currently track hundreds of extremist groups operating across the country 
and publish investigative reports, share key intelligence, and offer expert analysis to the 
media and public. 
Nick Fuentes and America First 
Only 22 years old when he cheered on Donald Trump supporters attacking the U.S. Capitol 
building on Jan. 6, 2021, white nationalist Nick Fuentes has emerged as one of the most 
influential figures in a growing movement to undercut America's fragile democracy and 
replace it with a hard-right, authoritarian system. SPLC formally listed Fuentes' America 
First as a hate group in 2021, but we have tracked his hateful activism for five years.1 
1 Southern Poverty Law Center, The Year in Hate and Extremism 2021, 
https://www.splcenter.org/20220309/year-hate-extremism-2021, March 9, 2022  Fuentes and his America First hangers-on succeed by making extremism seem normal to 
those who already espouse right-wing views. They collaborate with Republican lawmakers 
and bring them into the same room with hardened white supremacists. They put a youthful, 
conservative face on radical, far-right ideas, and do so while turning a profit. They eschew 
gloomy hate symbols, and instead embrace Americana and praise the fascist leaders 
America once fought to eradicate. 
Fuentes told SPLC through a lawyer that he abhors political violence, but the America First 
movement unabashedly supports the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection. Not only did Fuentes 
publicly raise the notion of killing disloyal Republican lawmakers in the run-up to the attack 
on the Capitol on Jan. 6, but he has also expressed no remorse for the deadly outcome of 
the day's events.2 He said of the attack on the Capitol on the eve of its first anniversary: 
"This is a holiday. This is a historic moment for us. We should celebrate that it happened, 
absolutely."3 Fuentes and his collaborators will seize another opportunity to promote political 
violence on the scale of the Capitol attack, or worse, if given a chance. 
Origins of Fuentes' America First movement 
Fuentes wins fans on the far right by speaking directly about his ambitions. He talks about 
further radicalizing the Republican Party and building an extremist movement to control our 
government. He describes his ambitions to protect America's "white demographic core," 
defining his movement explicitly along racial lines.4 
"We have got to be on the right, dragging these people kicking and screaming into the 
future .... Into a truly reactionary party. It's incremental. We're not going to drag them all the 
way over. But if we can drag the furthest part of the right further to the right, and we can 
drag the center further to the right, and we can drag the left further to the right ... then we're 
winning," Fuentes told his followers in May 2021 .5 
Fuentes' mostly young, white, and male followers refer to themselves as "groypers," which 
is the name of a toad-shaped cartoon character who commonly appears in internet memes.6 
People who call themselves groypers also identify as being America First, but this brand has 
no formal vetting process, membership structure or hierarchy. Fuentes calls his fans to 
events, and the young, mostly white, and almost exclusively male groypers appear. Fuentes 
made such calls in the run-up to Jan. 6, 2021, and groypers appeared at "Stop the Steal" 
events throughout the United States, waving flags bearing his America First logo. 
Fuentes also attracts other far-right influencers who seek access to this young fan base. 
Some of the influencers who appear alongside Fuentes are white nationalists, like Peter 
Brimelow of the racist non-profit VDARE. Others are people of color who work with white 
nationalists, like livestreamer Jesse Lee Peterson and Michelle "Mommy Groyper" Malkin.7 
On the day of the attack on the U.S. Capitol, far-right influencer and frequent Fuentes 
collaborator Timothy "Baked Alaska" Gionet entered the building and livestreamed to his 
own fans from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office.8

2  From white nationalist activism to AFPAC 
In 2017, Fuentes marched alongside Klansmen, neo-Nazis, skinheads, and other white 
power activists at the deadly "Unite the Right" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Three people 
were killed and dozens injured at the rally; yet, in social media posts and interviews with 
mainstream news outlets, Fuentes presented the event as a success. He claimed in a 
Facebook post that it would unleash a "tidal wave of white identity." 9 
Less than a year later, Fuentes addressed a crowd at the annual meeting of the self­
described "race realist" think tank American Renaissance, where he argued that his 
generation may provide a fruitful recruitment pool for the racist right. Kevin DeAnna, a 
propagandist and longtime member of the white power movement, stated that Fuentes was 
"the youngest person to ever speak at one of our conferences."10 
Fuentes used the popularity of his nightly video livestreams to push his audience toward 
real-world organizing in fall 2019, when the groypers disrupted a number of on-campus 
speaking events affiliated with the conservative youth group Turning Point USA (TPUSA). At 
events on the campuses of UCLA, Texas A&M University, Ohio University, and elsewhere, 
Fuentes fans tormented more mainstream right-wing speakers by asking them bigoted 
questions during live Q&A sessions. Fans of Fuentes' show referred to these incidents as 
the "Groyper Wars." In one post on Telegram from Nov. 10, 2019, authored in the run-up to 
an event with Donald Trump Jr. on the UCLA campus, Fuentes encouraged his supporters 
to ask questions that he claimed would show him to be a "radical globalist on immigration" 
or nod to the fact that TPUSA president Charlie Kirk did not support Trump in the 2016 
Republican primary.11 TPUSA has since taken a harder turn to the right, hiring 
disinformation operator and extremist Jack Posobiec in 2021.12 Kirk, too, has since called for 
a "citizen force" on the border in order to preserve "white demographics in America."13 
Malkin, an anti-immigrant pundit, helped lend support to Fuentes' movement in the 
aftermath of the confrontation with TPUSA.14 She spoke at Fuentes' inaugural America First 
Political Action Conference (AFPAC), alongside white nationalists Scott Greer and Patrick 
Casey.15 Fuentes scheduled AFPAC to coincide with the more mainstream Conservative 
Political Action Conference (CPAC) and has since made it an annual event. AFPAC has at 
times overshadowed CPAC because of the media interest generated by Republican 
lawmakers appearing side-by-side with white nationalists.16 Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona, 
who promoted the "Stop the Steal" campaign, spoke at AFPAC's second iteration. Rep.

Fuentes registered a 501(c)4 non-profit called the America First Foundation in July 2020.18 
Florida native Jozef Victor Nathan Gherman, who operated on line under various 
pseudonyms, helped Fuentes set up the foundation, SPLC found.19 Prior to his work with 
Fuentes, during parts of 2017 and 2018, Gherman ran a cryptocurrency "solicitation 
scheme." The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued an order in April 
2021, demanding Gherman pay restitution to investors who lost hundreds of thousands of 
dollars in cryptocurrency through his company.20 
Fuentes started promoting his non-profit as a place to make donations in the run-up to the 
second annual AFPAC conference. He boasted in a March 1, 2022, post on the messaging 
app Telegram that "we raised a shit load of money" for the foundation during the third 
annual AFPAC conference.21

4  Conservative aesthetics, neofascist ambitions 
Fuentes has said his goal is to "take over the conservative movement" and has called 
contemporary America "the great satan."22 He and his followers champion stringent anti­
LGBT laws, white identity politics, brutal nativism, and authoritarianism. Some give voice to 
Holocaust denialism or revisionism. Neo-Nazi Andrew Anglin of The Daily Stormer 
described Fuentes as the "future dictator of America" in a January 2022 post on his website, 
underscoring his appeal to other open admirers of fascism.23 
Despite this extremism, Fuentes and other America First activists still manage to build 
bridges with mainstream politicians. They do this by softening their aesthetic and avoiding 
the stereotypical trappings of white power activity. 24 America First collaborator Patrick Casey 
has called traditional white nationalism a "dead brand" and urged his fans to distance 
themselves from uniform-wearing or terroristic neo-Nazi groups. 
"Like it or not, when you define yourself as a white nationalist, you're linking yourself to the 
[white supremacist novel] Turner Diaries, [the neo-Nazi group] the Order, indefensible policy 
proposals, neo-Nazism, etc .... I really don't see how anyone can look at the political 
landscape and self-described white nationalists are ever going to take power. It's a dead 
brand," Casey posted to Telegram in October 2019.25 
Fuentes found middle ground between the white nationalist fringe and the mainstream 
Republican Party through public support of the populist presidency of Donald Trump. 
Throughout the Trump era, Fuentes and his cohorts exploited the 45th president's popularity 
with young conservatives to deepen support for his own livestreams and events. 
"I don't want to see anyone Roman saluting," Fuentes told his fans on a livestream during 
the summer of 2020, urging his followers to avoid being caught identifying publicly with 
Nazism while supporting Trump.26 "I want to so bad right now, though. I want to Roman 
salute my president so bad." 
Fuentes has praised Hitler, the Italian fascist Benito Mussolini, and the 2022 Russian 
invasion of Ukraine, while at the same time lifting up former President Trump as a heroic 
and noble figure.27 
America First and 'Stop the Steal' 
Fuentes and others in the America First tent hyped the "Stop the Steal" movement and gave 
the protest events surrounding Trump's lies an air of youthful enthusiasm. Former Trump 
adviser Roger Stone created "Stop the Steal" during the 2016 election and used it to cast

5  doubt on the integrity of U.S. elections.28 When Stone ally and notorious disinformation 
peddler, Ali Alexander, helped resurrect the saying to stir up widespread distrust in the 2020 
elections, he tapped into the energy of Fuentes and his followers to help.29 Fuentes obliged, 
using the opportunity to raise money for himself and build new fans. 
Fuentes used the video game livestreaming platform Olive during "Stop the Steal" and rose 
to become one of the top earners on the platform.30 Table 2 itemizes Fuentes' earnings in 
the pre-and post-election periods. 
Table 2. Summary of earnings on DLive for user nicholasjfuentes Apr. 16, 2020 -Jan. 19,

Maximum daily donations $4183.61 
Avg. daily donation $414.60 
Avg. daily donation, pre-election $325.79 
Avg daily donation, post-election $739.25 
SPLC found that prior to "Stop the Steal," during the time between April and October of 
2020, Fuentes earned around $326 per day through Olive. Following Trump's electoral loss 
in November 2020 and the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Fuentes nearly 
doubled that amount, pulling in roughly $740 per day from his livestreams.31 
SPLC found that the vast majority of Fuentes' highest-grossing donation dates 
corresponded with the period in which he helped lead the "Stop the Steal" movement. Table 
3 details the days in which viewers gave the most money to Fuentes on Olive. (For a full

As the table indicates, 14 of 20 dates correspond to activities happening around the 2020 
election or "Stop the Steal." Some notable highlights include: 
• Two of Fuentes' highest gross donation dates, Dec. 1 and Dec. 2, corresponded to a 
speaking engagement at a Nov. 30, 2020, "Stop the Steal" rally in Phoenix. Fuentes 
streamed the event on Dlive.32 He netted $2,938.05 and $3,645.45 on Dec. 1 and 2, 
2020, respectively. 
• Fuentes earned $1,512.81 on Nov. 16, 2020, two days after Trump supporters 
gathered in Washington, D.C. for their Million MAGA March.33 
• Fuentes recorded a monologue where he raised the specter of killing state 
lawmakers on one show, Jan. 5, 2021, in which he pulled in a total of $2,331.55.34 
• Fuentes brought in $2,843.29 on a stream that aired the day after the insurrection. 
Olive suspended him shortly thereafter, making it his final broadcast on the site. 
In December 2020, while Fuentes was building his audience through "Stop the Steal" 
promotions, French computer programmer Laurent Bachelier donated 13.5 Bitcoin to him, 
then valued at around $400,000 U.S.35 Bachelier, who also donated to the white nationalist 
non-profit VDARE and the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer, took an intentional drug 
overdose soon after. He allegedly suffered from deteriorating health conditions. Fuentes is 
an avid proponent of cryptocurrency, dealing in Bitcoin and Litecoin, as SPLC reported.36 He 
has made cryptocurrency a big part of his business practices, which have received greater 
scrutiny following the attack on the Capitol.37

7  Evolution of livestreaming and life after 'Stop the Steal' 
Fuentes built his celebrity through his one-man livestreams, in which he speaks alone in 
front of a green screen backdrop.38 Fuentes started livestreaming as a first-year student at 
Boston University in 2017. His work aired on the Trump-aligned Right Side Broadcasting 
Network until that August. He subsequently attempted to move his stream to other 
livestreaming platforms, including mainstream platform YouTube and video game-focused 
Twitch, but these sites also banned him. He began streaming on the small Olive platform in 
early 2020 and remained there until they also suspended Fuentes on Jan. 9, 2021, following 
the attack on the Capitol. In February 2021, he launched an independent streaming service 
initially called America First.live and then later re-launched in October 2021 as Cozy.TV. 39 
Fuentes launched Cozy.TV through the help of white supremacist activists, as SPLC's 
Hatewatch reported in November 2021.40 
Fuentes has welcomed a wealth of far-right extremist content creators to Cozy.TV, including 
Andrew Torba, CEO of the extremist-friendly social media site Gab41; Milo Yiannopoulos, a 
former Breitbart staffer and alt-right apologist;42 Gionet, the white nationalist livestreamer 
who faces federal charges over his alleged breach of the Capitol on Jan. 6;43 and Daryush 
"Roosh" Valizadeh, a male supremacist who claims to have renounced his ways in favor of 
traditionalist Christianity.44 lnfowars' Alex Jones, who has expressed admiration for Fuentes, 
also mirrors broadcasts of his show on Cozy.TV. Because taking monetary donations is a 
key purpose of the video livestreams, Fuentes also installed a homebrew version of 
YouTube's "superchat" donation function on Cozy.TV using the Canada-based monetization 
platform Entropy. SPLC reported that when Fuentes announced that Entropy's payment 
processor "forced them to ban [him]," its parent company built him a custom-made platform 
to monetize his livestreams, helping to keep him afloat.45 
Fuentes had boasted that his verified Twitter handle helped drive traffic to his livestreams 
after losing access to one site or another, but the company suspended him in July 2021, 
following an SPLC investigation into the platform's role in buoying the far right.46 Relegated

his fanbase, such as Proud Boys founder Gavin Mclnnes.47 
Fuentes has also sought to exploit divides over the response to the COVID-19 pandemic by 
hosting two "Vax Watch" events in New York City in November 2021. There, he used the 
COVID-19 vaccine debate as a way into promoting his hard-right, authoritarian worldview, 
as well as Christian nationalist politics.48 Fuentes has also increasingly expressed paranoia 
and displeasure following the scrutiny he has faced after Jan. 6, 2021. 
"We have to do what we have to do," he said of his activism during a February 2022 
livestream. "I don't think I'll ever be happy. I enjoy what I do. It fulfills me. I'm content. But 
I'm never going to have the things that will make me happy because this is very tough. It's 
just a tough, grueling, miserable deal."49 
The Southern Poverty Law Center deeply appreciates the work of the Select Committee and 
we are a willing partner in your essential assignment. We look forward to continuing to work 
with you as you focus your urgent attention on investigating the deadly January 6 attack on 
the U.S. Capitol, establishing and reporting facts, and holding those responsible 
accountable.
