On Wednesday January 6th at approximately 0859 hours, I, Officer. of the United States Park Police was in the area of 
the Washington Monument attempting to enforce 36 CFR 1.5, a Superintendents Record of Determination Dated January 5, 
2020, that established a closure of the paved plaza and flag circle surrounding the Washington Monument. The area was 
only accessible to ticket holders touring the Washington Monument. The flag circle of the Washington Monument was 
surrounded with bike rack and had openings in the north walkways to allow people to leave the area. The Washington 
Monument was scheduled to open at 0900 hours. 
During my time clearing the area, I instructed people who were occupying the closed area within the flag circle to walk 
north out of the flag circle. In the Northwest Corner of the flag circle I was met with resistance from a crowd or 
approximately 20 people. Individuals yelled, "we pay taxes here, we are not leaving" and "this is our monument" I 
continued to make announcements that the area was closed and asked everyone to walk north. Much of the crowd was 
compliant and was proceeding to leave the area. I requested additional USPP officers to the area to assist with clearing the 
crowd and maintain the closure. 
I continued to plead with the crowd to leave the area. I observed a white male with a tan jacket and blue jeans, later 
identified as MCBETH, Evan, inside the closed area. I then watched MCBETH open a closed section of bike rack. MCBETH 
said something to the effect of "this area is open for all." When I saw MCBETH break the bike rack and police line, I 
attempted to detain him in an effort to escort him from the area. MCBETH turned towards me and I attempted to grab his 
left wrist. MCBETH pulled his wrist away from me, put his hands in the air and walked backward creating distance between 
us. I attempted to grab MCBETH's wrist again and he pulled away again. I then grabbed MCBETH around his stomach and 
forced him to the ground. Once MCBETH was on the ground I was able to secure him in handcuffs. 
After MCBETH was placed in handcuffs, a crowd of approximately 100 people started to form around him. MCBETHS actions 
encited the crowd to enter the closed area and threaten law enforcment. Due to the hostility of the crowd, USPP retreated 
back into the Washington Monument with MCBETH in custody. The crowd was hostile, threatening officers, and punching 
the glass windows of the Washington Monument Visitor Center. With the assistance of a horse mounted police escort 
MCBETH was placed into a USPP marked patrol wagon and transported to District 1 for processing. MCBETH was cited for 
36 CFR 1.5 (a) for a closure violation and released on his own recognizance.
