I will review now. I didn't send John edits, I explained that I was concerned about the President signing 
a verification about facts that may not be sustainable upon detailed scrutiny. I think that we should 
limit specific factual "number" allegations to those that are necessary i.e., those allegations that 
demonstrate that the decision is outcome determinative.
