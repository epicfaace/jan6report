2 - Good afternoon. This is the transcribed interview of Ms. Arina 
3 Grossu conducted by the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack 
4 on the U.S. Capitol pursuant to House Resolution 503. 
5 Ms. Grossu, can you please state your full name and spell it for the record?

10 
11 Grossu. Ms. Grossu. Arina Grossu, A-r-i-n-a, last name, G-r-o-s-s-u. 
Excellent. Thank you. 
I see that you also have counsel present with you on the call today. 
At this time, could counsel please state their name for the record. 
Mr. Brothers. Paul Brothers and Eddie Greim of Graves Garrett LLC for Ms. 
12 - Thankyou. 3 
13 This will be a staff-led interview, although members may, of course, choose to ask 
14 questions as well, although I'll note that there are not currently any members of the 
15 select committee in attendance. 
16 
17 
18 My name is investigative counsel. I'll be the primary interviewer 
today. Also in the interview today are 
_, professional staff member, and investigative counsel, -
chief clerk. 
19 I will announce any additional participants as they join, although there's no one 
20 else right now. 
21 I would like to note for the record that Ms. Grossu is appearing today voluntarily 
22 for her interview with the select committee. 
23 Is that correct, Ms. Grossu? 
24 Ms. Grossu. Yes. 
25 - I'd also like to note for the record that what has previously been  4 
1 marked as exhibit 1 is the subpoena that had been issued for Ms. Grossu dated March 
2 23rd, 2022, and just want to note that the select committee reserves the right to enforce 
3 the subpoena should you choose not to cooperate. 
4 Could we please pull up exhibit 1? 
5 While we wait for --there we go. Could you just take a look and confirm that 
6 that's the subpoena that was sent to you? 
7 You can scroll down 
8 Ms. Grossu. Yes. 
9 - Thank you. 
10 And you understand the select committee reserves its right to enforce the 
11 subpoena if you do not cooperate today? 
12 Ms. Grossu. Yes. 
13 - We, of course, don't expect that will be an issue and hope it's not a 
14 problem, and we thank you for your efforts to comply with the select committee's 
15 subpoena so far, including two productions that you've given to us. 
16 Because this proceeding is not being conducted as a deposition pursuant to a 
17 subpoena, you will not be formally sworn in. However, because this is a formal select 
18 committee investigation, you are obligated under Federal law to tell the truth same as if 
19 you were speaking with the FBI or the DOJ. It is unlawful to deliberately provide false 
20 information to Congress. 
21 As we remind all witnesses, providing false information during the interview could 
22 result in criminal penalties of perjury and/or false statements. 
23 Do you understand all of that? 
24 Ms. Grossu. Yes. 
25 - Thanks.  5 
1 There are official reporters transcribing the record of this interview. Please wait 
2 until each question is completed before you begin your response and we'll try to wait 
3 until your response is complete before we ask our next question, because it's very 
4 difficult for the stenographer to capture crosstalk. 
5 The stenographer also can't record nonverbal responses like head shakes or nods. 
6 So if you do that, I might prompt you to give a verbal response and it's important that you 
7 answer each question with an audible response. 
8 There's a camera recording the interview today as well, but the reporters' 
9 transcript is the official record of our meeting today. You and your counsel will have the 
10 opportunity to review the transcript if you would like. 
11 For the benefit of the reporter and the record, there may be times when I clarify 
12 what you said, as I just mentioned, including the spelling of a name or a word for our 
13 records. 
14 We ask that you provide complete answers based on your best recollection. If a 
15 question's not clear, please ask me to clarify. If you don't know the answer, simply say 
16 so. 
17 Throughout the interview, we'll be directing you to a few exhibits that we have 
18 marked for today. These were also electronically sent over to you and your counsel 
19 yesterday. 
20 When we refer to a document, if you would take time to familiarize yourself with 
21 it before we discuss it. And will also be putting it up on the screen so we 
22 can scroll through together to the relevant portions. 
23 Do you understand all of that? 
24 
25 Ms. Grossu. I do. 
- Thank you. And, logistically, please let us know if you need any  1 breaks. 
Ms. Grossu. Okay. 2 
3 - If you'd like to speak privately with your attorneys at any point, as I 
4 said earlier, we can go on break and go on mute to give you the opportunity. And as I 
5 said, about every hour or so, we'll try to take a break, although we will also balance that 
6 with the need to get this done quickly. 
7 Does that all sound good to you? 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 Ms. Grossu. Yes. 
- Great. So then we can get started.

Q No. 
How about any other kind of law enforcement? Police?

A 
Q

At the end of January 2021. 
What were your general responsibilities in this role? 
Writing press releases, helping with messaging documents, especially 8 
5 public-facing documents. 
6 Q Great. Thank you. 
7 And the last note on employment history. Can you give me a sense of your 
8 general employment history for the decade or so before your employment with HHS? 
9 A Sure. I worked at a PR firm and --CRC Public Relations. Again, doing PR 
10 work. I worked at Family Research Council as a spokeswoman on life and human dignity 
11 issues. I helped to start a nonprofit for clergy on biblical scripture. I worked at a 
12 school as a Montessori teacher, at a Catholic classical school. 
13 
14 
15 Let's see, yeah, if I remember everything. And HHS and now my own company. 
Q That's very varied and helpful context. 
So I think that's all I had on background questions. We could kind of move now 
16 more closely to what we're here to talk about today. And I'm just going to start with a 
17 few questions about background on the Jericho March. And if you sense me skipping 
18 ahead at any point and you want to go back and clarify things, feel free to jump in and do 
19 so. 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 So first question. Are you familiar with the Jericho March organization? 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A You mean the one that I started with my cofounder? 
Yeah. 
Yeah. Yeah. 
You anticipated it. What was your role in the organization? 
I was one of the cofounders.  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A And who was the other cofounder? 
Rob Weaver. 
When did you hold this role? 
When did I what? 
Hold this role. 
Well, we started it in early November, so obviously it was starting from 
7 scratch, so we just formulated titles as we went and all of that. But beginning talks of it 
8 were in early November --
9 
10 
11 
12 Q 
A 
Q 
A And this is November of 2020? 
Of 2020, yes. 
Great. Thank you. And when did the organization cease operations? 
So we stopped doing any marches, really, after the January 6th situation 
13 because we were afraid for the safety of marchers. So we didn't want to do any more. 
14 So we actually alerted them to not go on any marches for their own safety. 
15 Q That's helpful. So I know I keep saying organization, but I want to get a 
16 better sense of what the Jericho March actually was. 
17 Was it ever incorporated as an organization? 
18 A We were in the process of doing that, but I don't know exactly where it was 
19 in the process. So we were looking to incorporate as a 501{c)(3). 
20 Q Okay. But to your knowledge, it had never been completed before you 
21 stopped engaging with it after January 6th? 
22 A To my knowledge, right. 
23 
24 Q Okay. Thank you. 
You mentioned that you and Mr. Weaver were the cofounders. What was the 
25 general leadership structure of the organization beyond that? 9  10 
1 A We just brought on different contractors to help with various parts, whether 
2 it was the event planning part or graphic design or web person. So it wasn't, I guess, a 
3 formal structure. 
4 
5 Q 
A Okay. 
Beyond that, there was Jill Noble, she was a national coordinator. But 
6 other than that it wasn't really official in any other capacity, to my knowledge. 
7 Q So these contractors were for things like graphics you said. Any other 
8 purpose? Security contractors? 
9 A So, for example, for the December 12th event, we hired an event person to 
10 kind of handle the logistics and all of that. 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q And who was that person? 
Stephen Brown. 
With Resource Media? 
Yeah. 
Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. 
I wanted to go back just a little bit. 
You and Mr. Weaver cofounded the group in early November. Do you have a 
18 specific date that you can recall founding it? 
19 A 
20 exactly. 
21 
22 
23 
24 Q 
A 
Q 
A Early November, maybe a day or two after the election. I don't recall 
Did you have a previous relationship with Mr. Weaver? 
No. I never knew him before, no. 
How did you get connected with him? 
So after the election and just with concerns about irregularities, I felt called 
25 to have a prayer response, which is just --and so I wanted to see if anyone was handling  11 
1 that part of things. I know there was a legal response. There was a response on 
2 various fronts. But my concern was, is anyone praying about this? And couldn't 
3 find --there weren't any groups praying about it. Called around to see. And then Rob, 
4 independent of myself, also felt like there needed to be a prayer response to this. 
5 So he called around and we got connected. As I said, I didn't know him before, 
6 but ended up realizing that we were being called to a similar aspect of it, which was the 
7 spiritual aspect of it. 
8 Q Understood. Do you remember who connected you both, how you learned 
9 he was also interested in a prayer response? 
10 
11 
12 A 
Q 
A Through --I think it was through our mutual contact Catharine O'Neill. 
Okay. Who is she? 
At the time I believe her role was Catholics for Trump, but she's a friend of 
13 mine. So knowing that she was involved, I was wondering if there was any prayer 
14 response, and she didn't know of any. 
15 Q That's helpful. 
16 So you said a little bit about this already, but if I could ask more generally about 
17 your hopes for the organization when you and Mr. Weaver began it in the week after the 
18 election. Could you walk me through that a little bit more? 
19 A Can you repeat that? 
20 Q Sure. Can you walk me through a little bit more of your hopes for the 
21 organization? 
22 
23 A Oh, hopes. Okay. Sure. Of course. 
So we just wanted to pray for election integrity, transparency, form. We just 
24 wanted to, again, handle the spiritual aspect of things, which is people just felt there's 
25 nothing --you know, that everything around them they didn't know exactly what was  12 
1 going on. The one thing that people could do was just pray together. 
2 And so the hope of it was that people would exercise their First Amendment rights 
3 together and come together and pray. 
4 So now in terms of Jericho March and Jericho Walks --so I'm Catholic, Rob is an 
5 evangelical. Jericho Walks or Jericho Marches are something that is big in the 
6 evangelical community. They have been done for a while and they're always prayerful, 
7 peaceful. It's just praying for whatever issue, whether it's for the church or for et 
8 cetera. 
9 So somehow the idea of let's just pray together and do these Jericho Walks 
10 together came to be. And even when we were initially talking, people were already 
11 gathering at different places. I don't remember which of the State capitals, but even 
12 before we even started people were gathering to pray. So it was just kind of organic in 
13 that way. 
14 Q Thank you. That's helpful. 
15 Can you take a step back and help me understand what the term "Jericho March" 
16 means? 
17 A Uh-huh. Yeah. So it's based on Joshua 6 and the story of Joshua with 
18 Jericho, outside of Jericho, and they marched around seven times and the walls came 
19 down. 
20 Now, with the Jericho Walks that are traditionally done by evangelicals, usually it's 
21 again praying for whatever is their intention, for that thing to get passed. And so for our 
22 purpose, our intention was and what we pray for is for transparency, election 
23 transparency, et cetera. 
24 So we just wanted the truth, truth and justice to come out, whatever that may be. 
25 So if it's for us as the praying component, if it was that the votes came out and were  13 
1 audited and came out that Biden was the rightful winner of this election, that is what we 
2 wanted. We wanted the truth and justice of the election to come out. So if it was that 
3 it was President Trump, then we wanted that truth to come out. 
4 So it was really just praying for election integrity because that is an important 
5 aspect. And that's why even in the materials from early on, it was peaceful, prayerful, 
6 and for election integrity. So that we just wanted to make sure that that was what the 
7 justice that was to be done. We wanted it to be that it was --that what had occurred 
8 was the right outcome. 
9 Q That's good context for, I think, all of us to ground some of the questions 
10 that I have and that others may have, too. 
11 And want to flag, of course, that our mandate under the House is to look into all 
12 the circumstances that led to the attack on the 6th, and that obviously involves lots of 
13 events and planning that traced for weeks prior. And I think it's helpful for you to 
14 explain at the outset what your goals were as another organization that was seeking 
15 election integrity. So --
16 
17 
18 A 
Q 
A May I also add that we -­
Sure. 
--that we encouraged people to peacefully pray and also to fast, because it 
19 is a spiritual thing. And so from the very beginning it was on a spiritual realm. And the 
20 people who participated, it's family friendly, brought their little children with them, and 
21 prayed in their own prayer background. 
22 So you had Catholics praying the rosary, you had Jewish people praying their 
23 prayers, you had evangelicals praying their prayers. And so it was also basically the free 
24 exercise of religion and to pray for our Nation united in this way. 
25 Q Understood. When you first started to think about these events with Mr.  14 
1 Weaver in early November, were there any particular events you had in mind that you 
2 were planning? 
3 A So we discussed having prayer --so having Jericho Marches at the State 
4 capitals in swing States, especially because those were grounds where there was a lot of 
5 tension and controversy in terms of the question about the election integrity was 
6 especially focused on the swing States. 
7 So from the beginning the fliers just said every day at noon local time, the capitol 
8 buildings in the swing States. But people started actually doing that even locally at their 
9 courthouses. People were starting to pray even around their own homes, walking 
10 around their own homes praying. 
11 So it was just a very organic thing that people wanted to participate in because 
12 they felt they could do something by praying. 
13 Q So you would say that the decision to focus on some of the State capitals 
14 was made in the days after you first formulated the Jericho March organization? 
15 A I would have to look back at those emails of when in terms of the time line, 
16 but I think you could see just from the fliers that the focus was on the swing States at 
17 first. 
18 Q Uh-huh. That's helpful. 
19 , if we could pull up exhibit 2 and do a test run for if this is going to 
20 work smoothly. 
21 Great. Thank you. 
22 
23 On my part, not on-'s. Not on 
So this is an email. I see that --if we could zoom in possibly, you should be able 
24 to zoom in on your computer, too, Ms. Grossu --
25 A Okay.  15 
1 Q --that the sender of this email has been redacted in your production. Are 
2 you able to tell us who sent that? 
3 
4 
5 A 
Q 
A I don't recall who this is. 
That's all right. Do you recall this email? 
I mean, honestly, I've just been --there's a lot of emails that I've been going 
6 through, so I don't --
7 Q Understood. Well, this email on November 8th, so a couple of days after 
8 the election, the day after the election was called, and this email was sent to you all 
9 talking about swing State activity, as you mentioned, and also a huge march in D.C. on 
10 December 12th. 
11 So at that point had you already settled on a December 12th march? 
12 A I'm not sure of the timeline and I'm not sure where this email falls in that. 
13 There was --so I don't think we settled on it. Maybe that was the first --I'm not sure 
14 exactly if that was a first suggestion of it or not. We were, of course, just looking ahead, 
15 wanting people to pray every day. Of course, December 14th was a big date. 
16 Q And why was December 14th a big day? 
17 A That was when the certification --not the certification --the vote, the 
18 December 14th vote. 
19 
20 
21 Q 
A 
Q The electoral college vote? 
Yes. 
Understood. So later in this email there's a line at end of the first 
22 paragraph that says that they will flood D.C. with millions on the 12th, 
23 quote/unquote --I'm assuming it's a typo --even put fear into the left. 
24 
25 A 
Q Uh-huh. 
So I'm curious, how did you take that statement when you read this email?  1 A I mean, I think it was --I mean, I actually --I don't know. This is not from 
2 me or anything, so I can't --I don't know what the intent of the writer was. So I don't 
3 want to say what the intent of the person was in saying that. 
4 But it was certainly, I could say, just the people that we worked with in planning 
5 were all --were peaceful, faithful people. So I can say that the intent was nothing of 
6 that sort. 
7 From the very beginning we promoted in all of our promotional materials on the 
8 website that we are a peaceful, prayerful march, and that's what we did from the very 
9 beginning to the very end. And so I can't say what this person meant by that. 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q So "putting fear into the left" wouldn't have meshed with your goals -­
Right. 
--for the 12th? 
Right. Exactly. 
Understood. 16 
15 So you mentioned other groups that you were working with, and I wanted to ask a 
16 few more questions about that? 
17 And, we can take the exhibit down whenever you have a moment. 
18 Thank you. 
19 Was it your expectation that you'd be coordinating with other groups in advance 
20 of these events? 
21 A Not at first. That was not my expectation. Things just, I think, also 
22 organically happened. As you could see, I mean, our first flier was just us. There was 
23 no --it wasn't a coordinated effort; it was just we're doing the prayer marches and that 
24 was it. 
25 Q Uh-huh. And we'll get to more of that later. But initially it was not your  17 
1 intention to work with these other groups? 
Right. Right. 2 
3 A 
Q Did you ever have an expectation that you'd be speaking with people within 
4 the Federal Government? 
5 A Not --I mean, not myself. I wasn't really connected with a lot of people in 
6 Federal Government. I think the expectation was that we were just going to focus on 
7 planning our prayer marches and that's it. I mean, I was really just focused on trying to 
8 do that. 
9 Q And one more question on that. Did you ever work with anyone else who 
10 had a position in the Federal Government when you were planning these marches? 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q I mean, besides --so Rob --besides Rob? 
Did Mr. Weaver have a position in the government as well? 
He did. I don't know exactly what his title was or anything. 
Thank you. But besides the two of you, you weren't aware of anyone else? 
Not that I can recall at the moment. 
Thank you. 
17 I just have a few more general questions on the genesis of the Jericho March 
18 before we move on. 
19 You mentioned seeking to bring a spiritual aspect to the opposition or protests of 
20 alleged fraud or allegations of fraud in the election. Why did you think it was necessary 
21 to call out the allegations of fraud? 
22 A So I'll say this. At the time, obviously, everyone was --there was a lot of 
23 chatter on media, on the mainstream media about if there were irregularities, and we 
24 saw the middle of the night jumps in votes, et cetera. 
25 And so I think there's a question for the American public about, well, we would  18 
1 just want to know what happened and we just pray for transparency and that every valid 
2 vote is counted. 
3 And so it was not necessarily --again, as I mentioned, it was that the truth be 
4 revealed. That we just want to know can we just --we just want to know what's --what 
5 has taken place here. I don't know about you, but when I went to bed that night it was 
6 one thing and then the next morning was another thing, and I think just the general 
7 public had questions. 
8 And so I think it's just a matter of wanting the truth to come out and praying for 
9 that. 
10 Q Understood. Were there particular places where you thought that the 
11 fraud was concentrated? You mentioned some of the swing States earlier and there 
12 being tension there. 
13 Mr. Greim. I just --I don't --I know we're not really objecting here, but I don't 
14 think the witness has said that she thought there was fraud. I think --I don't think 
15 she --your question kind of assumes that-. So I wonder if you want to rephrase 
16 that. 
17 
18 
19 - Sure. I can rephrase that. 
BY-
Q Were there places where you thought that transparency was especially 
20 needed to understand what had happened? 
21 A Yeah. I would say --I think --I don't know if it was Wisconsin or where 
22 there was 138,000 extra votes over an hour or something, and then Georgia with the pipe 
23 leak and the footage that came out of Georgia with the packages. 
24 So I think it was just wanting to know what happened. And in the general 
25 question of the places that said they're going to stop counting for the night, I don't recall  19 
1 that happening in the past. 
2 So there were just questions about why did this happen in so many different 
3 States. We just want to know what's going on. 
4 Q Understood. And the mention of different States brings me to another 
5 question. Did you ever have partners with other organizations at the State level or was 
6 it all sort of a central hub of Jericho March organizers? 
7 A So for the State marches, we were trying to locate faith leaders who wanted 
8 to bring out some of their church members. And so it was just a very loose --there 
9 weren't people that --it was just a loose coalition of people of faith and just trying to 
10 locate those people who desired to also bring out people from their parish as well. 
11 Q Understood. And was there any other coordination or communication with 
12 State or Federal --sorry --State officials or local officials who were involved in the 
13 election certification process or State legislators, things of that nature? 
14 A Not to my knowledge for the coordination. December 12th --so while 
15 there was the national event happening in the swing States, they had little local events in 
16 front of their State capitals. Again, just like our December 12th event in the Capitol and 
17 all at the State capitals, they were peaceful, prayerful as it had been from day one. 
18 For speakers there the local leaders could ask maybe some of their local 
19 representatives, as well as faith leaders and local praise and worship musician leaders to 
20 come. 
21 So I can't speak to each of the different States, but just different speakers at 
22 different States. 
23 Q That's good. So I think at this point I'm going to move on and ask a few 
24 questions about use of social media and finances, and then we'll move more towards 
25 some of the December 12th and then January 6th conversation.  1 
2 20 
A Okay. 
Q Great. So which apps did you use to communicate with your Jericho March 
3 followers? 
4 A Let me see if I remember them all. So Jericho March had a Twitter account, 
5 Facebook, lnstagram, Parler. 
6 
7 
8 
9 Q I can run through some more if that will be helpful. 
A Sorry? 
Q I can run through some more if that would be helpful. 
A Sure. Yeah. Maybe I could just look, too. I don't remember other ones. 
10 I know we sent newsletters through Constant Contact. 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 Q Okay. That's helpful. 
So, I take it, email was a primary method of communication? 
A Yes. 
Q How about text messages? 
A Yes. For logistics, yeah. 
Q Okay. And you mentioned Facebook. 
A Uh-huh. 
Q Twitter you mentioned. How about Telegram? 
A Telegram? I don't recall. I don't recall. 
Q Okay. Signal? 
A I also don't recall. I don't recall. 
Q How about Gab? 
A What is it? 
Q Gab, G-a-b? 
A Yeah, I don't recall that one.  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Okay. You said Parler. How about Zella? 
What is that one? 
Zella? It's like a walkie-talkie app. Z-e-1-1-o. 
That doesn't even sound familiar. 
Okay. What about Reddit? 
I don't --not that I'm aware of. 
Okay. TheDonald.win? 
That does not sound familiar. 
How about 4chan? 
That doesn't sound familiar. 
Last one. 8kun? 
That also doesn't sound familiar. 21 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 Q Okay. Did you use any of those platforms personally, 8kun, TheDonald.win, 
Parler? 
A 
really --
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Parler, I think at some point I created an account, but I didn't --I don't 
Okay. What would you say was your main source of social media? 
My personal or the Jericho March? 
Personal. 
Face book. 
Thank you. Thank you. 
22 And turning to finances, who was responsible for the financial goings-on of the 
23 Jericho March organization? 
24 
25 A What do you mean by "the financial goings-on"? 
Q Were there designated treasurers or accounts for the organization?  22 
1 A So because we were just setting up the 501{c)(3), the fiscal --I guess the 
2 fiscal sponsor was Eagle Forum and Ed Martin. 
3 Q Okay. And so that was set up at some point after your initial conversation 
4 with Mr. Weaver, you received sponsorship from the Eagle Forum? 
5 A So in terms of the finances, it --there was no --we didn't have a bank 
6 account or anything. So it was just getting started from scratch. So it was just the 
7 Eagle Forum was the fiscal sponsor. 
8 Q So were you actively raising money throughout this time period, November 
9 to January? 
10 A So there were online donation buttons and things like that, and --I mean, for 
11 example, I think I reached out to a few people, but I wasn't successful or anything, just to, 
12 like, some of my faith contacts. 
13 But most of the money in terms of --I don't really know exactly how, especially 
14 the bigger donations, where they came from. 
15 Q And when you did receive donations, since you didn't have a bank account, 
16 where were they going? 
17 
18 A 
Q 
19 nature? 
20 
21 A 
Q They were going to an Eagle Forum bank account. 
Okay. And that was used for coordination of events and things of that 
Yes. Yeah. 
And what about merchandise? Was there merchandise that was sold to 
22 raise money? 
23 A There was --oh, we had a tee spraying, I think, in preparation for the 
24 December 12th event, and just tee shirts, et cetera. 
25 Q And last question on this. Did you or anyone else associated with the  23 
1 Jericho March ever use cryptocurrency? 
2 
3 
4 A 
Q Not that I'm aware of. 
Okay. Thank you. 
At this point, I wanted to stop and see if anyone else had any questions. But it 
5 does not look like that's the case. 
6 So if you are all right, we can do another 20 minutes or so and then take a 
7 5-minute break? 
8 
9 A 
Q Okay. 
Great. Thank you. 
10 So I wanted to ask a few questions now about your initial conversations with Mr. 
11 Weaver and your partnership with other groups in the post-election period. 
12 You said earlier that you were not initially planning to coordinate with any other 
13 groups, but obviously that changed at a certain point. 
14 
15 So, , if we can pull up exhibit 23. 
So this is an email exchange that you had with Amy Kremer, November 14th, 
16 2020. And then exhibit 24, which we don't have to pull up, is a similar exchange with 
17 Kylie Kremer on the same day. In both instances you mentioned that you would love to 
18 join forces on December 12th. 
19 So can you tell us about how you were introduced to the Kremers by 
20 November 14th? 
21 A Yeah. And also, as you can see from those texts, that it wasn't much of an 
22 exchange; it was more of a one-way conversation. 
23 
24 Q 
A Indeed. 
But I don't recall how I first got connected with them. There must have 
25 been some D.C. event, I don't remember. Maybe it was actually --wasn't there a  1 November 14th event in D.C. at the time? But that was it. 
2 
3 
4 
5 Q So you were --that was the day of the Million MAGA March in D.C. 
A Oh, yeah. 
Q Were you there? 
A I was at --I wasn't at the main thing. I think there was something by the 
6 Supreme Court that day. I don't recall exactly where. I was at something, but 
7 not --I'm not sure if I was at the big one. 24 
8 Q Uh-huh. And when did you eventually hear --did you ever hear back from 
9 the Kremers? 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 A 
Q 
A Later, but I don't recall how later in terms of the time line --
But there was no coordination --go ahead. Sorry, I cut you off. 
No, no. It's fine. 
Yes, later on, but I don't recall exactly the time line for when later on. 
Q So there was never a partnership with the Kremers and their organization for 
15 the December 12th event? 
16 
17 
18 
19 A No. 
Q Who were the partners for the December 12th event? 
A Ed Martin's group, the Schlafly group, and Stop the Steal. 
Q So can you tell me more about your partnership with Stop the Steal? When 
20 did that come into fruition? 
21 A I don't recall the exact dates, but I think it was --1 think it's --my first 
22 conversations by text with Ali were December 3rd. So I did not --I didn't have any 
23 communication on that. But I don't recall --I don't recall when, exactly when that came 
24 to be. 
25 Q Okay. So you had already decided on the December 12th event by the time  25 
1 you were in communication with Mr. Alexander? 
2 A Yes. He came in a lot later. So meaning that like if it --I would have to go 
3 back to see this --but if it was December 3rd, that would have been less than 10 days 
4 before the event. 
5 Q So who made the initial connection between you and Mr. Weaver and Mr. 
6 Alexander? 
7 A I don't recall exactly, but maybe through Ed. But I don't --I can't --I can't 
8 say for sure. 
Q Okay. Great. 9 
10 When did you make the decision to treat the December 12th event as a joint 
11 event between the Jericho March and Stop the Steal? 
12 A Again, I don't know if --what date exactly. I don't recall exactly the date, 
13 but I think it was pretty close to it, like I mentioned. 
14 Q And what was that partnership going to entail --coordination for speakers, 
15 for financing? 
16 A Exactly, both of those things. Rob and I both expressed just some concerns 
17 because we were focused more on the spiritual part of things, so we just wanted to make 
18 sure that, since this was a prayer rally, that Ali would also set the tone for the speakers he 
19 wanted to invite to be in the tone of prayer. 
20 And that is actually --in what was submitted to you all, you'll see that there were 
21 a couple documents that talk about the tone of the events and for the speakers. 
22 And so that is a conversation that Rob and I and Ali had together, whether he 
23 would agree, Ali, to make sure that any speakers he brings in would align with the 
24 spiritual tone of our event. 
25 Q Can you expand on that a little bit? Was there a conflict over the tone?  26 
1 Or how were you concerned about coordinating that? 
2 A No. But Stop the Steal --Stop the Steal events were people of faiths and no 
3 faith at all and ours was an overtly Judea-Christian prayer event. And so it was mixing 
4 two different kinds of crowds who cared about election integrity. 
5 Q So the question that comes up in my mind is, why did you want to have that 
6 partnership if there were two different messages, two different approaches? 
7 A I think just maybe --I don't know exactly why it all kind of came to be. 
8 know --well, as a background, I think Ali and the Kremers had a falling out at some point 
9 and I think people --different people were planning events. So it just seemed like 
10 maybe just joining for an event would make the event, I don't know, just more unified. 
11 
12 
13 Q 
A 
Q Uh-huh. 
So that not everyone's planning a whole number of events for the same day. 
That makes sense. 
14 Right now I'm going to run through a couple of names that are associated with 
15 Stop the Steal and a few other groups, and if you could just tell me, similar to the social 
16 media conversation, if you worked with them. And if you did, then we can pause and 
17 discuss that. 
18 That sound all right? 
A 
Q Sure. 
So the first --thank you, -
The first is Nathan Martin. I, taking down the exhibit. 19 
20 
21 
22 A So Ali --yes. Ali put me in touch with Nathan Martin to coordinate --and 
23 not just me, put Rob and I and others in touch to coordinate for points of contact at the 
24 State level. 
25 So basically what was happening at the State marches, you had Jericho marchers  27 
1 doing their prayer things, you had Stop the Steal people doing their protest things. And 
2 in coordination for the December 12th events, we thought, well, maybe we'd have the 
3 national one and that for the State ones they could coordinate to get speakers together 
4 for the State ones. 
5 So Nathan was really a point person for connecting us with their points of contact 
6 at the State level. 
7 
8 
9 Q Great. Thank you. 
How about Cindy Chafian? 
A She at the time --yes, she at the time was with the Kremers. I did not have 
10 very many interactions with her. 
11 
12 Q Okay. You mentioned Stephen Brown earlier. 
A Stephen Brown was contracted out to help with the logistics, filling out the 
13 permits, and helping put the --get the staging and all the logistics for putting such a big 
14 event on. 
15 
16 Q And that was just for December 12th? 
A That I recall, because we didn't have any event of that kind of --we didn't 
17 have any stage or anything. But I don't recall if he helped, what he helped with, if he 
18 helped with anything else. 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 Q Thank you. How about Kimberly Fletcher? 
A She is with Moms for America, right? She just had her own event. 
Q Okay. Katrina Pierson? 
A Her name sounds familiar, but I didn't have any interactions that I can recall. 
Q Okay. Jason Funes? 
A Not that I can recall. 
Q Okay. How about Charles Bowman?  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 A No, not that I can recall. 
Q Caroline Wren? 
A No. 
Q There are a few more. 
Marsha Lessard? 
A Not that I can recall. 
Q Thank you. 
Ed Martin? 
A Yes. 
Q So if you could just restate the context of your relationship? 28 
10 
11 A Ed Martin was with Phyllis Schlafly Eagles. Just coordinated as he was one 
12 of the cosponsors of the 12th, the December 12th event, so he coordinated on 
13 preparations for it. 
14 
15 
16 Q Thank you. 
How about Andrew Straka? 
A His name sounds familiar. I didn't --not that I can recall, I didn't 
17 coordinate. 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 Q Thank you. 
Roger Stone? 
A He was at some events, but I didn't coordinate with him. 
Q Mike Lindell? 
A Again, I saw him at events, but I didn't coordinate with him. 
Q Sidney Powell? 
A No. 
Q Rudy Giuliani?  29 
A No. 1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 Q Also, I realize I conflated two lines. It's Brandon Straka, not Andrew Straka? 
A Yeah. His last name sounded familiar. But no. 
Q He's with WalkAway. 
A I'm sorry? 
Q He's with the WalkAway Campaign. 
A Oh, okay. 
Q But the answer is the same. 
Michael Flynn? 
10 A Not --I didn't have connections with him, but I know that other people did. 
11 But I didn't. 
12 
13 
14 
15 Q 
A 
Q 
A How about Gregory Locke? 
Not that I can recall. 
Lance Wallnau? 
I think --I don't know him. I think he's in the evangelical circles, so Rob 
16 probably knew him. 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 Q What about Paula White? 
A Not --no, I was not in touch with her that I can recall. 
Q Okay. Brian Gibson? 
A No, not that I can recall. 
Q And Eric Metaxas? 
A Yes. We were in touch with him to emcee the December 12th event. 
Q Thank you. Those are all the names that I have right now. I'll have some 
24 more later. 
25 A Okay.  30 
1 Q if we could bring up exhibit 3. If we could zoom in a little bit 
2 on the second page. 
3 This is a newsletter that was sent out November 10th. 
4 
5 A 
Q Okay. 
Page 2, paragraph 2, you can see in the middle of the paragraph, you wrote, 
6 "President Trump is also aware of the Jericho Marches and is encouraged by them." 
7 
8 
9 A 
Q 
A Uh-huh. 
How do you know that President Trump was aware of the Jericho Marches? 
So that is a question for Rob. I don't have --I was not in those 
10 conversations or in any of those --I did not have that kind of a connection. 
11 
12 
13 Q 
A 
Q Okay. Do you have any idea of Rob's point of contact with the President? 
I don't. 
Okay. Well, I have a couple of questions on that and I'll ask them for the 
14 record, but feel free to tell me that you don't know. 
15 A follow-up on that. Did you ever discuss with him how he was in 
16 communication with the White House? 
17 
18 A 
Q 
19 capacity? 
20 
21 A 
Q 
22 the exhibit. I don't recall. I don't recall having anything like that kind of a conversation. 
And you had no contacts with anyone within the administration in this 
No. No, I did not. 
So we don't need to pull it up, but --and , you can take down 
23 We don't need to pull up exhibit 16, but there is a later Jericho March email that 
24 states, "We are getting reports that videos of marches have been 
25 shown" --quote/unquote --"to the top. He's being encouraged," as a reference to  31 
1 President Trump. 
2 That's from November 8th. It's actually an earlier email. But, again, you were 
3 not part of those conversations? 
4 
5 A 
Q Right. 
And it was your understanding that Mr. Weaver was having those 
6 conversations? 
7 
8 
9 A 
Q 
A 
Q Either Mr. Weaver or somebody else who was an intermediary, I don't know. 
Do you have any idea of who else that might have been? 
No, I don't. I don't know who that is. 
Okay. Thank you. 10 
11 So there was another point on exhibit 3 that I wanted to ask you about, and we 
12 don't have to pull it up again. But at the top of page 2 there's a line that references the 
13 fact that individuals and groups associated with the Jericho March were self-led. And I 
14 was curious if you could explain more about what self-led meant. 
15 A Sure. So because this was an organic prayer march, some people would go 
16 during their lunch breaks or on Sundays, et cetera. So we --the fliers were for noon of 
17 every day come and pray, but people went individually, independently on their own, with 
18 their families, their kids, according to their schedules, even with their parishioner 
19 members. 
20 So it wasn't a top down thing; it was more of an organic thing. Just go out there 
21 and pray, find the time, get a group, pray whatever prayers you want. Just find a time to 
22 pray. And so that's what the self-led meant. 
23 Q Got it. So when the events were self-led, you didn't have any role as a 
24 national coordinator of them, it was more organic. 
25 A Right. And even the different ones at the local level, people prayed  32 
1 whatever they wanted to, people sang songs. So they did not go into that level of detail. 
2 We just let people pray in their own way. 
3 But obviously, as from the very beginning, as you saw from the fliers, it was always 
4 peaceful, prayerful, with fast if they wanted to, and that's what they were. 
5 So there's never an instance of any violence affiliated with any Jericho Marches 
6 because it was family friendly, it was people of faith. So yeah. 
7 
8 Q Got it. And there was one more question on that exhibit, which maybe we 
should pull up, again, if you're able to, Exhibit 3. Thank you. 
9 The one time I ask you to take it down on time and then I need it to be back up 
10 again. 
11 So on page 1, towards the bottom, there are several references to Judea-Christian 
12 and forms of Judea-Christian worship. And I wanted to just ask you, for explanatory 
13 purposes, what you meant by that. 
14 A Sure. So the Joshua story is an Old Testament story, so it's something that 
15 people who hold to Old Testament and/or New Testament would follow or be. And so 
16 it's just Judea-Christian principles, the same Judea-Christian principles that our Nation 
17 was founded upon. That was the idea. 
18 And also, as you could see in there, it lists different ways people could 
19 participate --praying, preaching, singing, rosaries, Eucharistic procession, shofars --to 
20 show the diversity of ways that people might want to pray in their own tradition. 
21 Q So was the Jericho March open to other faiths that were not Judea-Christian 
22 or was it just that dynamic? 
23 A The Jericho March was a Judea-Christian organization, but there were 
24 people --there are people that --we had accounts that people would just stand around 
25 and watch, and some people would just join, and we don't know if they had any faith at  33 
1 all. 
2 And, in fact, while the Jericho March people at the State level were doing the 
3 rounds and praying the rosaries, passersby, people standing around might watch, even 
4 people who were maybe there doing protests with Stop the Steal, some would just want 
5 to pray with us and start doing that. 
6 So it was just anyone who wanted to come and pray with us could.  1 
2 [3:04 p.m.] 
3 BY-: 
4 Q Thank you. 
5 And I had a couple of more questions on the statewide event, statewide 
6 campaign, and then we can probably take a break, because we've been going for about 
7 an hour. 
8 
9 A 
Q Okay. 
So --and thank you, 
10 You mentioned that there were a number of Jericho March events occurring in 
11 State capitals, and I wanted to ask specifically what role you and Mr. Weaver had in 
12 organizing those events, as opposed to the December 12th rally. 
13 
14 
15 A 
Q 
A For the December 12th rally you mean? 
No, for the other statewide events. 
So, again, we helped to just see if there were points of contact who could 
16 kind of take the lead in those States from the faith community. And then, again, you 
17 have the document of, you know, tone and maybe even just --there was a format of, 
18 here are you things you can --how you can organize the day's events. You know, you 
19 can start with a pledge and a patriotic song and an "Our Father." 34 
20 So it was giving them ideas for formatting and just trying to help coordinate to see 
21 if there were local faith leaders, et cetera, that wanted to speak or lead the prayers for 
22 their events. 
23 But, really, at the end of the day, the local ones were run by local people. So we 
24 saw the photos or videos of the events but didn't have --it wasn't so much of a top-down. 
25 It was just more of trying to put people in touch with each other so they could plan their  35 
1 own events. 
2 Q That makes sense. 
3 We talked a little bit about this earlier, that you were planning them at State 
4 capitol buildings, but were there other areas where you were hoping that they would 
5 occur --for example, courthouses or vote counting centers? Or was it only State 
6 capitols? 
7 A So there were people who decided to pray at other places. So there was 
8 one group that wanted to pray at the courthouse because they were too far away from 
9 the capitol. I don't know of all the different places people were praying, except if they, 
10 you know, said, hey, we're praying in this location. 
11 But our focus was just to try to keep people in one location. That way, it wasn't 
12 so dispersed. They would just kind of know of one place to meet and pray, and it was a 
13 time. So that's why on the fliers that Jericho March put out it said noon, State capitols, 
14 as a general thing. But, again, because it was so organic, churches and groups would 
15 decide what time and where they wanted to. 
16 Q Understood. 
17 What was the nature of your outreach --well, if any --to State elected officials 
18 during those events? 
19 A Again, we just asked the groups that were there to see if there were faith 
20 leaders, anyone else, any State officials, that wanted to speak. But I don't recall having 
21 any of those from my end or something like that. 
22 
23 
24 Q Okay. 
Were there ever any reports of security problems at these events in the States? 
A I don't recall exactly. Either in Michigan or Wisconsin, at some point, there 
25 was some Black Lives Matter counterprotesters or something, but the Jericho March  36 
1 group there just kept on praying. So not any from within or anything like that. 
2 If anything, groups that went out there also just wanted to feel safe being able to 
3 go out there and pray. So, for example, when things that were happening in D.C., that 
4 kind of --like, even for anything with January 6th --but, like, when there were other types 
5 of counterprotests like that, that was, you know, scary to them, because they would 
6 have --like I said, they would bring their children to pray. 
7 But, no, besides that --and, again, I don't remember which State it was 
8 where there was some kind of a counter, but they just kept praying. 
9 Q Okay. And it was your understanding this was a Black Lives Matter 
10 counterprotest? 
11 
12 
13 A 
Q I don't recall exactly. It was just some kind of counterprotesters. 
I also want to note for the record --I should've done this earlier, 
but -- is here. She's a staff associate. She's also in the room. 
14 Sorry about that. 
15 A Okay. 
16 Q I also wanted to ask if you ever had reports of other groups that were 
17 present. I can run through a few names. The Proud Boys? 
18 A I don't know. So the Jericho Marches were just our thing. I don't know 
19 what other groups may have been in the same places at the same time. 
20 I do know Stop the Steal was also doing events at State capitols at noon, I think, 
21 but their events were separate. They would bring their own speakers. They would 
22 kind of do their own thing. It was just, like, two separate groups, kind of similar space, 
23 but separate groups. 
24 So I don't know what other groups may have been at --doing their own thing. 
25 But the Jericho Marchers were there to pray.  37 
1 Q Understood. The Proud Boys also had prayer meetings occasionally. So I 
2 wanted to ask if there had ever been reports that they had been involved in Jericho 
3 March events or if you had planned for that in States. It doesn't sound like that's the 
4 case? 
5 
6 
7 A 
Q 
A I don't recall that, no. 
How about Oath Keepers? 
Again, I don't recall. I never even heard of these groups before --I guess, 
8 before all this stuff. 
9 
10 
11 Q Sure. 
A No, I had no connection with them. 
Q Okay. Well, I have one more. I expect the answer will be the same, but 
12 Three Percenters? Any reports of them in the States? 
13 
14 them. 
15 
16 A Same. I don't recall. I don't have any --I didn't have any contact with 
Q That makes sense. 
- Well, I think this is a good point to take a break, unless anyone else 
17 has questions. 
18 No, it doesn't seem like anyone does. So we can take a break. And then, after 
19 that, we will get into the December 12th event itself and then move on towards the 6th. 
20 But thank you for your cooperation so far. 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 Ms. Grossu. You're welcome. 
- We can go off the record at 3:12 and come back at 3:17. 
Ms. Grossu. Okay. Thank you. 
[Recess.] 
- We can go back on the record at 3:21 p.m.  38 
1 And, at this point, Ms. Grossu, I'd like to turn in more detail to the preparation for 
2 the December 12th event in Washington, D.C. 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 And, at this point, 
I can try to do it --could we pull up exhibit 25? 
That's okay. I've got it. 
- Great. Thank you. 
BY-: 
Q So this email is between Ali Alexander, you, and Ed Martin, and I believe 
9 Robert Weaver. Yes, he's there too. And this goes back to a couple of things we were 
10 talking about earlier, about your coordination with Stop the Steal and the Eagle Forum 
11 before the December 12th event. 
12 So I guess I wanted to ask again, by the time you got up to the days before 
13 December 12th, how closely were you coordinating with Ali Alexander and Stop the Steal 
14 for the event? 
15 A So Rob and I had our list of different speakers. The majority, there were a 
16 lot of faith leaders on there of different faith backgrounds. Ali had his list of people he 
17 wanted. I don't remember what Ed wanted as well. 
18 So it was that, you know, the person who was most closely affiliated with 
19 whatever speaker invited them. So my role was the Catholic faith leaders and some of 
20 the Orthodox and those leaders. That was kind of my part in it. 
21 Q And Mr. Martin and Mr. Alexander were focused more on the political 
22 speakers? 
23 A I think they were --Rob too --they were more focused on that, although Rob 
24 also was in charge of the Evangelical leaders as well. 
25 Q So you weren't really involved in outreach to the political offices?  1 
2 A 
Q No, not that I can recall any. 
Okay. That's helpful. 
3 And in the fifth paragraph --"This is coupled," that's how it starts --there's a 
4 mention of an agreement that Mr. Alexander references there. 
5 Can you expand on that? What kind of agreement was he --is this the formal 
6 coalition agreement that you had to cosponsor the event? 
7 A I don't recall specifically --I don't recall specifically what that was about. 
8 There was a general --you know, we're cosponsoring, so kind of, like, trying to see what 
9 everybody, each individual group, was interested in having. 
10 
11 
12 Q 
A 
Q Uh-huh. 
So you'd have to ask him what he meant by that. 
Sure. 39 
13 Was the agreement with any other --the agreement to co-host the event with any 
14 other organizations besides Jericho March, the Eagle Forum, and Stop the Steal? 
15 A Trump --whatever flier --I think it was Moms for --I'm not sure whichever 
16 one. The ones that were --there were logos of each of the different ones on the 
17 December 12th. 
18 
19 Q 
A Great. 
And might I also add that, in deciding, you know, whether or not to 
20 cosponsor, Rob and I felt very strongly about the fact that any speaker would speak from 
21 a faith perspective. 
22 And so there --you have somewhere in your document production, there was, 
23 like, a document that shows what's the Jericho March Prayer Rally objective, what's the 
24 tone of our prayer rally, and what is the content that we want from the speakers. And 
25 this went to the speakers. And so that was something that was important.  40 
1 And you could see that, on the tone of the prayer rally: prayerful, spirit-filled, 
2 peaceful, joyful, and vibrant, a unified celebration. 
3 And then, in terms of the content for the speakers, we wanted all of them, 
4 including the ones that Ali or anyone else suggested, to somehow relate it back to faith 
5 matters. 
6 So, as you could tell from that, it says, it is not a time for self-promotion or 
7 product promotion, but a time to promote God and prayer, a renewal of the church rising 
8 up in faith, to stand for truth and justice, a time of repentance, et cetera, et cetera. So it 
9 suggested things, prayer and petitions, et cetera. 
10 So, in terms of the tone of the December 12th event, that is actually what went 
11 out to, you know, various speakers and what even just verbally we discussed in terms of 
12 what the speakers --how the speakers would conduct themselves, no matter who was 
13 the one who originally wanted to bring them on. 
14 Q That is helpful. 
15 And, again, you would say the goal of that event was transparency rather than 
16 advocating for a particular result in the election? 
17 A It's for transparency, election integrity. You know, just wanted to make 
18 sure that whatever was happening was just and that the people's votes was heard. 
19 But the event itself was a prayer rally. So it was actually --there were praise and 
20 worship leaders. Of course you had the spiritual leaders. But, even more specifically, 
21 for any of the political ones, those are --we still wanted them to also speak from a 
22 spiritual perspective. 
23 And so I think that you would see that in some of the things like Michele 
24 Bachmann, right, and her message and things like that. We really directed people to 
25 just really focus on the spiritual aspect of this.  Q There's one quick question I have on another part of this email, which I 
think -- if you could scroll down just a little bit? 1 
2 
3 Oh, no, no. Scroll up. 
4 So he writes --Mr. Alexander writes that he's worried things might be ignored 
5 after he's wired money. 
6 So I wanted to ask you if Stop the Steal was providing funding for the Jericho 
7 March event in addition to the Eagle Forum. 
8 A I'm not familiar with that set-up. I think that the different sponsoring 
9 groups put in money. I don't know what the set-up was with Eagle Forum or Stop the 
10 Stea I, so --
11 
12 Q 
A So who would've been handling that? Would that have been Mr. Brown? 
I think in terms of --so he was the logistical guy. In terms of the money, 
13 again, it would've probably just gone to the Ed's account set up for this. 
14 
15 
16 that. 
17 Q 
A 
Q Understood. 
And I don't know --yeah, I don't know in terms of any more details about 
Uh-huh. Okay. 41 
18 Were you aware of security that was being hired for the event? So, earlier in the 
19 email, Mr. Alexander says that these plans have to get cleared with security. Were you 
20 involved in any of that? 
21 A I was not involved in it. I know that we --there was --we wanted the event 
22 to be safe. And, you know, it's just a large event you're planning, so I know that Stephen 
23 Brown was logistically just trying to make sure that, you know, the permits were in place, 
24 the law enforcement, and that the event itself would be secure, run smoothly, and all of 
25 that.  42 
1 Q Were you aware of individual speakers who would have their own security 
2 entourages? 
3 A I know the day of that --but I don't recall --I didn't recall any of who brought 
4 whom. I actually think --well, Mike Flynn probably brought security. But I don't know 
5 who came with whom. 
6 Q Got it. And what was the name of the security company that you had hired 
7 for the event itself? 
8 A I don't recall. I think probably, like, someone who was doing the logistics 
9 would have that. 
10 Q Okay. Thank you. 
11 Were you ever aware of militia groups or private actors providing security for the 
12 event itself? 
13 A Again, I was not involved in any of that, so I don't know. I was not involved 
14 in getting security. 
15 Q And I'm just going to list a few names, again, of various private groups and 
16 militias, and if you are familiar of them being involved at all with security for the event or 
17 with individual speakers, let me know. 
18 So the first is the Proud Boys or their chairman, Enrique Tarrio. 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q I don't recall any of that. 
Okay. 
The First Amendment Praetorian or Philip Luelsdorff? 
A I don't recall that. 
Q 
A 
Q They provided security for Lieutenant General Flynn that day. 
Okay. 
Did you ever have any interaction with them?  1 A No, not that I can recall. I was behind the scenes a lot just coordinating 
2 day-of things, so --
3 
4 
5 
6 Q Would Mr. Weaver have had interactions with them? 
A You would have to ask him about that. 
Q Okay. 
How about Robert Patrick Lewis? He was also with the First Amendment 
7 Praetorian. 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 A I don't --I don't know who that is. 
Q Okay. 
What about the Groypers or America First? That's Nick Fuentes's group. 
A Again, I don't recall. I don't --that's, again, not a question for me. 
Q Well, they had an event also in D.C. on December 12th, I believe by the 
13 Supreme Court. But you don't remember having any interactions with them? 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 A Not me personally. 
Q Do you know of anyone else who did? 
A I don't know. 
Q Okay. 
The next group is Veterans for Trump. 
A I was not involved with this part, so, no, I don't recall that at all. 
Q And I'll just ask for the record. I know you weren't --
A No. 
Q The Oath Keepers? 
A I'm sorry? 
Q The Oath Keepers? 
A No, I didn't --I was not involved with that. 43  1 
2 Q Okay. Thanks. 
So I'd like to follow up on the last point a little bit, on the Oath Keepers. What 44 
3 was the nature of your communications with Stewart Rhodes, who is the president of the 
4 Oath Keepers? 
5 A I don't recall having any personal communications with him. I know that 
6 the night before the December 12th event he was added to the list of speakers, but --
7 Q Okay. So we'll get to that, but your own personal communications with 
8 him, you don't recall any? 
9 
10 
11 
12 A 
Q 
A No. 
Did you meet him at the December 12th event? 
Not that I recall. 
Q Okay. And I know you don't know the answer, but was it your 
13 understanding that Mr. Weaver was having communications with Mr. Rhodes? 
14 A I don't --I don't know how --I honestly don't know how Mr. Rhodes ended 
15 up becoming a speaker. 
16 
17 
18 
19 Q Okay. That's helpful. I think that's --
A All I know is I got his bio. That's it. 
Q Okay. 
Well, before we get to the bio, I actually was going to ask 
20 another exhibit. 
21 Exhibit 14, if you could? to pull up 
22 So this is the Signal chat between Stewart Rhodes and another person associated 
23 with the Oath Keepers. It's from December 9th, a couple days before the rally. And 
24 you can see that Mr. Rhodes says that Rob Weaver reached out to ask for a contact with 
25 Senator Kennedy from Louisiana.  45 
1 Did you have any awareness of Mr. Rhodes speaking with Mr. Weaver in the days 
2 leading up to the December 12th event? 
3 
4 A No. Just, like I said, just getting the bio from Rob. 
Q Okay. Are you surprised to see that Mr. Rhodes had been speaking with 
5 him days before the event? 
6 
7 
8 
9 A I mean, this was the first time I've seen this, so yeah. 
Q Okay. 
We can take it down. And, we can pull up exhibit 8. 
Thank you for bearing with me with the exhibits. That's the downside of making 
10 a large production. 
11 And this is, I think, the emails you were talking about with --
12 
13 A Yeah. 
Q --Mr. Weaver asking you to add Mr. Rhodes to the event. Were you 
14 surprised at the time at the ask? 
15 A I mean, honestly, we had, I don't know, 40 or 50 people on the list of 
16 speakers. It was a really big, I would say, event, so people were flying off and on the list 
17 like crazy. So --and I didn't --again, my familiarity with these groups was not really that 
18 much, so it wasn't --to me, it wasn't --I'm just not in that circle. 
19 
20 
21 Q 
A 
Q 
22 have him in? 
A Uh-huh. Did you know who Mr. Rhodes was before these emails? 
No. 
Did you have any conversations with Mr. Weaver about why he wanted to 
I don't recall that either. 23 
24 
25 Q Okay. No problem. Just wondering --
A Again, I'm not sure --I'm not sure --yeah, I don't know what his  1 conversations with him were or --
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 Q Okay. 
If you could scroll down, 
You can see it's just Mr. Rhodes sending over his bio. 
A Right. 
Q Which is a couple of days after Mr. Rhodes said they spoke about Senator 46 
7 Kennedy's contact info. But, in the interim, you hadn't had any mention of Mr. Rhodes 
8 speaking? Hadn't heard any of that? 
9 
10 
11 A I don't recall any of that. I don't --
Q Okay. And I guess --
A And it wouldn't have stuck out --and even if --I don't think it did, but even if 
12 so, it wouldn't have rang any kind of bell for me, just because I'm not familiar with these 
13 groups. 
14 Q So you didn't have any particular concerns raised about the tone of the 
15 event being changed by Mr. Rhodes being there, that you can recall? 
16 A I don't recall --I was just --I was honestly just trying to survive. I was on, 
17 like, 3 or 4 days of very little sleep, getting ready for the event, and I was just still doing a 
18 lot of logistics, helping with --just trying to help with getting it going. So I don't --I don't 
19 recall --I don't recall that. 
20 For example --and we'll probably get to this, but, if anything, from what I had 
21 heard about Alex Jones, that was something that I had expressed before, like --I don't 
22 know --you know, it was just more of --I had more familiarity with him than I did with 
23 Mr. Rhodes or something like that. 
24 
25 Q And did you raise concerns about Mr. Jones --
A Yeah.  1 
2 Q 
A 47 
--speaking? 
And --uh-huh. And I know Rob also was a bit uncomfortable with that. 
3 But, you know, that was someone that Ali really wanted, you know, as part of his part of 
4 the people that he was inviting. 
5 Again, if you look at our December 8th press release, Alex Jones was not on it. 
6 Rhodes was never on our press release, even on the morning of the 12th. So I don't 
7 know exactly --so basically both --there were some --some of these were last-minute 
8 add-ons and --yeah. 
9 Q I understand that there was a lot of last-minute change to the event, and 
10 that makes sense. 
11 I'm curious, though, if you remember any reaction to reading Mr. Rhodes's bio. 
12 The last couple of lines, he says that he's on record using his power to, quote/unquote, 
13 "invoke the Insurrection Act and drop the hammer on the ongoing Deep State 
14 insurrection." 
15 Do you remember if that raised any concerns on your end about the tone of the 
16 event, which I know you've characterized as seeking truth rather than a particular 
17 outcome? 
18 A I don't actually even recall reading the bio. I was just helping to make sure 
19 that, you know, the speakers had a time slot. 
20 Like --so I don't recall --I was just helping with the logistics and wasn't really 
21 doing all that, especially because I don't --I don't think that --I don't even know if 
22 maybe --I don't know who read their bias or why even he sent a bio, frankly. So it was 
23 just like, "Add this person." "Okay." 
24 
25 Q Got it. 
Did you know what the Insurrection Act was at the time?  1 
2 A I don't --I don't recall really knowing anything of that. 
Q Okay. That's helpful. 
3 So I guess it's safe to say that you weren't really flagging potential concerns with 
4 Mr. Rhodes's appearance --
5 
6 
7 A Right. 
Q --in a sense, then. 
A And I'll go so far as to say that, even during the event, I was coordinating 48 
8 things in the back, you know, on the side stage, on this, talking to people, so I also didn't 
9 hear a lot of the speeches. 
10 
11 Q Uh-huh. 
A Some of them I had to watch later on, myself, just because I was just working 
12 an event. 
13 Q Understood. Understood. And we'll get --I have a couple of clips --a clip 
14 of Mr. Rhodes that we can get to soon. 
15 
16 But, first, , can we pull up exhibit 4? 
And this appears to be a draft lineup of speakers for December 12th. And if you 
17 could just confirm that when it comes up, that would be great. 
18 So it seems like this is an earlier iteration of the speaker lineup. 
19 
20 A 
Q Right. 
But there it says that there are a number of political leaders who are invited 
21 and to talk to our President Trump and Vice President Pence. 
22 
23 A 
Q Uh-huh. 
I expect this is not something you're going to know, but how did you 
24 communicate those invitations? 
25 A So, I didn't. I don't know who did.  1 
2 
3 Q Okay. Do you know if you ever received a response? 
A I --obviously they didn't speak, so I don't know if there was a response. 
Q Okay. More broadly, at any point, did you have any indication that 
4 President Trump was going to appear at the event? 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 A Not that he was going to appear at the event, no. 
Q But the flyover? 
A The flyover --there was talk that maybe he would fly over. 
Q 
A Uh-huh. And that was communicated to you from? 
I think Rob. Rob would probably know more about details about that. 
Q Okay. 
One second. 49 
10 
11 
12 And I think my next question is a little more general and --Vice President Pence on 
13 the list. Were you involved in conversations about wanting the Vice President to 
14 appear? 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 A I don't recall. I was just --
Q Okay. 
A --putting a list together of people. I don't recall. 
Q Okay. That's helpful. 
Can we pull up exhibit 7? 
This is another lineup, I believe the last lineup. 
So, if we scroll down a little bit to the middle of the page, I believe, you can 
see --a little bit more, Thank you. 
So I think it's on the second page. There's a mention of "political big names." 
24 And I was wondering, who were the political big names that you had planned on having? 
25 A Sorry. Can you repeat that? I'm trying to follow you.  Q 
A "Political big names" --
Oh, I see. Okay. 
Q Yeah. Do you recall the big names that were planned? 
A I don't. I think it's just whatever I have there in the draft. 
Q Okay. That's helpful. That's helpful context. 
And who is Felisa? Her name appears in a couple of the exhibits. 
A Felisa also helped with some speaker lineups. 
Q Okay. Was she affiliated with the Jericho March or Stop the Steal? 50 
1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 A She --like, I think she was contracted out or something. I don't know how 
10 Felisa came to help us. Maybe that's another question for Rob or Ali. 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 Q Do you know her last name? 
A I mean, I'd have to look it up. 
Q Okay. 
A Not off the top of my head. 
Q That would be helpful, if you could follow up with that. 
A Okay. 
Q Thank you. 
And, if at this point we could pull up exhibit 17? 
And this is an email from December 4th. And it's a similar question to what I 
20 already asked, but I just want to be crystal-clear. 
21 In this email, you write that President Trump may be dropping by; you've learned 
22 he may be dropping by. Did you have any indication about why you learned he was 
23 dropping by? Is that a reference to the flyover or something else? 
24 
25 A I don't know. That was Rob. 
Q Okay. All right. Well, thank you.  1 At this point, I think I wanted to move into more discussion of the event itself, 
2 unless anyone has any questions? 
3 But it seems like no. 
4 You've mentioned this a little bit before, but what was your role that day? 
5 A Well, it was helping with some logistics and just helping to make sure the 
6 different parts of it go well. I mean, like, in terms of coming --I think that there was 
7 some running list of speakers and time slots and all of that. 
8 
9 Q Okay. Did you have any interactions with speakers on that day? 
A Yeah. But, again, I don't recall all of the --some of them. I mean, the 
10 Orthodox leaders. I think we got a quick picture with Michael Flynn but didn't talk 
11 to --couldn't get --he was just whisked away. 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 Q Okay. 
A But I don't --
Q So you mentioned Michael Flynn. What about Mike Lindell? 
A I don't remember if I --I'm trying to remember anything like that. 
Q Okay. How about Stewart Rhodes? 
A I don't recall that at all. 
Q And in terms of personal security for the speakers, you would've only had 
19 incidental interaction with them? 
20 A Right. Whoever was --if someone --if a speaker had a security person, 51 
21 they'd just kind of be on the side, waiting for the person to come off the stage, and then 
22 go. So, no, I didn't --
23 Q Okay. 
24 And, on that note, did you have any particular concerns about security, going into 
25 the rally?  52 
1 A Well, we just wanted to make sure we're safe, but not --not anything else. 
2 Just wanted --obviously it's a big event, so wanted to make sure that, for example, that 
3 there weren't going to be any counterprotesters, that we had security, some sort of --
4 Q Were there any particular threats --you mentioned Black Lives Matter 
5 earlier --any particular threats you were worried about that day? 
6 A Not specifically. Just, obviously, other events around D.C. You know, 
7 sometimes it would just --we just didn't want anything happening at our event. So we 
8 just wanted to, you know, keep it safe, and so that was our main concern. 
9 
10 Q 
A Okay. 
And we also wanted to end before sunset, the event, so that people could 
11 get home safely. 
12 Q Okay. 
13 And, to your knowledge --you mentioned this already, but --there were no Proud 
14 Boys at the event that you knew of? 
15 A Not to my knowledge. 
16 
17 
18 Q Okay. 
So, at this point, can we pull up exhibit 12, 
And this is a video of Stewart Rhodes's speech at the rally. And it's a short clip, 
19 just about a minute or so, so we can watch it in full. And then I have a couple questions 
20 about it. 
A Okay. 21 
22 Ms. Grossu. I'm not hearing anything. 
23 - Me neither. 
24 And we're, I think, over halfway through, so I don't think that the timing should be 
25 a problem, so we can give this another minute.  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 Thank you, 
Sorry about that. That should work now. 
- No worries. 
[Video shown.] 
- You can take the exhibit down,

Q 
A So did you hear that speech at the time? 
I don't recall --no, I don't recall. Like I said, I was coordinating things on 
9 the side with other speakers, so I don't recall. 53 
10 Q Well, in his speech, you can hear him say President Trump should invoke the 
11 Insurrection Act to, quote/unquote, "drop the hammer on traitors." Did you remember 
12 speaking to anyone about that? 
13 
14 A 
Q No, because I don't recall his speech. 
He also says that civilians may have to be called up to fight as a militia and 
15 that if Trump did not call up a militia, as you heard, civilians might have to fight, 
16 themselves, later in a much more desperate, much more bloody war, quote/unquote. 
17 And he also suggests that we should get it on now while he's still Commander in 
18 Chief, meaning Trump. 
19 Did --do you have a reaction to that? 
20 A Again, I don't remember his speech, so --I mean, obviously, these are not 
21 the things that I would've, you know, wanted said from the stage. As I mentioned 
22 before, the document showed what --the types and the tone of what we wanted from 
23 the speakers, so --
24 
25 Q 
A So you would say this does not comport with the -­
No.  1 
2 Q 
A 54 
--political --
Absolutely not. Right. So it doesn't tie to the faith. It didn't, you 
3 know --it didn't have the tone --the tone, "prayerful, spirit-filled, peaceful, joyful, and 
4 vibrant." That is what was in our document. It was, tie it to faith matters, tie it to 
5 repentance, tie it to conversion. 
6 So, again, this is, again, not someone that I wanted or --you know, again, I didn't 
7 really know him, so it was --
8 
9 Q Yeah. Understood. 
Did you have any conversations with Mr. Weaver after, or Mr. Alexander, about 
10 Mr. Rhodes's speech? Because that's pretty strong language. 
11 A Like I said, I didn't even --I don't recall even hearing that speech, so I didn't 
12 have a conversation about it. 
13 Q I guess my question is, did you reconvene later on to talk about issuing a 
14 statement about his speech, distancing yourself from what was said at the rally by 
15 Mr. Rhodes or anything like that? 
16 
17 A 
Q I don't recall --I don't recall even doing, like, a debrief after. 
Okay. So there were no conversations about any of the speeches that were 
18 given that day between you and Mr. Weaver after the 12th? 
19 
20 
21 A 
Q 
A I don't remember. 
Did you have any other conversation --
1 was sleeping for 12 hours after the event, for 12 hours straight. I went 
22 home right after the event and went to sleep. 
23 Q So there was no followup from either you or Mr. Weaver about Mr. Rhodes 
24 or the Oath Keepers and their interaction with the event? 
25 A I don't recall this. I mean, you could ask Rob about it as well. I don't  55 
1 recall. 
2 Q Do you have a sense of whether Mr. Rhodes had planned to say that at 
3 the event? Seems like no? 
4 A I don't know what he had planned. I don't know any of that. You'd have 
5 to ask him. 
6 Q There were other prominent speakers that day, as we've talked about. 
7 One of them was Lieutenant General Flynn. You mentioned you saw him only briefly. 
8 Do you recall his speech at all? 
9 A I don't recall --like, I don't have a very good memory for these things. Like, 
10 I don't recall, like, things like speeches or things like that. But --so I honestly would 
11 have to go back and actually listen to them. 
12 
13 Q Uh-huh. 
So, in his speech, he said, "There are still avenues," quote/unquote, to contesting 
14 the election. And he also said, quote/unquote, "We're fighting with faith, and we're 
15 fighting with courage." 
16 And I guess you didn't hear any of that at the time. But did you have any 
17 conversations with Mr. Weaver after the fact, or Mr. Alexander or Mr. Martin, about 
18 whether that was an appropriate speech for your joyful, unifying event? 
19 
20 
21 A 
Q I don't recall. 
Okay. 
As I mentioned, there were several other events in D.C. that day that were not 
22 your joint event with Stop the Steal. Did you have any interaction with those events? 
23 A No. I didn't. I was at the Jericho March event, and then I ended up going 
24 home. 
25 Q Okay. So no intersection with Nick Fuentes's America First event by the  1 Supreme Court? 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 A No, I didn't go to that. 
Q How about Alex Jones? 
A What about Alex Jones? 
Q Did you have any interaction with him? 
A Not personally. 
Q Okay. 
A These are not people I personally know. 
Q But before we move on, I actually want to play a brief clip of an interview 
10 that you did on the day of the Jericho March event, on December 12th. 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 So, if you could pull up exhibit 15? 
[Video shown.] 
- Great. Thank you, 
B~: 
Q So I have a few questions on that clip in light of some of the conversations 
16 we've had. 56 
17 The first is, you mentioned that you believed that the election --that the American 
18 people did vote for President Trump and that --you specifically said you wanted the fraud 
19 to be revealed. 
20 So, going back on some of our earlier exchanges about just wanting the truth to 
21 come out, I guess I'd be curious to know, did you believe that if the truth came out 
22 President Trump would remain President? 
23 
24 A 
Q Well, if that's what the audits and the votes showed. 
Right. At the time, given that clip, it seems like that's where your head 
25 was. So is that an accurate description?  1 A Yeah, that was my personal opinion. I did want there to be investigations 
2 to make sure that only authentic votes were counted. And so --
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 [Audio interruption.] 
A 
Q --I know a lot of places didn't do recounts, et cetera. 
Got it. 
You also said in the clip that this was --
The Reporter. Excuse me. I'm sorry for interrupting. That last answer was 
8 not clear because her audio was buffering for part of it. 
9 - Thank you. It was for me. I wasn't sure if that was just me or for 
10 others as well. 
11 BY-: 
12 
13 Q 
A Ms. Grossu, I'm not sure --if you could just repeat that last answer? 
I don't even know how to repeat that answer. I just wanted the truth to 
14 come out and only the authentic votes to be counted and the audits to be done. 
15 Q And you said something about recounts too? That's the part --
Right. 
--I didn't catch. So can you restate that for the record? 57 
16 
17 
18 A 
Q 
A I don't know exactly how I said it, but just that in some States they didn't do 
19 recounts, and people had questions about all of that. So that was --that an audit would 
20 reveal any irregularities that took place. 
21 Q Got it. 
22 You also said that this, being the struggle to get truth out of the election, I 
23 suppose, is a battle, and you said, not just on a spiritual level but on a flesh and blood 
24 level, and it was on a temporal plane and a spiritual plane. 
25 Can you walk me through what you mean when you said "flesh and blood battle"?  58 
1 A No, I think that maybe you misunderstood that quote, that this is not a 
2 battle with flesh and blood, but it's with --a spiritual battle. 
3 Q In the video you say --and we can play it again --a battle not just on a 
4 temporal level but also a spiritual one. And you said you're battling not just with flesh 
5 and blood, with spiritual forces too. 
6 So I understand some of the conversation about spiritual plane and spiritual 
7 forces. We discussed that a little bit earlier. I'm more curious about the "flesh and 
8 blood" component of what you --
9 A So that's a scripture passage, that our battle is not with flesh and blood but 
10 with the principalities, with the spiritual powers that are around us. So I was quoting 
11 scripture. 
12 Q So can you explain how the reference to battles on a temporal plane were 
13 relevant to this conversation? Is that also a reference to scripture or --
14 Mr. Greim. Counsel, I'm going to jump in here, just because we're getting into 
15 her personal beliefs and her religious beliefs. And I think part of it may just be --may be 
16 a misunderstanding. 
17 There's a passage from the Bible where --I believe it's Saint Paul, right? 
18 
19 Ms. Grossu. I can look it up. 
Mr. Greim. Yeah --who says, this is not --he says, put on the --I forget the exact 
20 phrase, but --put on the, you know, your spiritual armor. And he says, it's not a matter 
21 of --
22 Ms. Grossu. Yeah. Ephesians 6:12. "Our struggle is not against flesh and 
23 blood but against the rulers, against authorities, against the powers of this dark world, 
24 and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms." 
25 Mr. Greim. So you don't have to read it. I mean -- 1 
2 Ms. Grossu. Ephesians 6:12. 
Mr. Greim. Yeah, the committee does not want to know your religious or your 59 
3 political beliefs. We would never, you know, submit somebody to be questioned on 
4 that. 
5 But her point, though, is that what Paul --what Saint Paul is saying there is, he's 
6 trying to get people to understand that there is a spiritual dimension. Saint Paul is not 
7 talking about a flesh and blood battle, nor was she. She was trying to emphasize a 
8 spiritual point. 
9 And that's what the witness is trying to tell you. I think you kind of skipped right 
10 back to asking her again about what the flesh and blood battle was. I think her answer 
11 was, she was quoting scripture that focused on the spiritual battle. 
12 So I think we're going to run into this, -if we get a lot more into her political 
13 and religious beliefs and have her, you know, testifying under section 1001 about those 
14 things. 
15 - I appreciate that. And you are correct that, obviously, we're not 
16 trying to question about the context of your religious beliefs or pry into that. 
17 BY-: 
18 Q My question would be, based on what you just represented to us, you 
19 changed that quote in the clip --and we can watch the clip again. But you implied that 
20 we're battling against both spiritual and temporal, flesh and blood forces. 
21 So my question was about the temporal, flesh and blood piece of it. Because I 
22 think that's a change, where you're trying to suggest a battle on both fronts, as opposed 
23 to a battle just on the spiritual front. That is where we have an interest in 
24 understanding why you were using that language, what you meant by that. 
25 Does that make sense?  60 
1 A I understand your --what you're --your words. I don't know if we need to 
2 re-listen to it or just --
3 Q Sure. And, obviously, this is important to our conversation, because we 
4 also have heard what Stewart Rhodes was saying on stage. He was calling up 
5 able-bodied men to serve as a militia, have President Trump invoke the --
6 A I absolutely --I can tell you this: I absolutely never --again, Jericho March 
7 has always been a peaceful, prayerful organization, mission. And I was quoting scripture 
8 about that, that it is not with, you know, flesh and blood but the powers of principalities, 
9 which is, like, the devil. 
10 But I would --I would never --there's no way that's coming from me, that that's 
11 something that could be interpreted in any way but peaceful. There was nothing in 
12 there --I think that taking that, it would be a distortion of --of my --of my spirit, really. 
13 A distortion.  61 
1 
2 [4:12 p.m.] 
3 BY-: 
4 Q I understand what you're saying. Maybe it would be helpful to watch the 
5 clip again, because our reading of what you said was that it was actually the opposite of 
6 the quote that you referenced. And that would be you're referring to struggles on both 
7 planes. 
8 And so we don't have to watch it again if there's nothing more you have to say on 
9 this, but I just want to be clear that what we are interested in is the fact that Stewart 
10 Rhodes advocated for a much more bloody civil war on your stage, and in an interview 
11 you gave the same day, you were talking about temporal struggles? 
12 A I never ever in my life advocated for violence. That goes against everything 
13 I believe in. So, no, that's --
14 Q Okay. 
15 A If in any way --sorry? 
16 Q Go ahead. Go ahead. 
17 A If in any way there's a temporal battle, it's for truth and justice to be shown 
18 in the audits. There's none of --nothing of the sort of any physical violence or anything 
19 that I would ever advocate for. 
20 
21 Q 
A So you would renounce any assertions of that? 
And we did, yes. Jericho March put out --no. Jericho March put 
22 out --after January 6th put out statements renouncing any and all violence, because that 
23 is not what Jericho March stood for. So there's --
24 
25 Q 
A But there was nothing --
That's not something that I would say.  62 
1 Q There's nothing before January 6th, because obviously in the days after 
2 December 12th there was a lot of coverage of Stewart Rhodes calling for civil war and the 
3 Oath Keepers organizing. There was no conversation about denouncing his speech then 
4 before January 6th? 
5 A I don't know what conversations others had. I wasn't part of conversations 
6 with people. 
7 Q Okay. Okay. Thank you. And there are a couple more points I have on 
8 the clip. 
9 You also say later on that people have died to preserve freedom and preserve our 
10 republic. So we are fighting to preserve our republic. And should I --can you walk me 
11 through what you mean by that as well? Is that similar to the last quote? 
12 A Again, that's the same fighting for election integrity. I think to interpret 
13 anything else would be a distortion. 
14 Q I'm just trying to get clarity. 
15 Did you anticipate that people were going to have to die to preserve freedom at 
16 this juncture in our history? 
17 A That's --no. I'm just saying that, as people often say, our Founders 
18 sacrificed so much for our Nation, so we should fight for election integrity to make sure 
19 we have free and fair elections and that our Nation remains a republic. That is what I'm 
20 saying. 
21 
22 Q 
A Understood. 
And to interpret just fighting as a physical, I think, is a distortion. That's 
23 why I mentioned what our Founding Fathers stood for and the sacrifices they made so we 
24 could have our freedoms. 
25 Q Were you concerned at this point that our country would not be a republic?  1 A My concern was that we would have free and fair elections. And if the 
2 audits showed that there was truth and justice, great. I just want to make sure that 
3 peoples' votes count. 
4 
5 Q 
A Uh-huh. 
And I think that that's a good thing for us to fight for to make sure that our 
6 votes --that America remains a democracy. And that's important. 
7 Q I have one more question on the content of the clip, and I believe that. 
8 - my colleague, has a few as well. 63 
9 Towards the end of what we showed, you said that the American public does not 
10 want communism, socialism, or globalism. 
11 Can you explain to me what you mean by globalism? 
12 Mr. Greim. You know,_ I think at this point we've gone far enough. 
13 mean, what does her belief about globalism possibly have to do --I mean, I'm sure she 
14 could answer all day about her political beliefs. What does that possibly have to do with 
15 passing legislation? 
16 I mean, I got to say we've gone on for a great length here. I hesitate to ever tell 
17 a witness not to answer in an interview, but we're really right on the edge here. I mean, 
18 so communism, the committee's okay with that. I forget the other word? 
19 
20 Mr. Brothers. Global. 
Mr. Greim. But globalism is now a trigger and now we need to find out about 
21 that. I think it's getting a little ridiculous. I mean, is this --
22 - So our goal is to just get better clarity on Ms. Grossu's statements. 
23 And as we mentioned earlier, there was some pretty heavy language that was used on 
24 the stage that's behind her in that clip. So we are trying to have some follow-up 
25 questions on that. And that's -- 1 
2 Mr. Greim. Okay. 
- If you do not want to answer that question, that's fine. We 
3 can --you can choose --we're in a voluntarily interview, you can choose not to answer 
4 that question and state so for the record. 
5 But when there are individuals who are now indicted for seditious conspiracy 64 
6 making those claims on the stage and we feel like it's our obligation to follow up on some 
7 things that we don't have clarity on that were made on that day. 
8 So feel free to say you do not want to answer, but that's where we're coming 
9 from. 
10 Mr. Greim. Yeah. I think we have to draw the line there. I mean, I'm sure she 
11 has an answer for it, but I mean, the fact that some --she says she did not hear the 
12 speeches. 
13 You know exactly what she said and it sounds like you're asking her what was in 
14 her mind and what was her concern when she said globalism, and that's no element of a 
15 seditious conspiracy claim against this person who's voluntarily testifying here. 
16 I mean, I hate to take more time to object to it than she would've taken by trying 
17 to answer. But, I mean, we've gone on for quite a while here about her own beliefs, 
18 about the election, about her faith. We've explained scripture. And I think asking her 
19 what she means by globalism is just a bridge too far. 
20 So I think she has to not answer. We have to draw kind of a line of principle. 
21 And if you want to --if the committee wants to subpoena her to say what she was 
22 thinking about with globalism, if there's a legislative purpose for that, then so be it, but I 
23 don't think there is. I think we'd have to fight that fight. 
24 I hope I don't --and I don't --I doubt you'll ask another question that triggers us 
25 today, but somehow we got to draw the line on that one.  65 
1 Ms. Grossu. And may I also just ask that if you try to draw the dots between 
2 what was said on stage versus what I did, I was, like I said, in and out of speeches. 
3 don't know at what point of the day that interview was taken. 
4 And so I don't think it's fair to me to try to draw the line --draw the dots between 
5 things that were said on stage versus things that I said in interviews just because, again, I 
6 was in and out of things and it should be taken independent of anything else. 
7 - This was an event that you organized with Mr. Weaver and Mr. 
8 Alexander. And so we understand that your involvement did not allow you to see every 
9 speech that was said on stage. But as I've asked a number of times about follow-up for 
10 Mr. Rhodes' speech or Mr. Flynn's speech or others, that is relevant to what we are asking 
11 about. 
12 And so if your speech was --sorry --your remarks in that interview occurred on 
13 the same day, it's a similar follow-up that we have to how you considered Mr. Rhodes' 
14 speech after the fact. 
15 And we're not trying to suggest that you're saying the same thing or that your 
16 remarks were coordinated. But this is an event that you organized. So the questions 
17 I'm asking of Mr. Rhodes have all been about your awareness and your reaction to his 
18 remarks at an event that you ran with Mr. Weaver. 
19 So if your answers are that you don't know, that's fine, but we're going to ask the 
20 questions. 
I think might have a question. 
BY 21 
22 
23 Q Ms. Grossu, I'm just curious, when did you become aware of Mr. Rhodes' 
24 speech? Because you said that you didn't hear it at the time. So I'd like to know when 
25 you became aware of the content of his speech.  66 
1 A I don't recall. There are speeches I still haven't watched, frankly. I have 
2 not watched the entire event from start to finish after the fact. 
3 
4 Q 
A Is today the first time that you're watching Mr. Rhodes' speech? 
No, not today. I think in preparation just to speak with you, I looked at it. 
5 That's the most recent time I recall. 
6 Q Okay. Well, if I organized an event, I would be pretty curious in news 
7 coverage of the event that I organized, and Mr. Rhodes' speech was covered in plenty of 
8 news outlets because he called for a bloody civil war. 
9 So I'm not sure I understand why more than a year later that's the first time that 
10 you're hearing of Mr. Rhodes' speech. 
11 Mr. Brothers. Is there a question there, counsel? I mean, she told you the first 
12 time she heard the speech. What you would've done if you would've planned an event 
13 seems pretty irrelevant to me. It doesn't seem like a fact question. 
14 
15 Okay. 
Ms. Grossu. So, I think --
16 It seems relevant that somebody who spoke on the stage that I 
17 organized is now indicted for seditious conspiracy for attempting to conduct an 
18 insurrection against the country. I would be pretty interested in what he said on my 
19 stage. 
20 So let me ask a question. Why does it take so long for you to review the content 
21 of a pretty well-covered speech on your own stage? 
22 Ms. Grossu. Honestly, last year with --what happened with January 6th was so 
23 scarring to me just in the backlash, especially the unfair, unjust backlash on Jericho 
24 March, that I just didn't really want to engage on those things anymore. 
25 And all I can go back to you is say, we set clearly the tone for the event. And  1 when people have a platform, you know, that's --they have their own independent 
2 thoughts and they could say that they're going to keep to what they're going to say or 
3 what are the rules, like what we're just talking about, planned. But at the end of the 
4 day, Mr. Rhodes is his own person and I can't control any of that. 
5 But, you know, we as just planners made it very clear to everyone involved what 
6 the event was about. And, you know, there were 50 --45, 50 speakers. There was a 
7 lot of praise and worship. There were a lot of pastors. There were a lot of really just 
8 anointed speeches. 
9 And if I, I would say, if I could do this again, I would not have partnered with --I 
10 would've asked Rob that there's --I don't want to do an event with Stop the Steal, and 
11 just kept it at just our prayer rally head. I think that that that's something that, in 
12 retrospect, it doesn't --it didn't add to our event. 
13 BY-: 
Do you believe the event was a success? 
I can't hear you. 
Do you believe the event was a success? 67 
14 
15 
16 
17 Q 
A 
Q 
A I believe that the event itself was very well attended; that overall there were 
18 a lot of people who, you know --so I'll tell you, my hope with even having people from 
19 Stop the Steal partnering was that they would actually be touched by the word of God 
20 and that their --that those people who may not have been religious would actually have 
21 some experience, a deeper experience of God. That was my hope for it, for the people 
22 who weren't part of, you know, just the Jericho March types that you'd expect to attend, 
23 which are the people who pray and stuff. 
24 So since it was a joint event, I was hoping that somehow that would rub off on 
25 people who maybe don't really care about the spiritual aspect.  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 Q Got it. So we can move on for now. 
So I wanted to move on to the aftermath of the December 12th event. 
You said you went home right after the event concluded? 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Yeah. Soon after, yes, I went home. 
So you didn't attend any other events that day? 
I did not. 
So that night there were some violent clashes in downtown D.C. involving 
8 Proud Boys and some other groups. When did you learn about this violence? 
9 A I don't recall. 
10 
11 
12 Q 
A 
Q Okay. 
I wasn't following everything that was happening at every moment. 
That was pretty prominent in news coverage later on. 68 
13 So my question was, did those reports, do you recall them making you concerned 
14 about having further events in D.C.? 
15 A You mean about us holding other events? 
16 Q Yes. 
17 A Well, obviously, we just wanted to make sure that people who were praying 
18 were safe. So we didn't have any other --I mean, I know we'll get to this --but we didn't 
19 have any other events like the staged event on December 12th. So I wasn't really 
20 thinking about concerns because there wasn't an event of like that sort planned. 
21 Q Got it. And we are going there now. 
22 So two days after the December 12th event, you mentioned this earlier, but the 
23 electoral college on December 14th voted and President Biden officially won under the 
24 electoral college system. 
25 So at that point, did you still think that the Jericho March mission to, as you said,  69 
1 find truth in the election was still a necessary one? 
A I think the prayer --we wanted to pray until --I don't know, just keep on 2 
3 
4 praying. 
deadline. We didn't have --it was kind of like a rolling thing. It wasn't --we didn't set a 
5 And, in fact, one thing about Jericho March, because these Jericho Walks were not 
6 just for election integrity, the goal was to continue praying and continue Jericho March 
7 for other issues, not just election integrity. 
8 So it was --people were still praying, people --yeah. So, and then, of course --I 
9 don't know. People just kept praying, and it was almost Christmastime, et cetera. 
10 Q Okay. So did you and Mr. Weaver have conversations about specific future 
11 events after December 12th? 
12 A Well, we did. And then, as you saw, that we had different self-led marches 
13 and things like that between January 2nd and 6th with some prayer vigils. I think at the 
14 State level there were still people gathering in different local locations and continuing 
15 praying as well. So that was still happening. 
16 Q So the events from January 2nd to 6th, those were ones that you had 
17 planned for D.C. or at least contemplated to have in D.C.? 
18 A Yes. Those were planned for D.C. in whatever way that others at the State 
19 level, people would join wherever they were locally, kind of join in spirit with us. 
20 Q And why did you pick those dates, January 2nd to January 6th? 
21 A I don't remember now. I know that, obviously, there were the holidays, so 
22 people were --you know, just Christmas, New Year's. And I don't know at what point it 
23 became clear that there was going to be an Ellipse rally. So we were just the prayer 
24 component. Our part was just to keep on praying. 
25 Q So, obviously, the certification of the electoral college vote was on  70 
1 January 6th in D.C. 
Right. 2 
3 A 
Q Did that have a bearing on your decision to seek to hold events during those 
4 days? 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Yeah. We wanted to keep on praying. 
And you saw January 6th as an important day? 
Right. Right. 
Can you walk me through why? 
That's when the certification would happen. So we just --that was our part 
10 of --we would just continue to pray. There was not much else to it. 
11 
12 Q , can we pull up exhibit 9? 
This is an email from Mr. Weaver to you on December 19th. Do you remember 
13 receiving this email? 
14 
15 A 
Q I mean, looking at it now and when you guys sent it. 
Okay. , can you scroll down to the next page? 
16 So this is, obviously, the tweet from President Trump that was sent on 
17 December 19th, and this is the first time that President Trump mentions that there will be 
18 a rally in D.C. on January 6th, and he says, quote/unquote, "Be there, will be wild!" 
19 
20 
21 tweet? 
22 
23 6th. 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A 
Q Uh-huh. 
Had you already decided to hold events in D.C. before this December 19th 
I don't remember the timeline of when we discussed January 2nd through 
Okay. can you scroll up again? 
So you see that Mr. Weaver writes, quote/unquote, "This is what we are dealing  1 with." 
2 Do you have any recollection of what he meant by that? 
3 
4 
5 
6 A I don't. 
Q Okay. 
A I don't know what he meant by that. 
Q And the fact that he's flagging that Trump had called for a protest on 1/6, 
7 you don't recall if that came before or after you also planned for marches on the 6th? 
A I don't recall. I don't recall where we were talking about marches --
Q Okay. 
A --in relation to that. 71 
8 
9 
10 
11 Q if you could bring up exhibit 20 now. Thank you. So if you 
12 can scroll down just a little bit. 
13 So this is an archived page from the Jericho March website. 
14 
15 A Uh-huh. 
Q And this is from around the time January 6th. So you can see very 
16 prominently is a picture of President Trump and the words from his tweet, "Be there, will 
17 be wild!", are in the slogan. 
18 So I know you've emphasized throughout this interview that your hope and 
19 expectations for Jericho March events were that they would be peaceful and unifying and 
20 joyous and prayerful. I'm wondering why you chose to put Mr. Trump's statement, "Be 
21 there, will be wild!", to advertise the event. How did that fit in with what you were 
22 trying to accomplish? 
23 A Well, I didn't choose that graphic or anything like that, so I didn't really --I 
24 didn't choose that. I don't know who put that together. But obviously it was a quote 
25 from Trump about the January 6th --his tweet, the "Be there, will be wild!", was just from  72 
1 his tweet. And I think we had different --maybe even different images in there at 
2 different times. 
3 Q Okay. That's helpful. 
4 Did you have any conversations with Mr. Weaver or anyone else about the 
5 decision to reference President Trump's tweet in your organization's advertisements? 
6 
7 A 
Q I don't recall having a conversation about that. 
Okay. So I'd like to now discuss in a little more detail --and, 
8 you can take this down --a little more details the events you had planned for that time 
9 period up to and including January 6th. 
10 So you mentioned that you had a number of events planned. And, generally, 
11 what was the overview of your hope for those events? 
12 A It was just --I know you have this also in your --but it was just doing self-led 
13 Jericho Marches from January 2nd to the 6th. And then there were prayer vigils just to 
14 pray for everyone involved just, obviously, just pray for all the Members, pray for the 
15 President, pray for everybody. 
16 It was just --and there was really --because they were self-led, it was just 
17 whoever was in D.C. could join. But it was not --it was not an organized --there was no 
18 itinerary --I mean, there was no schedule to those, to each day's specific event, except, of 
19 course, we were supposed to have an event on the 6th. We can go into that, too. 
20 Q And we'll get to that. 
21 A But because of how chaotic things were there, it didn't actually happen the 
22 way it was supposed to. It just didn't --it just kind of fizzled. 
23 Q Well, I'm definitely curious to hear more about that and we'll get to that. 
24 These events, were they coordinated in the same way with Ali Alexander and Stop 
25 the Steal as December 12th was?  1 A I don't recall that. I mean, right now I'm just looking at an ad and it was 
2 just our name on it. I'm not sure if any of the other ones had any cosponsors. 
3 But these were just prayers, so I don't think so. These weren't --there were 
4 no --there were no speakers or anything. It was just people who wanted to come and 
5 pray. 
6 Q And during this period, did you have any contact with anyone from the 
7 Trump administration? 
I did not. 
And the Trump campaign? 
No. 
Okay. 
Not that I recall of any. 
Do you remember if Mr. Weaver made any contact with them? 
I don't know. You'd have to ask him. 
Okay. How about your contacts with Roger Stone? 
I'm sorry. With whom? 
Did you have any contacts with Roger Stone in this time period? 73 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A I don't think so. He was --I think he was at an --I don't know which event 
19 he was at, if he was at the 5th or not. There was some other event going on, but I --not 
20 personal, no. 
21 
22 
23 Q 
A 
Q And how about Michael Flynn? 
No, I don't have contacts with him. 
Okay. And, again, you didn't have any contact with Stewart Rhodes in the 
24 lead-up to January 6th? 
25 A No.  74 
1 Q Okay. Did you have a role in any other events as they are being planned, 
2 like the rally at the Ellipse or events on January 6th? 
3 A I didn't have a role at the Ellipse at all. I was supposed to speak as the 
4 Jericho March person on the stage of Stop the Steal, but that never happened, one, 
5 because I couldn't find --they moved locations; and, two, my understanding from just like 
6 public records, that that didn't even actually happen, that their event. 
7 So I was supposed to speak and I was supposed to speak on Jericho March stuff, 
8 but I never --that never actually happened. 
9 
10 Q And why didn't it happen? 
A As I mentioned, I was trying to find the location, and because of how chaotic 
11 things were, they had moved locations. So I went to try to find the location and I never 
12 ended up finding the location. 
13 
14 
15 Q Okay. So that's all. And, sorry, was this January 5th or January 6th? 
A The 6th. 
Q This is the 6th. So you were supposed to speak on the Stop the Steal stage 
16 on the 6th? 
17 
18 
19 
20 A Yeah. I never found them. 
Q Okay. 
A I couldn't find them. 
Q How about Mr. Weaver? Do you know if he had any role in events planned 
21 for the 5th or 6th? 
22 
23 
24 
25 A You mean just besides the Jericho March events? 
Q Yes. Like, was he supposed to speak at any of these? 
A He was supposed to speak on the same stage on the 6th. 
Q Okay. Okay. That's helpful.  75 
1 At this point --and we are making progress, so thank you for bearing with me. 
2 can we bring up exhibit 18? 
3 So this is an email that was sent from Mr. Weaver to you and Stephen Brown. 
4 And my first question is, what was Stephen Brown's role in coordinating these later 
5 events, at least as they were contemplated? 
6 A I don't think he had a role. What he's saying there is people are asking him 
7 if there's anything planned. 
8 Q Uh-huh. Okay. That seems to be what it said. I just wanted to clarify. 
9 And you mentioned this earlier, but why were folks telling you they wanted to get 
10 to D.C. starting the 2nd? 
11 A Well, that is actually Rob speaking there: "Many wanted to march starting 
12 the 2nd." 
13 I think that once --I can't --I'm not going to speak for Rob, but --so I'm not going 
14 to speak for him. I think people once in general found out about Trump speaking, 
15 people wanted to be in D.C. 
16 So I don't know. I can't speak for why people want to be in D.C. They probably 
17 just wanted to hear him speak. 
Q That makes sense. All right. 18 
19 
20 So when you were getting closer to the events themselves, obviously there was a 
lot of coverage about --thank you, --there was a lot of coverage about the 
21 potential for clashes at the event. 
22 And so I'm curious, given what happened the night of the 12th, did you have any 
23 concerns about the security of events that you were planning to hold in D.C. in early 
24 January? 
25 A I wasn't really following those things. I think that the same thing  76 
1 throughout Jericho March was to make sure that our planned events were safe. So that 
2 was --that was just --it was more to protect the people who were participating in the 
3 prayer walks from --
4 
5 
6 
7 Q 
A 
Q 
A Was there any security that was hired? 
I'm sorry? 
Was there any security that was hired for those events? 
Well, the self-led ones were self-led. I don't recall --so I don't recall 
8 whether there was anything --well, so, we didn't actually have --besides the prayer vigil a 
9 lot --so there were events that were not ours on the 5th. So, obviously, that was 
10 not --everything else was the self-led. No, there was nothing --self-led people take 
11 their own just kind of responsibility for being safe and everything. 
12 And I think it was more of whether or not --like, for what we thought was going to 
13 be what we did on the 5th and the 6th, whether or not we would have people there in 
14 terms of security for those marches, because those were marches, one --the 
15 5th --January 5th was supposed to be a march around the Supreme Court, and that didn't 
16 happen because there was something going on at the Supreme Court, so they wouldn't 
17 let people march. 
18 So we actually ended up doing the prayer walk around the Capitol on the 5th and 
19 we did that maybe --we encircled it maybe, like, the whole seven times or close to it, 
20 doing prayers with the group. 
21 So that's when a march actually happened that was on the 5th. The 6th was 
22 chaotic and so --
Q if we could pull up exhibit 10. 23 
24 It's a number of emails and there's the issue of a security threat that was 
25 reported. We can get to that in a second, but I just wanted to talk through the schedule  77 
1 a little bit more. 
2 And that's on page 3 when you have a chance to have it up, 
3 And also we can get through a couple of more questions and then hopefully we 
4 can take a break, because I know we've been going for over an hour now? 
5 A Okay. 
6 Q And one last segment. 
7 A Yeah. Okay. Well, while we figure that out --
8 Sorry,-. Which number did you say? 
9 - Oh, it's exhibit 10. And page 3, it says the schedule for the Jericho 
10 March. 
11 
12 Awesome. Thank you. Thank you, 
Ms. Grossu. Yeah. There you have all those different people who --well, not 
13 necessarily that there were cosponsored, but that there were different events listed in 
14 there. 
15 BY-: 
16 Q All right. So this does not mean that there was --the framing of Save Our 
17 Republic, that umbrella, the lineup of events, was not meant to be a formal coalition like 
18 it was for December 12th where there was a joint event? 
19 A No. People --so I would say our self-led marches were just Jericho March 
20 stuff. It says "events by." It doesn't say, like, "sponsored." "Events by." And then 
21 there's different events that Stop the Steal, you know, have in there or, I don't know, the 
22 Moms for America one, et cetera. 
23 So anyway, it was --we just put all the different events that were going on in that 
24 time frame on one sheet. 
25 Q Okay. That's helpful. So, yeah, that's helpful clarity.  78 
1 You can see that on January 6th, and I don't know if it's large enough, but at 11:45 
2 a.m. there is that mention of the guided march around the U.S. Capitol. 
3 
4 A 
Q 
5 happen? 
6 A Yeah. 
And so it's my understanding, based on what you've said, that event didn't 
So because Trump's speech went so long, we --it was supposed to start at 
7 11:45 or noon, and we put out tweets and things to say it's pushed to 1 p.m. because his 
8 speech was going long. 
9 So then, basically, it got switched last minute like that to 1. And then I was still 
10 at the Ellipse at 1. Rob was not there that day. He was --I think he was in his hotel 
11 room with some back or something, some issue with --health issue. 
12 So neither of us could be there even at 1. And I was --we were just texting 
13 about, can there be somebody on the ground who maybe can, at least, start the prayers? 
14 Got connected with somebody there. 
15 And I ended up not even making it to --and she --she got back and said, there 
16 were about ten people and it's not what --it didn't go --like, it didn't quite happen. 
17 Maybe people made it around three times, but it didn't quite happen, and that was that. 
18 So by that time, it had already dispersed, those few people who showed up at the 
19 new time, and so I didn't actually get to go to any of that. 
20 And, again, it wasn't --actually, on the 5th, it was more like 25 people or 
21 something showed up and prayed seven times around the Capitol the whole time. That 
22 never actually happened on the 6th, as you can imagine. It was just chaotic and they 
23 just dispersed. 
24 Q So who was --and that's --that is good context to understand what 
25 happened. Who was the point of contact that you had who was trying to start it up at  79 
1 1 p.m.? 
2 A I think at one point Rob connected me to some woman by the name of 
3 Becca and said: Just started. It's okay. It just started. And I was trying to say: I'll 
4 get there as soon as I can, but I'm still here at the Ellipse. He's not done yet. 
5 
6 
7 
8 Q 
A Do you recall at all her last name or no? 
No. 
Q Okay. That's fine. 
And if you could explain to me a little more about what the perimeter of that 
9 event was supposed to look like? Maybe you did the same march on the 5th that was 
10 planned for the 6th. So give me a sense of where you were planning to march? 
11 A Well, from the 5th, it was just basically the large perimeter. Obviously, on 
12 the 5th, everything was blocked off, and so the people marching marched where people 
13 could walk, where it was permitted to walk. 
14 So on the 5th, people marched around the Capitol and prayed where they were 
15 supposed to be. So that was the intent and the hope for the 6th. No one 
16 would've ever imagined that the 6th would have been what it was. That's certainly not 
17 what we imagined. And so, obviously, it didn't happen like that. 
18 Q Okay. And then on the 6th, do you know where those individuals marched, 
19 if it was the same perimeter around the block or was it closer to the Capitol? 
20 A No, I don't know. They met at whatever meeting corner there. That 
21 was --I think that's where they met. I wasn't there. Like I said, they tried praying, and 
22 then it was just too chaotic, so they just dispersed. 
23 
24 
25 Q Okay. Did you ever make it to the Capitol that day on the 6th? 
A Yes, I did. 
Q About what time?  80 
1 A I made it to the Reflecting Pool around maybe 2:10, 2:05, 2:10. So that 
2 was --I was delayed because I was still at the Ellipse. 
3 Q And what happened when you got there? 
4 A Again, I was trying to find the location of the stage for the Stop the Steal 
5 event to speak. 
6 Q Okay. Got it. Well, that's skipping ahead a little bit, so we can get to that 
7 later. 
8 We can take a break in a moment, but I just have a couple of broader questions 
9 about the Jericho March --thank you, --about the Jericho March that was 
10 planned for the 6th. And we obviously talked earlier about what the Jericho March is 
11 and what it means and the symbolism there. 
12 So I'm curious about why you chose to hold it around the Capitol as the vote was 
13 planned to certify the electoral college. Was there thinking behind that? 
14 A It was just to pray for the people inside. It was just that there were big 
15 decisions being made and we're just praying. That's why. 
16 Q So in your figuring, it wasn't at all intended to impact the election outcome 
17 or the certification? 
18 A Well, we were just doing a spiritual prayer for everyone involved. Just, I 
19 mean, let God be God and whatever the outcome is whatever the outcome is. 
20 But we were out there just exercising our First Amendment rights to pray. And 
21 we were praying for elected officials, we were praying for our Nation. That was our 
22 mission from day one. 
23 Q Understood. And my last question is for the 5th or the 6th, both those 
24 events. Did you ever have any communication with law enforcement about those plans 
25 or any permits of any kind or were you just marching around the perimeter?  81 
1 A I personally was not. I don't know if Rob or --I don't know if Stephen was 
2 involved at all in this part. I don't know. We didn't have a stage or a spot, so I don't 
3 anticipate that that was necessary because it was just a public area for everyone to be in. 
4 There was no event that we --there was no stage or something. 
5 So I don't think so, but you can ask him too. I don't know. 
6 Q Thank you. I know if we could just --can we go off the record for a second 
7 actually? We can go off the record at 4:59. 
8 [Recess.] 
9 - Let's go back on the record at 5:06. And going to try to get through 
10 this quickly and efficiently. 
11 BY-: 
12 Q So right now we're looking at exhibit 11, which is part of the email chain that 
13 you and Mr. Weaver had about threats. That's also exhibit 10. 
14 
15 A 
Q Can you please make it a little bigger? I can't see it. 
Sure. So I can ask about threats in a second, but first I wanted to ask, 
16 you --or Rob sent you an email saying in the second paragraph: "I'm trying to get the 
17 info done and out for Sidney that she asked us to spearhead." 
18 Who is the Sidney in reference, who is that in reference to? 
19 
20 
21 
22 A 
Q 
A 
Q I don't know. You'd have to ask Rob. 
Is it Sidney Powell? 
I think you should just ask him. 
Okay. He said that this woman Sidney had asked you, both of you --he 
23 used the word "us" --to spearhead some info. So I guess I'll ask again if you have any 
24 recollection of who that might be. 
25 A I don't recall what this was about.  82 
Okay. 1 
2 Q 
A And by "us," I don't even know if that means us or Jericho March or who the 
3 "us" is, like if it's --what it's a reference to. 
Q Okay. So if you could scroll down, Keep scrolling. 4 
5 So this is a message that you received --scroll up a little bit --this is a message you 
6 received and you can read it. It says, "I will be there and my arrival's not going to be a 
7 weak victim like so many of you are. I'll be heavily armed." Mention of the "traitor 
8 McConnell." 
9 Were you concerned when you got this message? 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Yes, very concerned. 
And I could see you said that this needs to be reported. 
Yes. 
Did you ever hear anything back from law enforcement? 
Well, I wasn't the one --so I flagged Rob on it and he took care of it. So he 
15 was the one in touch with law enforcement. I don't recall, I don't know if he ever heard 
16 back from law enforcement. 
17 But certainly, you know, this type of email would be concerning, and I think we 
18 took the correct action to make sure that law enforcement was aware of this. 
19 Q Yes. More interested if you had heard back from law enforcement, but it 
20 doesn't seem like you would've known. 
21 A I don't know. I didn't hear back because I was not in touch with them, so I 
22 don't know if he ever did or if they ever got back to him. 
23 
24 
25 Q 
A 
Q Okay. And just to clarify, was Mr. Weaver in D.C. around January 6th? 
Yes. 
Okay.  1 
2 
3 A 
Q 
A Yes. 
But he was in his hotel room on the day of the 6th itself? 
On the 6th, I believe he was in the hotel room. On the 5th, we did that 
4 march together around the Capitol. 
5 Q Okay. And we talked about this before, but were you aware of any 
6 communications that Mr. Weaver was having with Stewart Rhodes or the Oath Keepers 
7 about trips to D.C. on the 6th time frame? 
8 
9 
10 A 
Q No, I was not aware of any communications. 
can you pull up exhibit 13? 
So this is a group chat that is Oath Keepers security for D.C. on January 5th and 
11 6th. And the title is cut off, but it also is "VIP attendees on the event." 83 
12 And you can see towards the bottom of the screen, Mr. Weaver is in the chat and 
13 he's asking the group chat, questions Mr. Rhodes at the top of the screenshot. 
14 You had no awareness that he was on this group chat? 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q No. 
Okay. Were you ever in any such chats for security? 
No. 
Okay. 
Not that --no, not that I recall. 
Okay. Well, Ms. Grossu, we're going to skip around a little bit, so apologies 
21 if we're a little bit frazzled. We're trying to get you out of here on time. 
22 can you pull up exhibit 21? 
23 I guess in the meantime, Ms. Grossu, at what point did you become aware of 
24 violence at the Capitol on January 6th? 
25 A I became aware of it sometime that afternoon because people were calling  84 
1 me asking me if I was okay. And I said: What do you mean? What do you mean am I 
2 okay? Yeah, I'm okay. What's going on? 
3

6 So what's interesting is I didn't even know about that until I actually got calls. 
Q Okay. Were you in D.C. at that time still? 
A Yes. 
Q So this is exhibit 21 and it's an archived tweet from the Jericho March 
7 account that was posted at 6:36 p.m., so in the early evening of January 6th --
8 
9 A Right. 
Q --after the event concluded. And for the record the tweet says: "You 
10 won't see this on the fake news, but here is what patriots looked like --singing patriotic 
11 songs, praying, and chanting USA. Here they are singing God Bless America," with an 
12 American flag emoji. 
13 My first question, who posted this tweet? 
14 A I don't recall if it was me, Rob, or someone else, because different people 
15 had access to it. 
16 
17 
18 
19 Q Okay. Who took this picture? 
A I don't know. 
Q Were you --is it one of your pictures? 
A I don't know. I'd have to go back and see. You guys have access to them 
20 as well, but --
21 Q Well, we haven't been able to [inaudible] so we haven't seen any of them 
22 yet. But you don't remember? Could this have been a picture you took? 
23 
24 
25 A It could have been. Yes, it could have been. 
Q So you were that close to the West Front of the Capitol? 
A Yes.  85 
1 
2 [5:13 p.m.] 
3 BY 
4 Q Did you ever see any violence between law enforcement and protesters? 
5 You were there around 2:00 p.m., as we discussed earlier. 
6 A I didn't see violence between them. I did see --I did see the riot police 
7 come out, but I didn't see any actual violence. 
8 
9 Q Okay. 
So can you walk us through what is meant by this tweet that was posted by your 
10 organization? Who are you referring to as "patriots" here? 
11 A So --well, I don't know if --I'm speaking on behalf of the Jericho March 
12 Twitter page here. 
13 By 6:30 p.m., of course, you know, people were --all the news and stuff came out 
14 about all the stuff that happened inside. And the patriots out there were just standing 
15 and singing and praying. They weren't --they weren't rushing the Capitol. They were 
16 just the same people who were at the Ellipse rally who are just there, and even --and 
17 even with kids, were just standing and --
18 
19 
20 Q 
A 
Q Right. So --
--with American flags. 
--in this picture, you can see people who are on the scaffolding and 
21 completely covering the steps of the Capitol. So I'm curious about the inclusion of those 
22 folks. Because this picture was taken on the west front of the Capitol, where the initial 
23 breach occurred, which at that point was all over the news by 6:36 p.m. 
24 So can you speak to the choice to include a picture of folks who were on the 
25 scaffolding for the inauguration, on the steps of the Capitol, all the way up to the  86 
1 entrance? 
2 A I mean, I --I think this tweet was in reference to the fact that people were 
3 just standing and chanting and praying. 
4 Q So the account says, "You won't see this on the fake news." At that point, 
5 obviously, there was a lot of coverage of what had happened at the Capitol. 
6 Was it your understanding, the Jericho March's understanding, that the coverage 
7 of the attack was fake news? 
8 A So it's --1 think that the media did not represent that day correctly. 
9 Obviously, there was the terrible, you know, break-in and all of that, which Jericho March 
10 and myself have roundly denounced. But what the media failed to show is, I would say 
11 there were probably a million or two people who were just being peaceful, singing 
12 patriotic songs, standing there. 
13 And so it was --it was a --it was a commentary on the fact that whatever small 
14 portion who wrongly did that by going in was not represented by all the other people 
15 who just were standing. 
16 
17 Q Right. 
Again --and you can see exhibit 22 on the screen now. Again, as a video --and I 
18 take your point that you are emphasizing the national anthem, but you can clearly see 
19 that there are individuals on the scaffolding that is planned for the inauguration in a few 
20 days, and people in the background you can see on the steps of the Capitol, up to and 
21 including the point where there was that initial breach on the Senate side. 
22 So I'm a little confused about why you would've posted both these tweets when 
23 this is a visualization of the crowd that eventually did go into the Capitol. 
24 A Well, that's --that's actually --that's not --so, one, this is a comment on the 
25 patriots singing the national anthem. It was not a comment on any of the background.  87 
1 It was a comment on what was happening right there in the close shot, which was people 
2 singing. 
3 But to say that a million or two people entered the Capitol is incorrect. So the 
4 patriots who --the people who were standing outside were just people standing outside, 
5 which was the 99 percent of --99.9 percent of the people. I don't know exactly what 
6 percent of people, but how many people --like, I don't know how many--400 people 
7 went in? Who knows? I don't --I have no idea. 
8 Q Just to be clear, though, Ms. Grossu, the actual frame of the images that we 
9 are showing you have folks on scaffolding and going up into the Capitol. So on this --
10 A This Jericho March tweet is just about people singing the national anthem in 
11 the forefront. 
Q Okay. 12 
13 Mr. Greim. Okay. And I'm going to step in here now. This is Mr. Greim. 
14 I mean, - you've --I have not been to another interview --we've done 
15 many, many --where this kind of questioning has happened. The picture does not show 
16 people going up the steps into the Capitol. It absolutely does not show that. And that 
17 is not --the witness has been very clear that that is not the representation. 
18 So I understand the committee can do its report and it can say that --maybe, you 
19 know, there will be some kind of a spin that Jericho March, you know, glorified people 
20 charging into the Capitol, but that is not at all what is depicted here. The witness has 
21 been very clear. 
22 And these questions where you embed the facts and then ask a different question, 
23 they're not information-gathering questions. They're the kind of thing that you might 
24 see in the cross-examination at a jury trial, but not in a fact interview for legislative 
25 purposes.  88 
1 - I want to be very clear that the individuals in these pictures are on top 
2 of scaffolding and are scaling the steps of the Capitol. That is not something that we are 
3 restating. That is what's in these images. 
4 So I'm asking about the decision to post these images and praise these images, 
5 which are inclusive of the events that led to arrests and police lines being broken on that 
6 day. 
7 Mr. Greim. No, absolutely not. The pictures are not --she has given her 
8 comment on this, and we're not going to answer any more argumentative questions 
9 about her views about the pictures. We're just not going to. 
10 - People in these pictures are actively breaking the law by being on the 
11 platforms. And in the last exhibit, exhibit 21, there are individuals that have broken 
12 through police lines scaling the steps of the Capitol. 
13 So, there's been images of folks who were not doing that. And we were asking 
14 about the Jericho March's decision to post images of folks who were doing that after 
15 images and videos of the breach had gone more than viral. 
16 So we can move on. 
17 if we can bring up exhibit 19? 
18 BY-: 
19 Q So this is, I believe, about a press release that was issued by the Jericho 
20 March after the attack on the Congress on January 6th. I have a few questions on this. 
21 
22 
23 
24 So did you have a conversation with Mr. Weaver about this email? 
A 
Q 
A Well--
Go ahead. 
Well, Jericho March put out a statement which is on the website and is very 
25 clear as to Jericho March's position on what happened on January 6th. So I think these  1 are just probably emails back and forth about wording and what our statement should 
2 say. 
3 
4 Q Okay. 
So, on that, Mr. Weaver writes that "we do not want the word 'riots' in this 
5 statement. Can you please change this to 'protests' for the official?" I'm assuming 
6 that means the official version of the release. 
7 Is that a reference to the events at the Capitol on January 6th? 
8 
9 
10 A 
Q 
A I mean, you have to ask him. 
Well, he uses the word "we" there, so I'm asking you. 
Well, he is the one who wrote that email, so --did you guys read the 
11 mission --the --
12 
13 
14 Q 
A 
Q We did. And now I'm asking about -­
--statements? 
--if you had a conversation with Mr. Weaver about changing the reference 
15 to January 6th from "riots" to "protests." 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A I don't recall having that conversation. 
So he said this without your authorization, said these are the terms we --
1 just said I don't recall. I don't recall having that conversation with him. 
Okay. 
And, actually, that was January 12th, so that was after the --we issued two 89 
21 statements, one on January 8th and one on January 14th. So I'm guessing that has to do 
22 with something about the January 14th statement. 
23 Q Okay. So I was asking you if the reference to "riots," which you want 
24 changed to "protests," if that has to do with the 6th or something else. 
25 Mr. Greim. Well, right now,_ you said --you asked the question if she  1 wanted to change it, but she just told you that she doesn't recall having that statement. 
2 
3 
4 - Right. 
Mr. Greim. I just want to be clear here. 
- Mr. Weaver used the term "we." So did he use that erroneously? 90 
5 Or if you don't recall those conversations, that's fine. I just wanted to be clear that, if it 
6 pertained to the January 14th statement, we'd still be interested in why there was that 
7 choice to change the --request to change the wording. 
8 BY-: 
9 
10 Q 
A But if you don't have any visibility into that, that's all right. 
And I'm not sure --you'd have to ask him what he meant by "we." Did he 
11 mean we as Jericho March, as a whole? I think that you just implying that it's me and 
12 him is not --
13 
14 Q 
A Well, I was hoping --
He's just saying, we do not want --we --and he may have been referring to 
15 Jericho March as an organization. I don't know. You have to ask him what his intent 
16 was in saying that. 
17 
18 Q can you scroll up? 
Right. I just want the record to reflect that you and Mr. Weaver are both on this 
19 email. So we can move on. 
20 Have you ever had any conversations with law enforcement about any activities 
21 on January 6th? 
22 
23 A 
Q No, not that I can recall. 
Okay. 
24 And before I ask some broader questions to close out, but is there anything that 
25 we should've been asking you during this interview that we didn't?  1 
2 
3 A No. 
Q Okay. 
All right. And, , can we bring up exhibit 6? 
4 So, if you can scroll down to the bottom --I guess I'm --first of all, as a baseline 
5 question, can you explain what this document is? 
6 
7 
8 A This is the script to the 3-minute video. 
Q Okay. What 3-minute video? 
A There was a 3-minute video with this script about --it was, like, a 
9 promotional video. 
Q Okay. Where was it shown? 
A It was on the website. 
Q Okay. 
A It was --yeah, it was on the website. 
Q Did you write this? 
A Sorry? 
Q Did you --is this a script you wrote? 91 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 A It was just a joint script that --I don't know who all had a chance at editing it 
18 and all of that. But it was something that Rob, myself, and --I don't know if there was 
19 other people who also inputted in it. We were working with, you know, just a 
20 videographer to come up with, you know, the content. 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 Q Okay. 
Can we scroll down to the end, 
So these edits here, do you remember who suggested them? 
A Yes. Those are my edits. 
Q Okay. Thank you. That's helpful.  92 
1 So I'm curious, on the second bullet point, one of your suggested edits is to add in 
2 footage from Black Lives Matter fire/riots. 
3 
4 A 
Q Uh-huh. 
And another, the fourth bullet point is to put in Black Lives Matter footage. 
5 And we talked a lot about the Jericho March being a search for truth and unifying. 
6 What was the relevance of images of those riots and those fires you were --
7 
8 
9 A 
Q 
A In the part --if you scroll up back to the script -­
Uh-huh. 
--the part, if you scroll back up, where it says, "America is under 
10 attack" --and, actually, wait. Oh, sorry. If you --the --let me see. 
11 The part with "the corrupt, disruptive forces" --essentially, that kind of --and right 
12 there --that kind of destruction on America, where people are burning things and 
13 destroying property, is everything --goes against everything America stands for. 
14 So the point was, these things are actually destructive of America, you know, and 
15 so that was --that was the intent. That was --and, again, showing that violence is 
16 destructive and against our foundation. 
17 Q So a lot of what we talked about was related to election integrity, as you 
18 termed it. Why was it important to tie those two messages together? 
19 A Well, if --obviously, as you recall, following --following, you know, the 
20 various rallies in D.C., there were --there were --there was violence, and that --that's 
21 uncalled for. 
22 I think that people should be able to peaceably use their First Amendment rights 
23 for peaceable --peaceful assembly. And, you know, it's --and it doesn't matter --I think 
24 any act of violence is completely wrong and should be denounced. And it doesn't 
25 matter if it's BLM or someone from any of those militia groups; I denounce and Jericho  93 
1 March denounces all acts of violence. 
2 And so, anyway, that was the intent. 
3 
4 Q 
A So I guess my question is, what does that have to do with election integrity? 
There were violent acts happening surrounding election integrity before 
5 January 6th where people were marching peacefully at the different rallies, et cetera. 
6 Q So the reference to BLM riots was not a reference to protests that had 
7 happened over the summer? 
8 A And also --and, yes, and that too. Those were all --those were all 
9 destructive to the fabric of America. 
10 
11 
12 
13 Q 
A 
Q 
A It sounds like --
So, yes. 
--that's part of your concern, and not just the election? 
I mean, you could see what the script says. It's --it has about election 
14 integrity but also all the other things that are destructive to the American fabric, of what 
15 the core values of what America stands for. 
16 Q So, I guess, what do you think the corrupt and destructive forces at work 
17 were? 
18 Mr. Greim. Now,--- this is Eddie Greim. I mean, I have to wonder what 
19 this has to do with the investigation. I mean, her belief about what's wrong with 
20 America, what's destroying America, I mean, we could sit here the rest of the day. 
21 guess --I don't want to take more time, because we've got to run, but --
22 
23 
24 - We're wrapping up. And I would -­
Mr. Greim. Okay. 
- --reiterate that House Resolution 503 talks about influencing factors 
25 of the attack, including what folks thought was relevant to the circumstance of the events  94 
1 leading up to the attack. 
2 And the December 12th event included a confluence of many figures who later 
3 participated in the attack or had other relevance to the investigation. So we are asking 
4 Ms. Grossu questions about what her views about this were. 
5 And these are the last couple of questions, and I wanted to give her a chance to 
6 sort of talk through her beliefs. So that's --
7 Mr. Greim. Oh, yeah, but that's---, her beliefs are exactly what is not what 
8 the investigation is for. I mean, it's not to probe the beliefs. You've said it yourself. 
9 
10 But, look, I guess, if this is the last question, then fine, but, I mean -­
- So I just want to be very clear: She decided to put together a 
11 platform for the very people who are at the center of the investigation. And we have an 
12 opportunity now to better understand --and I think this conversation that we were just 
13 having is a helpful one --to understand --
14 Ms. Grossu. We put a platform together for prayer. We put a prayer rally 
15 together. We did peaceful, prayerful rallies all around the country, you know, for days 
16 on end, weeks on end, from November through January. And --
17 
18 
19 - So, again, I'm --
Ms. Grossu. --and they were peaceful, and that was what we were about. 
And not only were we about that, but all of the Jericho Marches have been 
20 peaceful. That's what Jericho March stands for. We made that very clear in our 
21 statements. And it's just exercising First Amendment rights to pray together and 
22 peaceably assemble. 
23 BY-: 
24 Q I just want to be very clear that the leader of the Oath Keepers calling for the 
25 Insurrection Act to be invoked and potential civil war is not prayer. And so, that is the  95 
1 event that we've talked about for the majority of this interview. And so I just want to be 
2 clear on the record for that. 
3 If you want to answer the question about your thoughts, feel free to, but I'd also 
4 understand if you do not. 
5 A I think that the script is clear that --and you read, when you go through it 
6 again, there's only a few lines mentioned to --a line mentioned to the various ways that 
7 perhaps our Nation is --the fabric of our Nation is, you know, under attack, but it really, 
8 the rest of it, you can see, goes straight to the topic at hand, which is election integrity. 
9 And that is, you know, what drove the video. That's what drove even the prayer 
10 marches, was for election integrity. And, you know, that's what our First Amendment 
11 guarantees, that we can get together and pray and peaceably assemble. And that's 
12 what we --from day one, with the fliers, everything about our marches was peaceful. 
13 We can't --you know, we can't control, at the end of the day, who says what, 
14 especially when we already made it very clear what our events were about. So each 
15 person, you know, can say things. And, frankly, obviously, as I mentioned, that's not 
16 something that we ever were, you know, supportive of any violence, and as we made 
17 very clear in our statements. 
18 
19 Q Understood. 
You mentioned also that Jericho March was marching, had events for other causes 
20 that were not election integrity. Could you enlighten us as to what some of those were? 
21 Like, are those marches still ongoing? 
22 A Those never happened because, once Jericho March was slandered in the 
23 news --even though Jericho Marches have happened prior to Rob and I doing these for 
24 election integrity, and they're still happening, actually. Nothing of our plan, but people 
25 are praying around various things and issues even today.  1 But, you know, we had --we were focused on just doing the Jericho March for 
2 election integrity and, you know, deciding potentially other areas to pray about. 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 - Well, I don't think I have any other questions. I'm not sure if 
or have any questions? 
All right. It doesn't seem like they do. 
Ms. Grossu, is there anything else that you think we should ask about? 
Ms. Grossu. No. 
- Okay. 
Well, in that case, we can wrap up here. Again, I appreciate your cooperation 
10 today and appreciate you talking through some of these questions with us and the 
11 productions you've given. We'll follow up if we have any issues with getting that 
12 uploaded, and we'll be in touch. 
13 But thank you --96 
14 Ms. Grossu. And --yes. And I hope that, like, my willingness to, like, speak with 
15 you is --you know, just that I'm willing and --to be open, because I have --I don't have 
16 anything to hide. 
17 
18 
19 
20 - Yeah. Thank you. 
All right. Well, I appreciate your time. 
And we can go off the record at 5:38 p.m. 
[Whereupon, at 5:38 p.m., the interview was concluded.]  1
