2 It's 10:08 a.m. on March 10, 2022. And this is a deposition of 
3 General Michael Flynn, conducted by the House Select Committee to Investigate the 
4 January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol pursuant to House Resolution 503. 
5 At this time, I'd like to ask the witness to please state your full name and spell 
6 your last name for the record. 
7 
8 The Witness. Michael Thomas Flynn, F-1-y-n-n. 
- Thank you, General Flynn. 
9 And, Counsel, could you please introduce yourself and the others who are joining 
10 this Webex deposition. 
11 Mr. Warrington. Yes. David Warrington, counsel for General Flynn. That's 
12 W-a-r-r-i-n-g-t-o-n. With me by video are my colleagues Michael Columbo, 
13 C-o-1-u-m-b-o; Gary Lawkowski, L-a-w-k-o-w-s-k-i; and our legal assistant, Erin Potter, 
14 P-o-t-t-e-r. 
15 At this time, I'm going to ask that the official reporter swear you in, 
16 General Flynn. Can you please stand and raise your right hand? 4 
17 The Reporter. Do you solemnly declare and affirm, under the penalty of perjury, 
18 that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing 
19 but the truth? 
20 
21 
22 
23 The Witness. I do. 
Thank you, 
Thank you, General Flynn. 
So this will be a staff-led deposition. And if any members decide to join or ask 
24 questions, they may do so and will probably do so by turning on their camera, and I'll 
25 defer to them at that time.  5 
1 My name is-. I am a senior investigative counsel for the select 
2 committee. Also in the room today from the committee are 
3 She's sitting to my left. She's investigative counsel to the committee. To her left is 
4 _, committee parliamentarian. To my right is who's a 
5 professional staff member for the committee. 
6 And as I mentioned before we went on the record, there are a number of folks 
7 joining from the committee, and you can see them listed on the right-hand side of the 
8 screen in the Webex platform. 
9 Also joining us at this time are members of the select committee Zoe Lofgren and 
10 Liz Cheney. And if other members join, I will try to announce their presence as soon as I 
11 can note it. 
12 It's possible that other staff join as well. I do not plan to note their presence, but 
13 if there's a reason to, I'll do so for you, General Flynn. 
14 Under the House deposition rules, neither committee members nor staff may 
15 discuss the substance of your testimony that you provide today unless the committee 
16 approves its release. 
17 You and your attorneys will have an opportunity to review the transcript, and I will 
18 be in touch with Mr. Warrington about that. 
19 Before we begin, there are a few ground rules I want to make sure you 
20 understand. 
21 We do plan to follow the House deposition rules that we provided to your counsel 
22 previously. Under those rules, counsel for other persons or government agencies may 
23 not attend, and you are permitted to have your attorneys present. And we've noted 
24 their presence on the record. 
25 I will ask that you confirm that no other persons besides your attorneys are  1 attending or plan to attend this deposition today. Is that correct? 
2 
3 
4 Mr. Warrington. Yes, but General Flynn's wife is in the room we're in. 
Okay. Bear with me for one moment, please, Mr. Warrington. 
Mr. Warrington. Okay. 
5 [Discussion off the record.] 6 
6 Mr. Warrington and General Flynn, unfortunately, under the House 
7 deposition rules, these are private proceedings and we cannot have your wife join as part 
8 of the proceeding. 
9 So I'd ask that you be the only people in the room for the entirety of the 
10 proceeding. Do you understand that? Is that okay? 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 Mr. Warrington. Yes. Give us about 2 minutes, okay? 
Yep. Take your time. 
[Recess.] 
All right. Are we prepared to proceed? 
Mr. Warrington. We are prepared to proceed. 
All right. Very well. 
17 And I just ask that you also confirm, as we discussed before we went on the 
18 record, that you or nobody else is recording this proceeding or otherwise transmitting it 
19 as we proceed. 
20 Mr. Warrington. We are not. 
21 Thank you, Mr. Warrington. 
22 There is an official court reporter who's transcribing the record of this deposition. 
23 So, along those lines, please wait until each question is completed before you begin your 
24 response, General Flynn. And I, likewise, will do my very best to wait for you to finish 
25 your response until I start my next question.  7 
1 I'd also note that the court reporter cannot record nonverbal responses, such as 
2 shaking your head, so it is important that you answer each question with an audible and 
3 verbal response. 
4 We do ask that you provide complete answers based on your best recollection. 
5 If the question that I ask is not clear, please ask for clarification. If you do not know the 
6 answer, that's perfectly fine. Please say so. But you can only refuse to answer a 
7 question to preserve a privilege recognized by the select committee. 
8 If you refuse to answer a question based on a privilege, staff may either proceed 
9 with the deposition or seek a ruling from the chairman on the objection. And if the 
10 chairman overrules such an objection, then you will be required to answer the question. 
11 I also want to remind you that it is unlawful to deliberately provide false 
12 information to Congress. Since this deposition is under oath and you've now been 
13 sworn, providing false information could result in criminal penalties for perjury or 
14 providing false statements. 
15 Do you understand all the rules that we've just gone over? 
16 The Witness. I do. 
17 Thank you, General. 
18 And, logistically, just please let us know if you at any point need a break, either a 
19 comfort break or to discuss anything with your attorneys. 
20 And I'd just note that, in this type of scenario, it's best, if you need to consult with 
21 your attorney, to shut off your camera, as you just did, and shut off your microphone. 
22 That way, we won't be able to hear anything that you talk about with Mr. Warrington. 
23 With that, are you prepared to proceed? 
24 Mr. Warrington. -let me --I do want to interject with an objection on the 
25 grounds that, to the extent these rules conflict with constitutional rights of my client, we  8 
1 would note our objections to that on an ongoing basis, and also to the extent that the 
2 committee's activities or manner of conduct of this deposition does not comport with this 
3 House resolution. 
4 Thank you, Mr. Warrington. 
5 And it was cutting out just a little bit. I just want to confirm at this point that the 
6 court reporter was able to understand what Mr. Warrington said. 
7 [Reporter responds off-mike.] 
8 Mr. Warrington. All right. Let me try to increase the microphone. Give me a 
9 second here. 
Thank you. I appreciate that. 10 
11 Mr. Warrington. I adjusted the volume on the microphone level to the max. 
12 How is that? 
13 We'll proceed. And if the reporter has any issues, I'd just ask that 
14 they speak up. And we may need to have you repeat any answers that we can't 
15 understand. 
16 EXAMINATION 
17 BY 
18 Q We're going to show you some documents, General Flynn. We'll pull them 
19 up. Make sure you can see them on the screen. 
20 So let's go ahead and pull up exhibit No. 1, please. 
21 Are you able to see what we've just pulled up as exhibit No. 1, which should be a 
22 subpoena? 
23 
24 A 
Q Yes. 
All right. Do you understand, General Flynn, that you're appearing 
25 pursuant to the subpoena dated November 8, 2021, with the "To Michael Flynn" that's  1 shown as exhibit No. 1 on your screen? 
2 
3 
4 
5 A Yes. 
Q And is that you, Michael Flynn, the person who's named in the subpoena? 
A Yes. 
Q Okay. 
6 General Flynn, can you please --I'm going to go through your background, and I'll 
7 do so in order to not have it go too long, but I understand that you graduated from the 
8 University of Rhode Island in 1981. Is that correct? 
9 
10 
11 
12 A Yes. 
Q And you were in the Army from approximately 1981 to 2014. Is that right? 
A Yes. 
Q You did multiple tours at Fort Bragg with the 82nd Airborne Division, the 
13 Joint Special Operations Command, and others. Is that right? 
14 A Yes. 
15 Q You also served with the 25th Infantry Division at the Schofield Barracks in 
16 Hawaii. Is that correct? 
17 A Yes. 
18 Q You then served as the assistant chief of staff for the, I believe it's the XVIII 
19 Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, starting in approximately June 2001? 
20 
21 A Yes. 
Q And then you commanded the 111th Military Intelligence Brigade from June 
22 2002, roughly, to June 2004, and you were director of intelligence for the Joint Special 
23 Operations Command from July 2004 to June 2007. Is that correct? 
24 
25 A Yes. 
Q I understand that in June 2007 through July 2008 you served as the director 9  10 
1 of intelligence at the United States Central Command and as the director of intelligence of 
2 the Joint Staff from July 2008 to June 2009. Is that correct? 
3 
4 A Yes. 
Q In September 2011, you were promoted, I believe, to lieutenant general and 
5 assigned as assistant director of national intelligence at ODNI. Is that correct? 
6 
7 A Yes. 
Q And then in April 2012 President Obama nominated you to be the 18th 
8 Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, and you took command in approximately July 
9 2012. Is that also correct? 
10 
11 A Yes, I believe so. 
Q My understanding is you retired from DIA and the Army in August of 2014, 
12 correct? 
13 
14 A I retired in September. 
Q September, okay. Thank you, General. And, around that time, you 
15 started or joined the Flynn Intel Group, which is a company that provided intelligence 
16 services for businesses and governments. Is that right? 
17 
18 A Yes. 
Q I believe in or around February of 2016 you became an advisor to the 2016 
19 Presidential campaign of Donald Trump. Is that right? 
20 
21 A Yes. 
Q And then in November of 2016 you became a member of the transition team 
22 for then-President-elect Trump. Is that correct? 
23 
24 A Yes. 
Q And from January 2017 through February 2017 you served as the National 
25 Security Advisor to President Trump. Is that right?  11 
Yes. 1 
2 A 
Q After you left that, I believe you became chairman of America's Future, Inc., 
3 which is a 501{c)(3) nonprofit organization. Is that right? 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Yeah, but that's just recent --just recently. 
Okay. But you ultimately did become chairman of America's Future, Inc.? 
Yes. 
Roughly when was that? 
April --roughly April of 2021. 
And are you also associated with something called The America Project, 
10 which I believe Mr. Patrick Byrne has a role in? 
11 
12 A 
Q Yes. Yep. 
Okay. And did both of those, the America's Future, Inc., and The America 
13 Project, help to fund the Arizona Cyber Ninjas audit in Arizona? 
14 A If it's okay with the committee, I'm going to claim --at this point, on the 
15 advice of counsel, I'm going to assert my constitutional privilege under the Fifth 
16 Amendment and respectfully decline to answer the question. 
17 Q General Flynn, you have not produced any documents in response to the 
18 November 8th subpoena that we showed at exhibit No. 1. Why haven't you produced 
19 any documents to the select committee? 
20 A On the advice of counsel, I assert my constitutional privilege under the Fifth 
21 Amendment and respectfully decline to answer the question. 
22 And if it's okay with the committee, going forward, when I invoke my privilege 
23 under the Fifth, I can just say "the Fifth," if that's okay. 
24 Q That's perfectly fine, General Flynn. There may be certain questions where 
25 I ask you to clarify and announce the full reason, but, yes, that's perfectly fine moving  1 forward, generally. 
2 Just so I understand, going back to the question I just asked you, is it your 
3 position --
4 
5 Ms. Cheney. -
--that the act --yes, ma'am? 12 
6 Ms. Cheney. I'm sorry. We need to take a quick break. Can we take a break, 
7 please, and we'll be right back, and then I'll reach out to you. 
8 
9 
10 
11 Certainly. 
If we could go off the record very briefly. 
[Recess.] 
Let's go back on the record. It's 10:38 a.m. on March 10th, and 
12 we're resuming the deposition of General Michael Flynn. 
13 I understand you'd like to make a point on the record, Mr. Warrington? 
14 
15 Mr. Warrington. Yes,-· Thank you. 
Just so the committee is aware, we are in court, having filed the challenge, a 
16 motion to quash the subpoena. We are appearing at this deposition even though the 
17 case is still pending and that issue has not been decided on. We noticed that this 
18 hearing was going to go forward anyway, and that's why we're here. 
19 
20 
21 Q Thank you for that. So let's go ahead and proceed. 
BY 
General Flynn, did you use a Gmail account or a Proton Mail account for any 
22 communications related to the 2020 election? 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A The Fifth. 
I'm sorry, could you repeat that? 
On the advice of counsel, I assert my constitutional privilege under the Fifth  13 
1 Amendment and respectfully decline to answer the question. 
2 Q Okay. And that was relatively hard to hear. I did catch it, though. And, 
3 at this point, I do want to be very clear about the basis for your assertion. 
4 So, General Flynn, are you invoking your Fifth Amendment rights because a 
5 truthful answer may tend to incriminate you in a later criminal proceeding? 
6 Mr. Warrington. Counsel, we are not going to explain the basis for the privilege, 
7 because the basis for the privilege --explaining the basis of the privilege would defeat the 
8 purpose of the privilege. 
9 My understanding of the law, Mr. Warrington, is that a valid Fifth 
10 Amendment assertion is based on a truthful answer that may tend to incriminate a 
11 witness in a later criminal proceeding. I don't view that as necessarily admission or 
12 looking behind the privilege, just ensuring that, in fact, General Flynn is asserting it for the 
13 valid reason that providing such an answer would tend to incriminate him in a later 
14 criminal proceeding. 
15 Mr. Warrington. That's actually a misstatement of the law, Counsel. The Fifth 
16 Amendment in many court cases has been demonstrated by the court as held that it's 
17 there to protect the innocent from being ensnared in ambiguous circumstances for many 
18 reasons. 
19 But if you want to rely on the fact that General Flynn has read the Fifth 
20 Amendment and understands the text of the Fifth Amendment and is invoking his 
21 privilege consistent with that, with the Fifth Amendment, I think that he can answer that 
22 question. 
23 I'll just read for you the precise language of the Fifth Amendment. 
24 It's: "Nor shall any person be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against 
25 himself."  Is that the basis for which General Flynn is invoking his Fifth Amendment rights? 
The Witness. Yeah. Yes. 
BY 14 
1 
2 
3 
4 Q Okay. And I may ask you at various points, General Flynn, to acknowledge 
5 that. But I understand that there are certain questions here to which you are going to 
6 invoke the Fifth Amendment. 
7 General Flynn, did you use any other email accounts for any communications 
8 related to the 2020 election other than Gmail accounts or Proton Mail accounts? 
9 
10 A 
Q The Fifth. 
Did you send or receive any text messages related to the 2020 election using 
11 your personal cell phone device? 
12 
13 A 
Q The Fifth. 
Did you send or receive any messages related to the 2020 election using any 
14 encrypted messaging applications, such as Signal, WhatsApp, Wickr, or Telegram? 
15 
16 A 
Q The Fifth. 
Did you maintain any active social media accounts between November 3, 
17 2020, and January 20, 2021, including on Twitter, Facebook, Parler, lnstagram, or 
18 Linkedln? 
19 
20 A 
Q The Fifth. 
Did you send or receive any messages related to the 2020 election through 
21 social media, such as Twitter, Facebook, Parler, lnstagram, or Linkedln? 
22 
23 A 
Q 
24 computer? 
25 A The Fifth. 
Do you have any documents related to the 2020 election on a personal 
The Fifth.  1 Q Do you have any hard-copy documents related to the 2020 election in your 
2 custody, possession, or control? 
3 
4 A 
Q The Fifth. 
Do you have any documents related to the 2020 election on any computer 
5 server other than the places we've already asked you about? 
The Fifth. 15 
6 
7 A 
Q And just so I understand, I'll ask this again: Is it your position that the act of 
8 producing documents to the committee in response to the subpoena, as opposed to the 
9 content of the documents themselves, could tend to incriminate you? 
10 Mr. Warrington. Counsel, I will also note for the record that we have responded 
11 to the committee's request for documents --
12 
13 
14 I'm sorry, Mr. Warrington, you're cutting out. I can't hear you. 
Mr. Warrington. Okay. I'll try to get closer. 
I will also note for the record that we have responded to the committee's request 
15 for documents with correspondence with our objections to those. I'll offer to work with 
16 the committee to narrow the scope of the subpoena. And that we have also filed a 
17 motion to quash that subpoena, which is still pending in the Middle District of Florida. 
18 
19 Q And, to be clear, General Flynn, are you also asserting your Fifth Amendment 
20 rights to not produce documents to the committee pursuant to the subpoena? 
21 
22 A 
Q Yes. 
And is that because the act of producing documents would be incriminating 
23 in and of itself? 
24 Mr. Warrington. Counsel, I think, again, that goes back to a misstatement of the 
25 case law around the Fifth Amendment, and I don't think you want to ask him for a legal  1 conclusion. And what he's doing is on the advice of counsel. 
2 
3 Q BY 
So let me ask it this way: General Flynn, are you invoking your Fifth 
4 Amendment because producing --Amendment rights because producing documents 
5 would implicate your Fifth Amendment privileges, as opposed to the contents of those 
6 documents themselves? 
Yes. 16 
7 
8

3 Q This is a tweet from you on November 11, 2020. You quote-tweet a tweet

5 "#Breaking #BreakingNews 
6 "#Dominion instruction manual shows how to: 
7 "-Hack it's software 
8 "-Feed it 'test stacks' with only Biden marked 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 "-Can those be counted as legitimate results? YES. 
"-Were they? YES. 
"-Can Purge ENTIRE BATCHES of #Trump votes. 
"AND THEY DID ALL OF IT" 
Who is AOECOIN, General Flynn? 
A The Fifth. 
Q Did you know that, at least at the time, AOECOIN purported to be a power 
16 distribution company based in Cambodia? 
17 
18 A The Fifth. 
Q Did you, General Flynn, ever see any evidence that the Dominion instruction 
19 manual shows how to hack its software? 
20 
21 A The Fifth. 
Q Did you, General Flynn, ever see any evidence that the Dominion instruction

Q Did you ever see any evidence that the Dominion voting machines counted  31 
1 only Biden-marked ballots as showing as legitimate?

3 A 
Q Did you ever see any evidence that the Dominion instruction manual shows 
4 how entire batches of Trump votes can be purged?

6 A 
Q The Fifth. 
Did you ever see any evidence that the Dominion voting machines purged 
7 entire batches of Trump votes? 
8 
9 A 
Q The Fifth. 
Did you ever see any evidence that Dominion voting machines were 
10 manipulated in any way to affect the outcome of the 2020 election such that President 
11 Trump should have won? 
12 
13 A 
Q The Fifth. 
So, going back to this tweet at exhibit No. 5, you write, quote, "There has 
14 been a toll of blood & treasure that cost America to maintain our constitutional republic 
15 for almost 250 years. On this Veterans Day, we cannot allow this sacrifice to go in vain," 
16 unquote. 
17 In this tweet, you're invoking conflicts as far back as 1776 in the context of 
18 commentary related to the 2020 Presidential election. Is that right? 
19 
20 A 
Q The Fifth. 
What message, General Flynn, were you trying to communicate by invoking 
21 these conflicts and the related, quote, "toll of blood & treasure," unquote? 
22 
23 A 
Q The Fifth. 
What did you mean when you wrote that, quote, "we cannot allow this 
24 sacrifice to go in vain," unquote? 
25 A The Fifth.  1 Q General Flynn, what action were you recommending that people take in 
2 relation to the 2020 Presidential election with this tweet at exhibit 5? 
3 
4 A 
Q The Fifth. 
And are you invoking the Fifth Amendment to that question because a 
5 truthful answer would be compelling you to be a witness against yourself in a future 
6 criminal case, General Flynn? 32 
7 Mr. Warrington. Counsel, I would also note that none of the invocation of or the 
8 assertion of Fifth Amendment here does anything to constitute a waiver of any other 
9 applicable constitutional privileges that we assert in our pleadings, which in this case 
10 would also include the First Amendment. 
11 
12 Q So I'll ask you again --and I'm just going to read for you the language of the 
13 Fifth Amendment: "Nor shall any person be compelled in any criminal case to be a 
14 witness against himself." 
15 Is your answer to that question that I just asked you, about actions that you were 
16 recommending that people take in exhibit No. 5, is that the basis for claiming the Fifth? 
17 
18 A 
Q You'll have to repeat the question, because I missed part of it at the end. 
Of course. So the question to you, General Flynn, was: What actions 
19 were you recommending that people take with this tweet that you sent as shown in 
20 exhibit No. 5? 
21 
22 A 
Q The Fifth. And I was exerting my First Amendment privilege. 
And are you asserting the Fifth because providing a truthful answer would 
23 be compelling you to be a witness against yourself in any future criminal case, as that 
24 language shows up in the Fifth Amendment? 
25 Mr. Warrington. Counsel, I understand what you're trying to do here, but the  33 
1 text of the Constitution does not exist in a vacuum. The Fifth Amendment has a much 
2 broader application, has been well-developed with over 200-plus years of case law. 
3 He is not a lawyer. He is not a constitutional law professor. So he's asserted 
4 his Fifth Amendment privilege. I think that's as far as we need to go. 
5 And I'm just asking if he's doing so based on language in the Fifth 
6 Amendment of the United States Constitution. 
7 
8 Q Is that right, General Flynn? Is that the reason you are invoking your Fifth 
9 Amendment? 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Yes, on the advice of counsel. 
So yes, General Flynn? 
On the advice of counsel. 
On the advice of counsel what, General Flynn? 
I assert my constitutional privilege under the Fifth Amendment and 
15 respectfully decline to answer the question. 
16 
17 
18

13 
14 The Witness. The Fifth. 
Ms. Cheney. And are you aware, General Flynn, that Congress doesn't select the 
15 President, the States do, and every State in our Nation now selects the President through 
16 a popular vote? 
17 
18 The Witness. The Fifth. 
Ms. Cheney. And are you aware, General Flynn, that every State in our Nation 
19 identifies the manner in which disputes regarding the election are addressed under State 
20 law? 
21 
22 The Witness. The Fifth. 
Ms. Cheney. And, in each State, those laws set forth a process for challenging an 
23 election when concerns arise. And that process includes potential recounts or audits; it 
24 includes an opportunity to litigate disputed issues in court. 
25 Are you aware that that's our process under the Constitution, General Flynn?  38 
The Witness. The Fifth. 1 
2 Ms. Cheney. And are you aware, General Flynn, that when courts have resolved 
3 any election challenges and when the election result has been certified by the Governor 
4 of a State, the election's over? 
5 
6 
7 
8 The Witness. The Fifth. 
Ms. Cheney. Are you aware, General Flynn, that we are a Nation of laws? 
The Witness. The Fifth. 
Ms. Cheney. And, General Flynn, are you aware that that process that I just 
9 described, where States select the President and States set forth the manner in which any 
10 disputes regarding the election are resolved and that, when those disputes have been 
11 litigated and resolved and the election is over, that process is the rule of law? Are you 
12 aware of that, General Flynn? 
13 
14 The Witness. The Fifth. 
Ms. Cheney. General Flynn, are you aware that, in the 2020 election, the Trump 
15 campaign and associated entities filed over 60 lawsuits in State and Federal court? 
16 
17 The Witness. The Fifth. 
Ms. Cheney. And are you aware, General Flynn, that in at least 60 of 61 of those 
18 lawsuits the judges ruled against the Trump campaign? 
19 
20 The Witness. The Fifth. 
Ms. Cheney. And, General Flynn, some have said that the States --that the 
21 courts did not hear evidence. But are you aware, General Flynn, that in Nevada, for 
22 example, the judge said, "The Contestants failed to meet their burden to provide credible 
23 and relevant evidence to substantiate any of the grounds set forth" in which they're 
24 attempting to contest the November 3, 2020, general election? 
25 The Witness. The Fifth.  39 
1 Ms. Cheney. So, General Flynn, are you aware that in multiple of these cases 
2 judges, including judges appointed by President Trump himself, rejected the Trump 
3 campaign's claims that there had been fraud in the election? 
The Witness. The Fifth. 4 
5 Ms. Cheney. General Flynn --and I ask this with great respect, because I'm very 
6 aware of the tremendous service that you provided to this Nation, of the service that you 
7 provided in Iraq, in Afghanistan, around the world, helping identify and hunt down some 
8 of the most dangerous terrorists who've ever threatened the United States. 
9 So I wonder, General Flynn, how it could be that you went from that kind of 
10 service to the Nation to rejecting the rulings of the courts and to urging people to fight 
11 the rule of law, urging people to take action that was completely unjustified under our 
12 Constitution. 
13 Mr. Warrington. I'm going to note an objection for the record to this line of 
14 questioning as argumentative, but General Flynn can respond. 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 The Witness. I take the Fifth. 
Ms. Cheney. Thank you. 
- Thank you, Ms. Cheney. 
Does anybody else have any questions for the General at this point? 
Okay.

6 go on, "that has to be followed. But I will tell you, I'm a little concerned about Chief 51
