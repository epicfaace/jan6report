Yes. After this message, I was asked to have FBI meet with Brad Johnson, and I responded tha so could call or 
walk into FBl's Washington Field Office with any evidence he purports to have. On a follow up call, I learned that 
Johnson is working with Rudy Giuliani, who regarded my comments as "an insult". Ask a it I would reconsider, I 
flatly refused, said I would not be giving any special treatment to Giuliani or any of his "witness:es", and re-affirmed 
yet again that I will not talk to Giuliani about any of this.
