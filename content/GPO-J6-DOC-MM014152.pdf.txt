Three questions. Is there a way to speed up Fulton county signature verification in 
order to have results before Jan 6 if the trump campaign assist financially. Are the 
current runoff votes going through a signature verification that is as robust as the 
Cobb county efforts. How were the reported 8000 out of state absentee ballots 
discovered. Thanks
