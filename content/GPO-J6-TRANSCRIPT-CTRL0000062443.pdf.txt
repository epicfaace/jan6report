2 We are going on the record at 10:08 a.m. Good morning. This 
3 is the deposition of Robert Patrick Lewis conducted by the House Select Committee to 
4 Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol, pursuant to House 
5 Resolution 503. 
6 Mr. Lewis, can you please state your full name and spell your last name for the 
7 record? 
8 The Witness. Robert Patrick Lewis. Lewis is L-e-w-i-s. 
9 Thank you, Mr. Lewis. 
10 At this time, Mr. Lewis, can you please raise your right hand to be sworn by the 
11 official reporter? 
12 The Reporter. Do you solemnly declare and affirm under the penalty of perjury 
13 that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing 
14 but the truth? 
15 The Witness. I do. 
16 Thank you, Mr. Lewis. 
17 This will be a staff-led deposition, and members, of course, may also choose to ask 
18 questions. 
19 My name is I'm an investigative counsel with the select 
20 committee. In the room with me today are-investigative counsel;-
21 -professional staff member;- parliamentarian; senior 
22 administrative assistant; and chief clerk. And I think that's everyone. 
23 There are currently no members of the select committee in attendance. And I 
24 will announce any additional participants if they join. 
25 I would like to note for the record that what has previously been marked as  4 
1 exhibit 1 is the subpoena from Mr. Robert Patrick Lewis, which is dated April 1st, 2022. 
2 The House deposition rules are included the exhibit and were provided to you upon 
3 service of the subpoena. 
4 Under the House deposition rules, you are permitted to have an attorney present. 
5 And, at this time, can counsel for the witness please state her fill name? 
6 Ms. Gordon. My name is Leslie McAdoo Gordon. I am an attorney at law 
7 licensed to practice in the District of Columbia, the State of Maryland, and the 
8 Commonwealth of Virginia. 
9 Thank you, Ms. Gordon. 
10 Mr. Lewis, I also want to remind you, as we do with all witnesses, that it is 
11 unlawful to deliberately provide false information to Congress. Providing false 
12 information to Congress could result in criminal penalties, including for perjury and or 
13 providing false statements. 
14 Under House deposition rules, you may only refuse to answer a question to 
15 preserve a privilege recognized by the select committee. If you refuse to answer a 
16 question based on a privilege, staff may either proceed with the deposition on other 
17 questions or seek a ruling from the chairman on the objection. If the chairman 
18 overrules your objection, you will be required to answer the question. 
19 I'll note for the record that we received a letter from your attorney today around 2 
20 a.m. regarding your objections based on the First and Fifth Amendments. That letter 
21 has been marked as exhibit 23 and will be entered into the record. 
22 Ms. Gordon, given that we only received the letter a few hours ago, we're not in a 
23 position to fully respond before today's deposition. But we will work on our response 
24 and send it to you. 
25 Mr. Lewis, my goal today during the deposition is to ask questions relevant to the  5 
1 select committee's investigation with the hope that you'll answer. If you have an 
2 objection or a privilege assertion, we'll ask that you or your counsel assert it for the 
3 record. 
4 I will seek to clarify the basis for each objection. I understand from the letter 
5 that you may invoke the First or Fifth Amendment or both in response to our questions. 
6 Be that as it may, I will say that our goal is to understand the basis for your objection and 
7 fairly evaluate it. And ultimately the more detail you can provide about the basis for the 
8 objection, the easier it will be for the select committee to consider the objection. 
9 In addition, under the House deposition rules, select committee members and 
10 select committee staff may not discuss the substance of testimony you provide today, 
11 unless the committee approves release. You and your attorney will have an opportunity 
12 to review the transcript. No other recordings of this proceeding are permitted. 
13 And, Mr. Lewis, can you please confirm that you're not making an audio or video 
14 recording of the deposition? 
15 
16 
17 The Witness. I can confirm that. 
Thank you, Mr. Lewis. 
I just want to go through a couple of logistical points. So there is an official 
18 congressional reporter, who is transcribing the record of the deposition. The reporter is 
19 also joining us by Webex, as you saw. Please wait until each question is completed 
20 before you give your response. And we'll try to wait until your response is completed 
21 before we ask our next question. The reporter can't record nonverbal responses, such 
22 as shaking your head. So it's important that you answer each question with an audible 
23 verbal response. 
24 For the benefit of the reporter and the record, there may be times where I spell a 
25 name or a word that we're using or I ask you to do the same. We ask that you provide  6 
1 complete answers based on your best recollection. If the question's not clear, please 
2 ask for clarification. And if you don't know the answer, please just simply say so. We'll 
3 just --also logistically, please let us know if you need any breaks. And, as I was 
4 discussing with Ms. Gordon before we went on the record, throughout the deposition, 
5 we'll be directing your attention to exhibits, which will be displayed on the screen in front 
6 of you. When we refer to you a document, you are free to take time to familiarize 
7 yourself before we discuss the document. 
8 And on that note, can we please pull up exhibit 1? 
9 EXAMINATION 
10 BY 
11 Q Mr. Lewis, do you recognize this as the subpoena the select committee 
12 issued to you? 
13 A I decline to answer on the grounds the committee's deposition process 
14 violates the Rules of the United States House of Representatives and based on my rights 
15 under the First and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution. 
16 Ms. Gordon, it's just a simple factual question. 
17 Ms. Gordon. I know it is. But, as I advised the committee in my letter and as I 
18 have told you repeatedly over the last few weeks via telephone, this organization and the 
19 members and the officers for this organization are a civil liberties group, and they are 
20 protected by the First Amendment from compelled participation in precisely this kind of 
21 investigation or any investigation by the executive branch as well. And so, because it is 
22 a compulsory situation, you have issued a subpoena, the record is what it is. This 
23 document speaks for itself. We are declining under the Constitution and the rules of the 
24 House to answer any question that would be posed in this deposition today. Each and 
25 every question is going to receive the answer that Mr. Lewis just provided.  7 
1 All right. Well, I will note for the record that exhibit 1 is the 
2 subpoena that the select committee issued to Mr. Lewis. And it is dated April 1st, 2022. 
3 BY 
4 Q Mr. Lewis, I'll be leading the deposition today, but one of the other attorneys 
5 on the call may also chime in with questions. Do you have any questions? 
6 
7 
8 
9 A 
Q 
A 
Q I don't. 
I'm sorry, you broke up just then. 
No. 
Okay. Thank you. 
10 Mr. Lewis, I understand from your attorney --and we can take this exhibit 
11 down --Mr. Lewis, I understand from your attorney that there are two separate 
12 organizations that are known as First Amendment Praetorian, with one being a nonprofit 
13 organization and the other a for-profit organization. 
14 I also understand from my conversations with your attorney that it was the 
15 nonprofit organization known as 1AP, Inc., that is the relevant entity with regard to 
16 January 6th. The subpoena dated April 1, 2022, reflects that. 
17 Ms. Gordon, I understand that you will be sending a briefing paper to us today or 
18 tomorrow regarding the differences and functions of this organization. Is that correct? 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 Ms. Gordon. That's correct. 
Q 
A Thank you. 
BY 
Mr. Lewis, what is your role in 1AP, Inc.? 
I decline to answer on the grounds the committee's deposition process 
24 violates the Rules of the United States House of Representatives and based on my rights 
25 under the First and Fifth Amendments of the United States Constitution.  1 Q Thank you. And, just to be clear, but I understand the basis of the 
2 objection with regards to the Fifth Amendment. You're invoking the Fifth Amendment 
3 in response to that question on the grounds that your answers could potentially 
4 incriminate you? 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 Ms. Gordon. Invoking --
The Witness. Is that to me or Leslie? 
I'm sorry, Leslie, your audio is not working. 
Let's just take a minute recess while we resolve this. 
[Discussion off the record.] 
All right. So we will go back on the record at 10:17. 
11 Ms. Gordon, I had asked for the basis for Mr. Lewis' invocation of the Fifth 
12 Amendment, and I think you were about to respond. 
13 Ms. Gordon. And the basis of it is set forth in my letter of yesterday's date. 
14 The committee has postulated that there is a criminal conspiracy that they think arises 
15 under 18 U.S.C. 371. And, based on the committee's view that there is potential 
16 criminal exposure, Mr. Lewis is invoking his Fifth Amendment privilege. 8 
17 The Fifth Amendment, as the Congress should well know, protects the innocent as 
18 well as the guilty, and it is primarily directed at the protection of people who are 
19 innocently caught up in government investigations. So I object to the characterization 
20 of it as an invocation because it would tend to incriminate, but rather it is an invocation 
21 because the government is postulating criminal exposure. 
22 Thank you, Ms. Gordon, for that clarification. 
23 BY 
24 Q Mr. Lewis, I'd like to start by getting a little background on the history of the 
25 1AP.  9 
1 can we pull up exhibit 3? 
2 Mr. Lewis, this is a Twitter thread that you posted in September 2020 explaining 
3 the founding of 1AP. 
4 can we go down to number 17? 
5 And, you know, this is a very detailed explanation. I'm just curious; there were a 
6 couple of points in which you mention threats from antifa, BLM, others, and, with regard 
7 to number 17, specifically protecting attendees of President Trump's campaign rallies. 
8 And I was hoping you could help me understand what threats you were seeing at those 
9 rallies and how 1AP intended and planned to counter those threats? 
10 A I decline to answer on the grounds that the committee's deposition process 
11 violates the Rules of the United States House of Representatives and based on my rights 
12 under the First and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution. 
13 
14 Q Okay. Thank you, Mr. Lewis. 
Mr. Lewis, I have a set of questions about the founding of 1AP. Is it your 
15 intention to assert the objections based on the First and Fifth Amendment in response to 
16 all questions the committee would have on that subject? 
17 
18 A 
Q Yes. 
Thank you. We can take that down. 
19 Mr. Lewis and Ms. Gordon, for the purposes of moving along efficiently, I'm happy 
20 to offer the option of simply stating "First and Fifth," that in quotation marks, if your 
21 intention is to raise objections based on those privileges. 
22 Ms. Gordon. There is actually a technical objection based on the rules. So I 
23 would suggest that his invocation could say "Rules, First, and Fifth"; that would cover it. 
24 Okay. And we'll take that to understand --we'll take that to be 
25 shorthand for the full phrase and the associated explanation you gave today and in your  1 letter. 
2

Ms. Gordon. Agreed.

Q Do you have a relationship with Donald Trump? 
A "Rules, First, and Fifth." 
Q I'm going to pause here and see if any of my colleagues have any questions 
19 before I --before we wrap up. 
20 Mr. Lewis, have you been interviewed by law enforcement regarding your 
21 knowledge of events in Washington, D.C., on January 6th? 
22 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A 
Q "Rules, First, and Fifth." 
Have you been contacted by the FBI regarding January 6th? 
"Rules, First, and Fifth." 
Have you been contacted by any attorneys representing individuals charged  18 
1 with criminal conduct on that day? 
"Rules, First, and Fifth." 2 
3 A 
Q Is it your intention to assert the First and Fifth Amendment in response to all 
4 questions we ask you regarding contact made by law enforcement investigating the 
5 events of January 6th? 
6 A Yes, it is. 
7 Q Mr. Lewis --and this may be a question better directed at Ms. Gordon. The 
8 letter dated April 13th, 2022, and that we've marked as exhibit 2 indicates that Mr. Lewis 
9 refuses to produce any documents in response to the committee's subpoena in part 
10 based on Fifth Amendment objections. And I just wanted to clarify the basis for those 
11 objections because the letter did not explain it; at least that specific letter did not explain 
12 it. Is Mr. Lewis invoking his right because the act of production would violate his Fifth 
13 Amendment rights, or is it that the content of the documents raises Fifth Amendment 
14 concerns? 
15 Ms. Gordon. So we're raising it as to production --objection to the production of 
16 the documents. So it is --you're correct; it is not specifically set forth in the letter April 
17 13th. But, in my letter of April 14th, I say that the rationale and the letter of the 14th 
18 covers both document production and deposition questions. 
19 Thank you for clarifying. 
20 BY 
21 
22 Q All right. 
Mr. Lewis, just a couple more questions. Are you familiar with the QAnon 
23 conspiracy theory? 
24

Do you believe the 2020 election was stolen? 
"Rules, First, and Fifth." 
Do you believe Joe Biden is the legitimate President of the United States? 
"Rules, First, and Fifth." 
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Lewis. 
11 At this point, Mr. Lewis has asserted First and Fifth Amendment privileges as a 
12 basis to refuse to answer all of the select committee's questions today. 19 
13 Under these circumstances, we will not close the record on the deposition as the 
14 select committee determines the appropriate course of action to move forward. 
15 And, before we go off the record, I will pause to see if any of my colleagues wish 
16 to offer anything else. 
17 Okay. 
18 At this time, the deposition will stand in recess, subject to the call of the chair.

25 Ms. Gordon. [Inaudible.] 
Leslie, your audio is not working again. 
Ms. Gordon. Can you hear me now? 
Very faintly. 
Ms. Gordon. Can you hear me now? 
Yes. 
Ms. Gordon. Yes. Before we wrap, I want to reiterate again that the privileges  20 
1 that we're --
2 I'm sorry. Ms. Gordon, I just want to confirm with the reporters 
3 that we are still on the record. 
4 
5 The Reporter. Yes. We are on the record. 
Ms. Gordon. But, before we wrap up, I want to assert again that the reason that 
6 Mr. Lewis and his organization is asserting constitutional privileges is because of the 
7 decisions and choices that the committee has made to pursue this interview in a 
8 nonvoluntary fashion and its own assertion that there is criminal exposure for the reasons 
9 set forth in its legal pleadings. 
10 Many of the questions that you have asked today we would have been willing to 
11 answer voluntarily but not in the context of a compelled interview. 
12 And if the situation of the Fifth Amendment could be resolved, again, all of 
13 that --the committee holds the keys to resolving all of those problems and obtaining 
14 information that it's seeking apparently from Mr. Lewis and from First Amendment 
15 Praetorian. 
16 Well, Ms. Gordon, thank you for those remarks. And I just want 
17 to state for the record that we were, I think, having productive conversations towards a 
18 voluntary interview. You have stated your client's position. The committee has made 
19 filings in different cases. And I just want to be clear that, you know, I repeatedly tried to 
20 scope a potential interview with you and try to understand the actual topics that Mr. 
21 Lewis would actually answer. And I regret that it's gotten to this point where a 
22 compulsory process was necessary, but this is the path that the committee has 
23 determined is the best course of action. 
24 Ms. Gordon. Well, to be clear on that, the compulsory process was initiated 
25 from the beginning. The discussions we had about doing a voluntary participation  21 
1 occurred after the committee had already issued subpoenas. 
2 But I agree with you, we were making very good progress toward having a 
3 voluntary situation until the committee served us with the possibility of a criminal 
4 conspiracy and the possibility of criminal prosecution, which obviously puts an entirely 
5 different light on the entire situation. But, again, the committee has the ability to 
6 resolve both of the constitutional problems that we're raising. If it wants to do so, all it 
7 needs to do is contact me to see about resolving it. 
8 Understood. And we understand that you've taken the position 
9 that Mr. Lewis could potentially be implicated in a criminal conspiracy. 
10 Ms. Gordon. That's not my position; it's the committee's position based on its 
11 filing. That is very clearly stated in my letter.

20 Okay. All right. 
Thank you both. 
And we'll go off the record at 10:39. 
Mr. Lewis, Ms. Gordon, thank you for being here. 
Ms. Gordon. Thank you. 
Ms. Gordon, I'll see you on Monday. 
Ms. Gordon. Okay. Bye. 
Take care. 
Ms. Gordon. Have a nice holiday. 
21 You too.
