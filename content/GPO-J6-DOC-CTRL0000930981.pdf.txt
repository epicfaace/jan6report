SUBJECT: Final January 6th After Action Quick Look Report John A. Donnelly, Sr. 
Fire and EMS Chief 
SOD 
This is a rapid review of the Fire & EMS Department's preparation and response to the events at 
the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. A detailed timeline of the incident is attached. 
Executive Summary 
Planning for this day spanned several days with multiple partner agencies and jurisdictions. The 
March for Trump rally was organized by the conservative group, Women for America First. The 
group was projecting an estimated 5,000 Trump supporters to attend the rally on the grounds of 
the Ellipse. Beyond the Ellipse, there was no exact footprint for this event. It was expected that 
demonstrations would occur throughout the day and into the evening at multiple locations to 
include the Ellipse, Freedom Plaza, the Capitol, the Supreme Court, and other areas. 
Deployment 
An Area Command was established for the day's activities at the Fire Operations Center with 
multiple resources deployed to the National Mall. In addition to the pre-staged resources around 
the Ellipse, additional units were staffed in Operations to support First Amendment Activities.

(202) 462-0807  At 0500 hours the following additional Supervisor and EMS units were staffed at the White 
House and at the Ellipse event: 
• Medic 50 (White House) 
• Medic 51 and Ambulance 52 (Ellipse) 
• Ellipse Medical Tent Liaison -EMS Supervisor 9 (0600 hours) 
• Medic 52 and Medic 53 
At 0700 hours the following additional positions and units were staffed to support First 
Amendment Activities: 
• Liaison assigned to MPD Joint Operations Command Center 
• Liaison assigned to White House EOC 
• Additional Fire Liaison Officer (FLO) at Office of Unified Communications (1000 hours) 
• Two additional EMS Liaison Officers (ELO) at Office of Unified Communications 
• Additional Battalion Fire Chief (BFC-9) 
• Additional "Recon" Battalion Fire Chief 
• Additional EMS Supervisor 9 
• Four additional Engine Companies 
• Six additional Ambulances 
• Additional Hazardous Materials Unit (HMU-2) 
• Two Rapid Detection Teams 
• Staffed Brush Unit 
• Mobile Command Unit staffed with driver 
• Medical Ambulance Buses staffed with drivers 
At 0700 hours the Area Command was established, and a White House Division and an Ellipse 
Division were created under the Area Command. 
The Ellipse event permit was the largest in terms of crowd size, expecting to host an estimated 
5,000 people. This event did receive Special Event attention and a medical first aid tent was 
staffed with George Washington Hospital personnel. The event footprint spanned from 15th 
Street, NW to 17th Street, NW. The crowd increased exponentially, and at 0856 hours, the 
Ellipse Liaison reported an estimated 4,000 people inside the perimeter. At that point, Fire and 
EMS identified limited access to one entry point and organizers at this event were ordered to 
provide an additional exit point on 17th Street, NW. At approximately 0905 hours the Ellipse 
Liaison reported a crowd of 10,000 people gathering on 15th and Constitution Avenue NW. 
At 0931 hours Area Command established the Constitution A venue Command and Battalion 9 
was assigned to manage the Ellipse event and the incident growing around the Ellipse. Engine 
13 and Engine 83 were dispatched to the location and then held on the event by command to 
assist. By 1330 hours, the Ellipse Liaison reported that the crowd dissipated to less than 100 
people. 
Page 2 of 15  US Capitol Response 
At 1300 hours, multiple 911 calls for EMS started to come in for the U.S. Capitol. At 1307 
hours, a report from Metropolitan Police indicated that the area around the U.S. Capitol was not 
secure, followed by two reports of CPR in progress, multiple police officers injured, and the 
crowd overtaking barriers. These twenty minutes worth of events culminated with a report of 
unexploded explosive devices at the Republican and Democratic National Committee 
Headquarters. 
It was evident that this was an expanding incident with the potential for mass casualties, fires, 
active shooter, and hazardous materials incidents that would exceed the resources at hand. Area 
Command then expanded the Incident Management System by establishing a Capitol Command. 
Capitol Command then successfully managed multiple requests for EMS assistance throughout 
the event. 
Fire and EMS continued to manage multiple incidents under Area Command for the remainder 
of the day, including a working fire in the 4th Battalion. Most of the operations started to wind 
down around 2100 hours. However, Area Command was sustained through 1900 hours on 
January 7, 2021. 
Total recorded responses for the day were: 
• 22 EMS responses 
• 14 EMS transports, including two cardiac arrests and two critical injury transports. 
The above data does not include treatment and release of an estimated 250 injured law 
enforcement and National Guard personnel and an estimated 50 rioters. 
Command and Tactical Observations 
The following is a list of command and tactical observations: 
✓ Communications with US Capitol Police could have been improved with earlier 
placement of Liaisons in USCP CP and with Field Commanders. 
✓ Cellular Service interruptions resulted in lost connection/signal to our MDC I/Mobile 
tablets (which use non-First Net modems); unit First Net Cellular phones worked, 
members personal devices did not. 
✓ Radio connectivity challenges occurred inside of the Capitol Building. It is not known if 
any attempts were made to utilize the Vehicle Repeater System (VRS) 
✓ Situation Unit reporting needs a method to flag critical events for the Incident 
Commander. 
✓ There was a delay in rapidly staffing and mobilizing the Mass Decontamination Unit. 
✓ The potential need for additional trauma supplies must be an early consideration. 
✓ There were challenges locating patients in the crowd and in the complex. Call takers 
must be prepared to give direction to callers for self-evacuation to specific "collection 
points" outside of the hazard zone when possible and appropriate. 
Page 3 of 15  ✓ Coordination must be improved between Area Command/Incident Commanders and 911 
dispatchers concerning the dispatch/deployment of resources within operational area of 
an event. 
✓ Command must declare hot, warm, and cold zones as early as possible and be aware that 
these zones are likely to be "dynamic" due to constantly changing conditions. 
✓ Early establishment of casualty collection points/zones must be a high priority. 
✓ Provision for human services needs for crews on this long-duration incidents was not 
adequate (lack of water, food, and bathrooms) and must be considered earlier in the 
incident. 
✓ It was difficult to maintain safety and accountability of members due to rapidly 
deteriorating, and intermingled battle lines. 
✓ Members indicated a concern that COVID PPE reduced their visibility while working in 
the crowd. 
✓ Early peer support was beneficial to members that were involved in this event. 
✓ Methods of identification on ballistic equipment worn by our members should be re­
evaluated in effort to provide greater distinction between law enforcement members and 
Fire and EMS personnel. 
✓ The presence of at least two privately owned retired emergency vehicles used by 
demonstrators was a concern (Haz-Mat vehicle and an Ambulance with MAGA 
Markings). Although not used as a direct means for nefarious activity during this event, 
command staff must consider the potential threat these types of vehicles could present.
