2 It is August 10th, and this is a deposition 
3 of Mr. Michael Roman conducted by the House Select Committee to 
4 Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol 
5 pursuant to House Resolution 503. 
6 At this time, I'd ask you, Mr. Roman, to state your full 
7 name and spell your last name for the record. 
8 Mr. Roman. Michael A. Roman. Romeo, Oscar, Mike, 
9 Echo (sic), November. 
10 Thank you, Mr. Roman. 
11 And I see that we have a few people from Mr. Warrington's 
12 law firm joining as counsel today. 
13 Mr. Warrington, if you could introduce yourself and then, 
14 I th i n k , for e ff i c i ency , i f you could j us t i n trod u c e the others 
15 a n d i den t i f y t he i r po s i t i on s . 
16 Mr. Warrington. Sure. Absolutely. 
17 David A. Warrington, W-a-r-r-i-n-g-t-o-n, for Mr. Roman. 
18 Along w i th me f r om o u r f i rm a re Mi k e Col um b o , C -o -l -u -m -b -o ; 
19 Jon at ha n Sh aw , S -h -a -w ; and Glyn i s G i l i o , G -i -l -i -o . 
20 Very good. Thank you. And they're all 
21 attorneys on the team representing Mr. Roman, correct? 
22 Mr. Warrington. That's correct. 
23 Very good. 
24 All right. At this time, I'd ask the reporters who are 
25 joining remotely to swear in Mr. Roman.  4 
1 The Reporter. Do you solemnly declare and affirm that the 
2 testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole 
3 truth, and nothing but the truth? 
4 Mr. Roman. I do. 
5 Thank you very much. 
6 So this is going to be a staff-led deposition, but if any 
7 members of the select committee join, they of course may choose 
8 to also ask questions. 
9 You can see there on the platform, if you have the 
10 participants list up, everybody who's in the meeting remotely. 
11 And if any members join, I'll try to announce their presence so 
12 that you, Mr. Warrington, and the others know that they' re here, 
13 and I'll try to do so as quickly as possible, though there may 
14 be a delay. 
15 Just introducing the people that are in the room with me, 
16 my name is I'm a senior investigative counsel for 
17 the select committee. To my left is , investigative 
18 counsel for the committee, and to my right is professional staff 
19 member , who's also with the select committee. On 
20 the platform, other staff is joining as well, including our chief 
21 clerk, , and potentially others as well. 
22 You also see a number of official reporters. They are 
23 taking the official record of today's deposition. There are 
24 more than one, and there are likely going to be more than one, 
25 but there's only one of them who's taking the official record  5 
1 at a ti me. 
2 Just to go over some of the ground rules that we're going 
3 to be following, under the House deposition rules, neither the 
4 committee members nor staff may discuss the substance of 
5 testimony you provide today unless the committee approves it 
6 release. And you and Mr. Warrington, your attorneys, will have 
7 an opportunity to review the transcript after we're done here 
8 today. 
9 We're going to follow the House deposition rules that we 
10 provided to Mr. Warrington previously. Under those rules, 
11 counsel for other persons or government agencies may not attend. 
12 And, of course, you are allowed to have an attorney present, and 
13 we've noted their presence already on the record today. 
14 It is against the rules to make any outside recordings of 
15 this, and I'd just ask for you to confirm that neither you nor 
16 anyone you're aware of is recording this session on your end. 
17 Is that correct? 
18 M r . Wa r r i n gt on . We ' re not rec o rd i n g . 
19 Okay. Thank you, Mr. Warrington. 
20 Like I mentioned before, there's an official reporter 
21 transcribing the record of this deposition. Because it's done 
22 using stenography, please wait until my question is complete 
23 be f o re you beg i n you r response , and I w i l l let you complete you r 
24 response before asking my next question. 
25 Of course, the reporter can't take nonverbal responses,  6 
1 like shaking your head, so it is important that you answer each 
2 question with an audible and verbal response. 
3 We do ask that you provide complete answers based on your 
4 best recollection. We understand that some of these events 
5 happened over a year ago, and so if you don't remember something, 
6 that's perfectly fine; you can just say so. But you are under 
7 oath, and if do you remember something, you are obligated to 
8 provide that information. 
9 Also, if a question that I ask is not clear, please go ahead 
10 and ask for clarification. Or if anybody else asks a question 
11 that's unclear, same thing. We'd rather have you answer a 
12 question that you understand than try to answer one that you 
13 don't. 
14 You may only refuse to answer a question to preserve a 
15 privilege recognized by the select committee. And if you refuse 
16 to answer a question based on a privilege, we can either proceed 
17 with the deposition or seek a ruling from the chairman on the 
18 objection. If the chairman overrules such an objection, you 
19 would be required to answer the question. 
20 And, finally, I do want to let you know that it's unlawful 
21 to deliberately provide false information to Congress. And 
22 since this deposition is under oath, providing false information 
23 could res u l t i n c r i mi n al penal t i es f o r p e r j u r y and/ o r p r o vi d i n g 
24 false statements. 
25 Logistically, the last thing I'll mention here is that  7 
1 please just let us know if at any time you need a break, either 
2 for comfort or to speak with Mr. Warrington or any of your 
3 attorneys. We're happy to allow for that, to comply with that. 
4 And if you do so, I would just recommend that you turn off your 
5 microphone and turn off your video so that nobody is going to 
6 hear your end of the conversation that you're having. 
7 Are there any questions about anything that we just went 
8 over? 
9 
10 
11 
12 Mr. Roman. No. 
Okay. Did you understand everything? 
Mr. Roman. Yes. 
Very good. 
13 At this point, Mr. Warrington, I don't know if you have 
14 anything that you would like to put on the record before we begin 
15 quest i on s , but i f you ' d l i k e to , now ' s the opp o rt u n i t y . 
16 Mr . Warr i n gt on . No , I don ' t . 
17 Okay. Very good. 
18 EXAMINATION 
19 BY 
20 Q Then, at this time, I'm going to pull up exhibit No. 1. 
21 Make sure you can see that. And this is a subpoena titled at 
22 the top ex hi bi t No . 1 . 
23 
24 
25 If we could blow that up a little bit. 
Bear with us one moment. 
There we go. Are you able to see the exhibit we've just  8 
1 put up, Mr. Roman? 
2 A Yes. 
3 Q Very good. Thank you. And do you understand you're 
4 appearing pursuant to the subpoena dated March 28, 2021, with 
5 your name, Michael A. Roman, at the top of it? 
6 A There's a different date on the subpoena you have on the 
7 screen. 
8 Q I'm sorry. If we go down, we'll show you the date that 
9 the subpoena was actually issued. At the bottom of page 1 there, 
10 it's March 28th. 
11 
12 A 
Q Okay. 
Do you understand you're appearing here today pursuant 
13 to this subpoena? 
14 A Yeah, I believe so. There were two subpoenas. 
15 Q Okay. This one, though, is the second one that you 
16 actually were served with, correct? 
17 A Yes. 
18 Q Very 
19 
20 A 
Q I believe so. 
--good. 
21 And the subpoena that you received did require the 
22 production of documents described in the schedule attached to 
23 the subpoena. Are you aware of that? 
24 
25 A Yes. 
Q We received from you through Mr. Warrington  9 
1 approximately 74 files, give or take. But after that 
2 production, we understand that other responsive documents would 
3 not be produced based on an assertion of the Fifth Amendment 
4 privilege. 
5 Is that your understanding of the document production? 
6 
7 A 
Q My attorney has my documents. 
Okay. And is that your understanding of the 
8 production, that some were produced and others may or may not 
9 have been if they were responsive documents? 
10 
11 A 
Q Yes. 
Have you destroyed, deleted, or otherwise manipulated 
12 any documents that are responsive to the request described in 
13 the subpoena, regardless of whether they were produced or not? 
14 A No. 
15 Q Other than your lawyers, have you coordinated with 
16 anyone about your production of documents to the select 
17 committee? 
18 And just to be clear, I don't want to get into any 
19 discussions that you've had with your lawyers that would be 
20 privileged. 
21 
22 
23 
24 Mr. Roman. Can we mute it for a second? 
Sure. 
[Witness conferring with counsel.] 
Mr. Warrington. And just to be clear,_ we had a 
25 third-party vendor involved in the collection of documents.  10 
1 That's the only other person --or, only other people that 
2 were --and they were working for us, the law firm. 
- Okay. 
BY 3 
4 
5 Q So then, I guess I'll just clarify by saying 
6 that. Other than your lawyers and anybody hi red by your lawyers 
7 to help with the production of documents, have you coordinated 
8 with anybody about which documents to produce or not to produce 
9 to the select committee? 
10 
11 A 
Q No. 
And other than your lawyers or anybody hired by your 
12 lawyers for your appearance before the select committee, have 
13 you coordinated with anybody about the testimony that you may 
14 provide here today? 
15 A No. 
16 Q So my goal today is to ask questions that are relevant 
17 to our investigation, with the hope that you' re going to answer. 
18 If you do have an objection or privilege assertion, we'll ask 
19 that you assert it for the record. 
20 And I note that there has been some correspondence on this 
21 issue with Mr. Warrington as well as the chairman of the select 
22 commit tee. 
23 So I do want to start, though, with your professional 
24 background. I understand that back in the '90s you began, I 
25 guess, a career in politics. You worked with State Senator --or  11 
1 the campaign for State Senator Bruce Marks in Pennsylvania, is 
2 that right, around 1993? 
3 A Yes. 
4 Q And you yourself were elected a ward leader in 
5 Philadelphia in 2002 or thereabouts? 
6 A Yes. 
7 Q Did you serve as that for about 4 years, until 2006? 
8 
9 A 
Q Yes. 
And I understand you also worked with the Pennsylvania 
10 House Republican Campaign Committee. Is that correct? 
11 
12 A 
Q 
13 recall? 
14 
15 A 
Q Yes. 
Approximately how long did you do that, if you can 
I don't recall. 
Ultimately you worked through various other jobs, 
16 ending up in Mr. Trump --Trump's White House starting in 2017. 
17 Was that the beginning of the Trump administration? 
18 A Yes. 
19 Q What was your role in the White House? 
20 A Special Assistant to the President. 
21 Q Did you have a particular portfolio that you worked? 
22 [Witness conferring with counsel.] 
23 Mr. Roman. Yes. I was working in White House Counsel's 
24 Office, assisting with vetting and clearance counsel. 
25 BY  12 
1 Q I've seen that you may have also had as part of your title 
2 or a description of your job "Director of Special Projects and 
3 Research." Is that right? 
4 
5 A Yes. 
Q Was that the same job duties that you just described 
6 working on inside White House Counsel's Office? 
7 A Yes. 
8 Q And you said "clearance counsel." Is that nominations? 
9 Or could you be a little bit more specific about what that 
10 involved? 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 PPO. 
19 A Yes. Nominations. 
Q Did you have any other roles outside of the nominations? 
A Vetting of potential employees. 
Q Okay. Employees --
A Non-Senate-confirmed employees. 
Q Did you do that with the Personnel Office? 
A No. That was through White House Counsel's Office and 
Q And when you say "employees," are you talking about 
20 White House employees or administration employees more broadly? 
21 A Administration employees. 
22 Q So i t could be at o the r age n c i es i n the exec u t i v e b ranch . 
23 I understand you left the White House around 2018. Is that 
24 
25 right? 
A Yes.  1

A

A 
Q 
When did 
A 
reelect. 
Q 
A 
Q 
Spring? 
A Where did you go after leaving the White House? 
Philadelphia. 
Okay. And where were you working? 
I was consulting. 13 
With whom? As an employer, as opposed to your clients. 
I --
Who was your employer? 
I was self-employed. 
Eventually you made it to the Trump reelection campaign. 
you start working with the Trump reelection campaign? 
I don't recall the exact month that I went with the Trump 
Do you remember what year it was? 
2019. 
Could you give us a season? Summer? Fall? Winter? 
If you recall. 
It was before the --it was before summer. So it 
18 would've been in the first half of the year. 
19 Q Were you asked to join the campaign by the President or 
20 anybody else? 
21 A I don't recall who --the President didn't ask me to join 
22 the campaign. 
23 Q When you joined the campaign around springtime of 2019, 
24 what were your responsibilities? 
25 A I was working on --I was doing some --I had a number  14 
1 of things I was doing. I'm --I can't recall all of my projects 
2 that I had. 
3 Q Okay. Can you give us a flavor, just some of them, the 
4 type of work that you were doing? 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 that? A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Normal campaign outreach. 
Like knocking on doors? 
No. I was not knocking on doors. 
Okay. So what does "outreach" mean to you when you say 
Coordinating with people in the States. 
State officials? 
No. Campaign. 
Okay. And you were working out of Pennsylvania? 
Yes. 
But your job involved coordinating with people in other 
16 States outside of Pennsylvania? Is that fair? 
17 
18 A 
Q Yes. 
Did you have interactions with any State officials in 
19 Pennsylvania or otherwise during your work on the Trump 
20 reelection campaign? 
21 
22 A 
Q Yes. 
Okay. With whom? Which States did have you contact 
23 with State officials? 
24 A I don't recall the States. Um --I don't recall the 
25 States.  Pennsylvania? 
Pennsylvania, yes. 15 
1 
2 
3 Q 
A 
Q And did you have a primary contact, as far as State 
4 officials in Pennsylvania, that you would usually speak to about 
5 campaign-related issues? 
6 
7 
8 A 
Q 
A No. 
Can you name some of the State officials? 
There's --I need to --hold on. 
9 [Witness conferring with counsel.] 
10 Mr. Warrington. -can you clarify the question? Just, 
11 it's a little confusing, and I think if we narrow exactly what 
12 you' re looking for, I think he could probably give you an answer 
13 that's what you're looking for. 
14 Yep. That's perfectly fine. I'm happy to do 
15 that. 
16 BY 
17 Q Before we do that, though, actually, what was the title 
18 you had when you we re h i red by the Trump reelect i on camp a i g n back 
19 in 2019? 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Senior advisor. 
Anything else or just "senior advisor"? 
Just "senior advisor." 
Did it ever change, your title? 
Not officially. 
Did it change unofficially?  16 
1 A It was quoted in the newspaper as "di rector of election 
2 day operations." 
3 Q Did you have those responsibilities, directing election 
4 day operations, for the Trump campaign at any point? 
5 
6 
7 
8 A Yes. 
Q When did you begin those responsibilities? 
A When I began working on the campaign. 
Q Who did you report to when you started at the campaign 
9 in springtime 2019? 
10 
11 A 
Q Justin Clark. 
Did that ever change throughout your time working for 
12 the Trump reelection campaign? 
13 
14 A 
Q No. 
And we're going to get into some other folks, as well, 
15 as we go th rough th i s de po s i t i on , but d i d you eve r rep o rt to Rudy 
16 Giuliani when he began working with the campaign after the 
17 election? 
18 
19 
20 
21 A 
Q No. 
Did you ever interact with Mr. Giuliani? 
Mr. Warrington. One moment,_ 
Mr.~ Okay. 
22 [Witness conferring with counsel.] 
23 Mr. Warrington. You're talking about --what period of 
24 time are you talking about, -just so I can clarify? 
25 Mr. -- Well, I guess at any point during his time  17 
1 working on the campaign, so either before the election or after. 
2 Mr. Warrington. Well, let's break that up into two 
3 questions. 
4 Sure. 
5 BY~ 
6 
7 Q 
A Let's do before the election. 
I don't believe I had any interaction with him before 
8 the election. 
9 Q And what about after the election? Did you have any 
10 interactions with Mr. Giuliani after the November 2020 
11 Presidential election? 
12 A On the advice of counsel, I assert my constitutional 
13 privilege under the Fifth Amendment and respectfully decline to 
14 answer the question. 
15 Q Understood. 
16 Mr. Warrington. And, for shorthand, as we've done 
17 before, as the assertion is or, as the privilege is asserted, 
18 can we j us t use the sh o rt hand of " the F i ft h " ? 
19 That's perfectly fine, yeah. If you say "the 
20 Fifth," we'll understand what that means moving forward. 
21 Mr. Warrington. Okay. 
22 BY 
23 Q So, to get back to one of the questions we had before 
24 a brief sidebar you had with counsel, you mentioned interacting 
25 with various State officials during your time working for the  18 
1 Trump reelection campaign. 
2 Starting first with Pennsylvania, which State officials in 
3 Pennsylvania did you primarily interact with in your job working 
4 for Trump campaign? 
5 Mr. Warrington. can we break that up into time 
6 periods? 
7 Sure. 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 Q Before the election? 
A Yeah. I --can you -­
[Witness conferring with counsel.] 
Mr. Roman. So one of the things that I was doing was 
13 tracking legislation that would affect the election code. So 
14 if a particular bill was introduced, I would often call either 
15 t he s po n so r o r co s po n so r of t he b i l l to g e t a f l av o r of t he b i l l 
16 and what they thought the possibility was of it moving into 
17 committee/out of committee. 
18 There were a number of bills that were introduced in 
19 Pennsylvania and other States that would've had sponsors and 
20 cosponsors. I don't recall all of the officials that I would've 
21 called --that I called, but it would've been dictated by the 
22 person that either introduced or cosponsored a bill. 
23 BY 
24 Q Okay. Did you have any communications with State 
25 officials in Pennsylvania before the election outside of that,  19 
1 kind of, bill tracking? 
2 A I have a number of friends who hold titles in 
3 Pennsylvania that I'm sure I had conversations with. None that 
4 I was reaching out to that I recall for specific purposes outside 
5 of legislation. 
6 Q Okay. And we're not so interested, I guess, in the, 
7 kind of, friendly communications you would've had, but more so 
8 the communications you had that are relevant for your role 
9 working on the Trump reelection campaign. I appreciate you 
10 making that distinction as well. 
11 What about after the Presidential election? What were the 
12 nature of your communications with State officials in 
13 Pennsylvania like then? 
14 
15 A 
Q The Fifth. 
After the campaign --or, excuse me, after the 
16 Presidential election in November, who were the primary State 
17 officials that you were interacting with in Pennsylvania? 
18 A The F i ft h . 
19 Q And some of this we'll get back to as well. 
20 Other than tracking legislation, understanding changes or 
21 potential changes to election codes in various States, what other 
22 responsibilities did you have before the election working with 
23 the Trump campaign? 
24 A I was also monitoring changes to the code through 
25 administrative orders, through emergency COVID protocols. I  20 
1 was working on putting together plans for the way an election 
2 was conducted in a particular --any particular State. 
3 Q Okay. Anything else that can you recall? 
4 
5 A 
Q Not at this moment. 
You said you reported to Justin Clark. Were you taking 
6 direction from anybody else working with the Trump reelection 
7 campaign before the election? 
8 
9 
10 
11 A 
Q 
A 
Q Direction? 
Correct. 
Can you clarify "direction"? 
Yeah, sure. Was there anybody else within the Trump 
12 reelection campaign who were asking you to do tasks, take on 
13 certain events, certain projects, things like that? 
14 [Witness conferring with counsel.] 
15 Mr. 
16 BY 
17 Q Yep. Go ahead. You took a moment with Mr. Warrington, 
18 but you' re back now. 
19 A I was often asked to contact stakeholders --RNC 
20 members, State chairs --who were interested in election day 
21 operations to hear them out. 
22 Q Of those stakeholders, what were the types of things 
23 that you recall hearing before the election? What was the 
24 interest, the discussions about, with respect to election day 
25 operations?  21 
1 A Many of the questions were, are we doing anything in 
2 their State? Often the answer was no. And in the ones where 
3 we did have operations, I would normally give them information 
4 for who the State director was. 
5 Q Can you describe for us the types of activities that 
6 these stakeholders were interested in? When they asked you, are 
7 you, Mr. Roman, or the Trump campaign doing something in our 
8 State, what specifically would you have in mind when you answered 
9 that question "no"? Or, if there was something going on, what 
10 were those things? 
11 Mr. Warrington. And, to be clear, we're talking about 
12 pr i or to the elect i on . 
That's correct. Thank you, Mr. Warrington. 13 
14 Mr. Roman. Would we have an apparatus in place if a voter 
15 had a con c e r n about v o t i n g , i f they we re unable to cast a b al lot , 
16 if they had concerns about long lines at polling places due to 
17 previous history, if they had concerns about changes in the 
18 election code that may disrupt the normal election procedure. 
19 It was a lot of drilling down into the mechanics of the 
20 electoral process and what the campaign was doing to ensure that 
21 every voter that was coming out was able to cast a ballot and 
22 that illegal ballots, if there were any, would be identified. 
23 BY 
24 Q From your previous answer, it sounds like in some States 
25 the Trump campaign was active with respect to those types of  22 
1 efforts and some States there was no activity in. Is that 
2 correct? 
Yes. 3 
4 A 
Q How did the campaign or you choose which States to be 
5 active in with those types of efforts that you just described? 
6 A I did not choose the States that we were operating in. 
7 Q Do you know who did? 
8 A No. 
9 Q Which States were those operations going on in that you 
10 recall before the election? 
11 A Sure. Pennsylvania, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, 
12 Wisconsin, Ohio, Minnesota, Montana, Arizona, New Mexico, 
13 Nevada, New Hampshire, Maine. That's all I recall. 
14 Q All right. And do you know why those States were 
15 selected in particular for those types of activities that you 
16 des c r i bed earl i er? 
17 
18 A 
Q Those were target battleground States. 
Sounds like other, kind of, State chairs or party 
19 officials reached out to you in this pre-election period asking 
20 if there were activities like that going on in their States and 
21 you said no. Do you remember the States where there weren't 
22 those types of activities? 
23 A Every other State except for the ones that I mentioned 
24 we did have activity. 
25 Q I see . 0 k a y .  23 
1 I'm going to pause there just to see if anybody else has 
2 any questions along the lines of what we just went over. 
3 nothing from me. 
4 
5 
6 Q All right. I do want to, more generally, go into some 
7 of the accounts that you used as well as the means of 
8 communications that you had. 
9 I understand that your Twitter handle, at least from the 
10 period of November 2020 through January of 2021, which is 
11 primarily our focus here, was @mikeroman. Is that correct? 
12 A Yes. 
13 Actually, could I ask one clarifying question? 
14 Sure. 
15 Mr. Roman, at the outset of the deposition, 
16 you spelled your name for the record, and I thought I heard you 
17 spell it R-o-m-, Echo, November, rather than Alf a, November. 
18 Which of those is accurate? 
19 
20 Mr. Roman. If I did that, that was a flub on my part. 
Great. So R-o-m-a-n is the correct spelling 
21 of your last name? 
22 Mr. Roman. Yes, ma'am. 
23 
24 
25 Q Okay. Thank you. 
BY 
Other than that @mikeroman Twitter handle, did you use  24 
1 any other Twitter handles to communicate or post information on 
2 Twitter? 
3 A No. 
4 Q And did you use a phone number in that same period, so, 
5 again, November 2020 through January 2021, with area code. 
6 that ended in 7 I'd rather not put the entire number on the 
7 record, if you recognize that number. So did you use a number 
8 like that? 
9 
10 A 
Q Yes. 
And did you use that number to send or receive text 
11 messages related to the election? 
12 
13 A 
Q Yes. 
Was your email for the Trump reelection campaign 
14 mroman@donaldtrump.com? 
15 
16 
17 I believe that's correct, yes. A 
Q And we also understand that you had an email account that 
was a variation of your name ending in Again, 
18 I ' m not go i n g to put the en t i re em a i l add res s on the rec o rd . But 
19 
20 
21 do you remember using an email address with the domain 
7 
A That's my personal email address. And I did receive 
22 emails, and I attempted to push those people to my DJT email. 
23 Q So, if it was related to campaign issues, you would try 
24 to push anybody who contacted you at that email address to your 
25 official email account?  25 
1 A Yes. 
2 Q And you produced to the select committee several 
3 messages that appear to be from a Signal account. Is that right? 
4 Did you have a Signal account that you used in that time? 
5 A Yes. 
6 Q And is that linked to the phone number ending in 7 
7 
8 A 
Q I believe so, yes. 
Did you use any other encrypted applications to 
9 communicate with anybody between November 2020 and January 2021? 
10 I'm thinking of Wi ckr, WhatsApp. I suppose Facebook could fit 
11 in that category. Any of those? 
A Wickr. 12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 Q And was that account, Wickr account, was that also 
associated or linked to your phone number ending in 
A I don't believe so. 
Q Okay. Is that linked to a phone number? 
A 
Q 
A 
Q I don't believe so. 
Is it linked to an email account? 
Yes. 
Andis that linked to your email account 
21 A Yes. 7 
7 
22 Q Any other applications, phone numbers, or email account 
23 that you used to communicate that would be relevant to the 
24 November 2020 election in that timeframe we just identified? 
25 A I did have an alternate phone number that I used for the  1 campaign. 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 Q Do you still use that phone number? 
A No. 
Q What was that phone number, if you remember? 
A I do not remember. 
Q Do you remember what the area code was? 
A It was either --I don't recall. 
Q Okay. 
A 
Q 
A It was either or 
Okay. So a D.C.-area-type phone number? 
Yes.

16 Mr. Warrington.

4 M r . W a r r i n gt on . Al l r i g h t , 1111, we ' re b a c k . So r r y . 
Nope. That's quite all right. 
BY 
Q Okay. So we spoke al ittle bit earlier about your role 
5 and some of your job duties or functions on the Trump campaign 
6 before the election. Did have you a formal role with the Trump 
7 reelection campaign, or whatever that entity became, after the 
8 November 3rd Presidential election? 
9 
10 A 
Q Fifth. 
I really couldn't hear you there. I'm sorry. Did you 
11 say "Fifth"? 
12 
13 A 
Q Yes. 
Okay. 
14 Between November 3, 2020, and January 2021, did you ever 
15 participate in any discussions involving Sidney Powell or Jenna 
16 Ellis related to election fraud or irregularities in the 2020 
17 election? 
18 
19 A 
Q The Fifth. 
In that post-election period between November 3, 2020, 
20 and January 20, 2021, did you have any conversations with any 
21 White House officials, including President Trump, related to 
22 potential election fraud or other irregularities in the 2020 
23 e l e c t i on ? 
24 
25 A 
Q The Fifth. 
Did you, Mr. Roman, have any role investigating  1 allegations related to purported election fraud or 
2 irregularities in the 2020 election after the election took 
3 place? 
4 
5 A 
Q The Fifth. 
The same period, post-election through January 20, 28 
6 2021, did you have any conversations with any elected officials, 
7 whether at a State, local, or Federal level, regarding election 
8 fraud or irregularities in the election? 
9 
10 A 
Q The Fifth. 
Did you ever talk with anybody at the Department of 
11 Homeland Security in that post-election period, November 3rd 
12 through January 20th, about the election or any purported fraud 
13 or irregularities? 
14 
15 A 
Q The Fifth. 
Same period, between November 3, 2020, and January 20, 
16 2021, did have you any conversations with current or former 
17 officials at the Department of Justice regarding purported 
18 election fraud or irregularities in the 2020 Presidential 
19 election? 
20 A The Fifth. 
21 Q And do you have in your possession, Mr. Roman, evidence 
22 of widespread fraud that actually affected the outcome of the 
23 2020 Presidential election? 
24 
25 A The Fifth. 
Q Where were you on election day, so November 3, 2020?  29 
1 [Witness conferring with counsel.] 
2 Mr. Warrington. So, -I think, with regard to that 
3 question, there's been some --I don't know if your question has 
4 been informed by some press articles. In particular, there's 
5 one, I believe it was a Politico article, that is just flat wrong. 
6 But you and I can talk about that offline. Or, after the 
7 deposition, I can give you some background on that. 
8 Mr - Okay. Yeah, I'd be interested in hearing what 
9 it is you have to say about that. 
10 But for Mr. Roman, so are you instructing him not to answer? 
11 Or --I shouldn't put that it way, but I just --I guess I'll 
12 just renew my question. 
13 BY 
14 Q Regardless of whatever' s been reported, where were you, 
15 Mr. Roman, on election day? 
16 Mr. Roman. The Fifth. 
17 And, Mr. Warrington, I'll fol low up with you, 
18 t hen , a f t e r w a rd s . 
19 
20 
21 
22 Mr. Warrington. Yes. 
- Okay. 
BY 
Q I'm going to show you some exhibits, Mr. Roman, like we 
23 b rough t up be f o re on the s c re en . The f i rs t i s ex h i bi t No . 3 . 
24 All right. Can you see that, what we pulled up as exhibit 
25 No. 3?  30 
Yes. 1 
2 A 
Q All right. This is an email from Mike Roman to Alex 
3 Cannon. Do you know who A lex Cannon is? 
4 A Yes. 
5 Q Who is that? 
6 A The Fifth. 
7 Mr. Warrington. , can we see the entire document? 
8 Of course. Let's scroll down. 
9 And then the only thing on that second page is just that 
10 Trump Victory signature block. 
11 Mr. Warrington. Okay. Thank you. 
12 BY 
13 Q So this is an email exchange between you and Alex Cannon 
14 late on the evening of November 5th and into the morning of 
15 November the 6th. 
16 A I'm sorry. Could you repeat that? I couldn't hear 
17 you. 
18 Q Yes, of course. And it wasn't a question yet. 
19 But this is an email exchange between you and Alex Cannon 
20 late on the evening of the 5th and into the morning of the 6th. 
21 And it begins with a report sent by an RNC employee to Mr. Cannon 
22 providing a comparison of the 2020 Presidential election results 
23 in four cities to those same cities' results in 2016 and 2012. 
24 That's that chart there at the bottom. 
25 The RN C employee notes that , quote , "AT L i s h i g he r i n 2 0 2 0 ,  31 
1 but GA has approximately 2 million more voters on their rolls 
2 compared to 2016." 
3 And then just further describing this, in the top email 
4 there --if you could zoom in a little bit so Mr. Roman can see 
5 it. Yep. 
6 In that top email, you wrote, quote, "Only Atlanta 
7 overproduced in raw votes. The margin was higher in three of 
8 four. Not sure that satisfies the narrative." 
9 And so my question to you is: In this email, why was the 
10 focus these four cities --Philadelphia, Atlanta, Milwaukee, and 
11 Detroit? And, again, this email exchange is dated between 
12 November 5th and November 6th of 2020. 
13 
14 A 
Q The Fifth. 
And, then, in that email, you say, "Not sure that 
15 satisfies the narrative." What was the narrative you're 
16 referring to here in response to Mr. Cannon's email? 
17 
18 A 
Q The Fifth. 
You can take that down. Thank you. 
19 When was first time you recall using language like "stop 
20 the steal " or refer r i n g to the elect i on as potent i ally be i n g 
21 "stolen" in relation to the 2020 Presidential election? 
22 A The Fifth. 
23 Q Can we pull up exhibit 24, please? 
24 And while that's coming up, were you ever directed to or 
25 asked to use l an g u age l i k e the elect i on i s " go i n g to be stolen "  32 
1 or it "will be stolen" before the Presidential election ever 
2 occurred? 
3 
4 A 
Q The Fifth. 
Exhibit 24 --can you see that there? --it's a tweet 
5 from your @mikeroman account. 
6 
7 A 
Q The Fifth. 
Okay. The first thing I just want to make sure is you 
8 can see it. Can you see what we've shown as exhibit No. 24? 
9 
10 A 
Q Yes, sir. 
Okay. 
11 Mr. Warrington. Can we see the whole document,_ 
12 Yes. This is just one page. I think you're 
13 seeing the whole thing. You are. 
14 Mr. Warrington. Okay. Thank you. 
15 BY 
16 Q And this is a tweet dated July the 1st of 2020, so a few 
17 months before the election, in which you said that now President 
18 Bi den and o the rs we re go i n g to rec r u i t goons to , quote , " steal 
19 the elect i on . " 
20 Were you asked by anyone in the Trump reelection campaign, 
21 White House, or otherwise to put out tweets like this July 2020 
22 tweet even before the election occurred? 
23 
24 A 
Q The Fifth. 
And what information did you have in July 2020, around 
25 the time you sent this tweet, to support the claim that the  33 
1 election was going to be stolen? 
2 A The Fifth. 
3 Q If we could pull up exhibit No. 4, please. 
4 Okay. Can you see what we've pulled up on the screen as 
5 exhibit 4? 
6 
7 A 
Q Some of it. 
Okay. Let's scroll down. This is only one page. I'll 
8 represent to you there is a page 2 but it's only the byline, or 
9 the signature line, "Paid for by Donald J. Trump for President." 
10 We can show that to you quickly. 
11 So, in this email, it looks like a mass mailing email sent 
12 by the campaign on November 7, 2020, a little less than a month 
13 before the Presidential election. And the "from" line includes 
14 your name, Mike Roman, National EDO Director, from an email 
15 address@team.donaldtrump.com. And the subject line is "Stop 
16 elect i on fraud . " 
17 The first question I have for you: Did you write this 
18 email? 
19 
20 A 
Q The Fifth. 
Because this looks, at least to me, like it's kind of 
21 a mass, like, marketing or outreach email. Did you have any role 
22 in approving this message before it went out using your name, 
23 from Mike Roman, National EDO Director? 
24 A The Fifth. 
25 Q The em a i l st a rt s , i t says , " E le ct i on f r au d i s real. "  34 
1 That first paragraph there under the name "Laura," it says, "The 
2 Democrats are busy changing the way ballots are cast and counted 
3 in order to create chaos and confusion. Their goal is to steal 
4 th i s elect i on f r om the Ame r i can people . They want to steal f r om 
5 you." 
6 What evidence did you or the campaign have that you' re aware 
7 of at this time in October of 2020 that Democrats were motivated 
8 by creating, quote, "chaos and confusion" and were going to have 
9 a goal of stealing the election? 
10 A The Fifth. 
11 Q All right, you can take that down. Thank you. 
12 All right. So I want to go to some tweets from election 
13 day itself. 
14 If we could pull up exhibit No. 5. 
15 This is just one page as well. This is a tweet from your 
16 account on November 3, 2020, which is election day, at 9:12 in 
17 the morning is the timestamp. 
18 And it says, "Illegal campaigning inside of a polling 
19 location in Philly. Man in blue is handing out Dem literature 
20 to voters in line to vote. This is why Dems are keeping Trump 
21 watchers out. They are stealing it. This needs to stop." 
22 Did you take either of the pictures that appear in this tweet 
23 from your account on November 3rd? 
24 
25 A The Fifth. 
Mr. Warrington. -can we see the entire --that may  35 
1 be 
2 -- This is the whole thing. 
3 Mr. Warrington. Yeah. 
4 Yep, that's the whole thing. 
5 Mr. Warrington. It's just, where the sound bar is on the 
6 screen, it actually kind of covered up the bottom. 
7 Oh, I see what you're saying. I apologize. 
8 Mr. Warrington. No, that's fine. I think it's on our end. 
9 Sorry about that. 
10 BY 
11 Q Did anyone encourage you to tweet about the election 
12 being stolen the afternoon of election day, so on election day 
13 itself? 
The Fifth. 14 
15 A 
Q Did you do anything to investigate the activity you 
16 tweeted about here in this tweet in exhibit No. 5? 
17 A Fifth. 
18 Co u l d I a s k --
19 Yep. 
20 Mr. Roman, do you have any information about 
21 whether the two photos that appear side-by-side in this tweet 
22 
23 
24 
25 were actually taken at the same 
Mr. Roman. The Fifth. of the same instance? 
You can take that down. Thank you.  36 
1 Q What's your understanding about how the Trump campaign 
2 investigated allegations of alleged election fraud in the 
3 November 2020 Presidential election after the election took 
4 place? 
5 
6 A 
Q The Fifth. 
Do you have any proof, Mr. Roman, of widespread 
7 intentional vote flipping using any voting machines, including 
8 Dominion voting machines? 
9 
10 A 
Q The Fifth. 
Do you have proof that enough dead people voted in any 
11 State or a combination of States to change the outcome of the 
12 election? 
13 
14 A 
Q The Fifth. 
Do you have proof that any purported irregularity in the 
15 Presidential election actually changed the election in any 
16 State? 
17 A The Fifth. 
18 Q I do w a n t to p u l l u p ex h i b i t No . 9 . 
19 All right. Can you see that we've pulled up exhibit No. 9 
20 on your screen? 
21 And if we go to the bottom of page 1 --this is just a one-page 
22 email as well, or one-page exhibit I should say. If you zoom 
23 in just a little bit at the bottom so we can see the --it's a 
24 December 18th email. 
25 Can you see what we're showing you here as exhibit No. 9?  37 
Yes. 1 
2 A 
Q All right. So this first email is from somebody named 
3 James Fitzpatrick at Donald Trump --or, excuse me, with the 
4 email address jfitzpatrick@donaldtrump.com. 
5 Who's James Fitzpatrick? 
6 A The Fifth. 
7 Q All right. 
8 The subject line of this email exchange, as you can see there 
9 in the bottom email, is "Updated fraud examples in Arizona, 
10 Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, New Mexico, Nevada, 
11 Georgi a." Looks to be a file name . doc, meaning "document." 
12 And Mr. Fitzpatrick told you, "See attached" --excuse me --sent 
13 this to you, yes, and said "See attached." 
14 And then, if we go up, you forward it along to somebody named 
15 Jason Miller. And Mr. Miller responds, "Thank you, Mike." And 
16 he asks you a question: "Safe to say this takes the best verified 
17 examples we have from you, Navarro, Cleta, etc, and this is our 
18 top -s he l f s t u f f , you ' d be f i n e w i t h o u r d i s t r i bu t i n g p u b l i c l y ? " 
19 And if we go up one more --still on the 18th. And then 
20 on, at least according to this timestamp, which is the 19th at 
21 1:30 a.m., you write back to Mr. Miller, copying Mr. Boris 
22 Epshteyn, saying, "This is the stuff we can validate, either a 
23 news a rt i cl e o r a c red i bl e a ff i d av i t . " 
24 Do you recognize this email exchange that we have here as 
25 ex h i b i t No . 9 ?  1 
2 A 
Q The Fifth. 
In this email, based on what you recall and the 
3 attachment and discussion surrounding it, is this the most 38 
4 comprehensive record of the results of your and the campaign's 
s efforts to compile and validate allegations of fraud that arose 
6 in the 2020 Presidential campaign? 
7 
8 A 
Q The Fifth. 
You can take that down. Thank you. 
9 So we understand that, eventually, Rudy Giuliani and a team 
10 that worked with him took over the campaign's post-election-day 
11 legal team. How did that affect your responsibilities, if any? 
12 A The Fifth. 
13 Can we take a break to get some coffee? 
14 Mr. Warrington. -could we just take about a 30-second 
15 break to get some coffee? 
16 Yeah, of course. You want to just say 
17 5 minutes --
18 
19 
20 
21 Mr. Sure. 
for a coffee break? 
Mr. Warrington. Yeah. 
All right. Then we'll go off the record and 
22 take 5 minutes. 
23 
24 Mr. Warrington. Okay. 
[Recess.]  39 
1 
2 [11:00 a.m.] 
3 BY 
4 Q It's 11:00 a.m., and we are resuming the deposition of 
5 Mr. Michael Roman. 
6 I was about to go through a list of people and ask if you 
7 discussed anything with them after Mr. Giuliani took over kind 
8 of the legal efforts on the campaign or after election day more 
9 generally. So I'm just going to list them all and see if you 
10 communicated with any of them. 
11 So did you communicate after the election with Sidney 
12 Powell, Cleta Mitchell, Jenna Ellis, John Eastman, Christina 
13 Bobb, Ken Chesebro, or Jack Wilenchik? 
14 A The Fifth. 
15 Q Okay. I would ordinarily ask you to describe any 
16 communications you had with each, but I'm going to assume, based 
17 on your answer to the last question, that you will assert a 
18 privilege to that question. Is that correct? 
19 
20 A 
Q Yes. 
Going back to the pre-election period, so before 
21 November 3rd, 2020, what was your understanding of the role of 
22 State legislatures in the process of electing the President of 
23 the United States in choosing the electoral college electors? 
24 
25 Mr. Warrington. We're pre-election, right? 
Pre-election, correct.  40 
1 The Witness. I was not focused on that? 
2 BY 
3 Q Okay. So you weren't focused on it. Did it come up at 
4 any point that you recall before the November election? 
5 A No. 
6 Q I assume I know the answer to this question, but are you 
7 aware of any discussions before the election about the Trump 
8 campaign potentially encouraging State legislatures in 
9 battleground States to appoint Trump electors. So, again, 
10 discussions before the November 3rd election? 
11 
12 A 
Q The Fifth. 
And, to the extent there were those discussions, who was 
13 involved in any such discussions before the election about the 
14 Trump campaign potentially encouraging State legislatures to 
15 c ho o s e T r ump e l e c to r s ? 
16 
17 A 
Q The Fifth. 
Did you ever participate in any efforts to encourage 
18 State legislators in Pennsylvania or elsewhere to select Trump 
19 electors in States that Mr. Trump had lost? 
20 A The Fifth. 
21 Q Pull up exhibit No. 7, please. 
22 All right. So these are --
23 Mr. Warrington. What's the exhibit number on this? 
24 This is No. 7. 
25 Mr. Warrington. 7?  41 
1 Yeah. You produced this to us. It is 
2 starting Bates Roman 19 through Roman 26. 
3 BY 
4 Q Okay. These are approximately, based on my rough 
5 count, 25 messages that you exchanged with someone named Matt 
6 Stroia between November 21st and December 4th. Were these 
7 messages sent via Signal from your phone? 
8 A The Fifth. 
9 Q And, just to be clear, these messages are messages that 
10 you provided to the committee itself. Are you going to 
11 take --assert the Fifth amendment to any questions about these? 
12 Mr. Warrington. Not to interrupt, but if your 
13 questions is, if he's going to do that, I'm going to 
14 let --obviously let him answer, but I just want to make sure 
15 that's you're talking about this string of emails or texts? 
16 Mr. That's correct. On this exhibit in 
17 particular. 
18 The Witness. The Fifth. 
19 
20 Q BY MR. 
Maybe I will just ask you more generally then. Outside 
21 the context of this exhibit, who is Matt Stroia? 
22 A The Fifth. 
23 Q I understand that somebody named Matt Stroia was the 
24 chief of staff to Representative Mike Kelly at the time, so, in 
25 the Nov em be r , Dec em be r and J an u a r y p e r i o d that we ' v e been ta l k i n g  42 
1 about. Is that your understanding as well? 
2 A The Fifth. 
3 Q We go to page 3 of this exhibit, which is Bates stamped 
4 Roman 0021. It shows a message that Mr. Stroia sent to you on 
5 November the 22nd. And it looks like this message relates to 
6 purported legislative hearings --or excuse me --a purported 
7 legislative hearing held a few days later in Gettysburg, 
8 Pennsylvania, and it is talking about: Rudy we are hoping it 
9 turns out --excuse me --Mr. Stroia said: I hope it turns out 
10 like we envisioned. We need to make --oh, excuse me --we need 
11 to push hard to make it in person. 
12 And you respond about the Federal courthouse maintained by 
13 GSA. 
14 What role did Mr. Stroia play in organizing election fraud 
15 he a r i n gs o r p u r po rte d he a r i n gs i n Penns y l van i a a round th i s t i me? 
16 
17 A 
Q The Fifth. 
My fol lowup question, what was your role in coordinating 
18 or arranging or organizing any hearings in Pennsylvania around 
19 this time? 
20 A The Fifth. 
21 Q If we go to page 4 of this exhibit, again, you produced 
22 these messages to us. And this is Bates stamped Roman 0022, this 
23 shows the messages exchanged again between you and Mr. Stroia 
24 now on November 8, 2020. You ask: Who briefed the PA House 
25 caucus last name Adams.  43 
1 Mr. Stroia says: I have no idea. Could it be the general 
2 counsel for the speaker? 
3 You respond: No, apparently, it is Michael Adams, the SOS 
4 from Kentucky. Does that make sense? And it doesn't sound like 
5 this went well. 
6 And you attach an apparent screen shot of several other 
7 messages in which somebody says: Maybe the Trump campaign 
8 should get some actual evidence of fraud and file in court. 
9 They've been horrible in their court filings. We just got a 
10 report from their legal team. They told us on caucus they have 
11 zero evidence. 
12 What do you know about the briefing discussed here in which 
13 the apparent secretary of state from Kentucky briefed the 
14 Pennsylvania House caucus? 
15 
16 A 
Q The Fifth. 
And who sent you the messages that you took a screen shot 
17 of and sent them to Mr. Stroia that are shown here on Bates No. 
18 Roman 0022? 
19 
20 A 
Q The Fifth. 
The embedded message says that, quote, they told us in 
21 caucus they have zero evidence, end quote. Are you aware of such 
22 a statement by any members of the Trump campaign team or the Trump 
23 campaign legal team on which Mr. Giuliani worked? 
24 
25 A 
Q The Fifth. 
Did you ever hear Mr. Giuliani or anybody else  44 
1 associated with the campaign indicated that Mr.Giuliani and his 
2 team didn't have evidence but did have theories about the 
3 election and purported fraud? 
4 
5 A 
Q The Fifth. 
On page 7 of this same exhibit, exhibit 7, and this is 
6 page Roman 0025, for the record. Mr. Stroia said: The mayor 
7 may be calling you. Christina told me he's wanting to talk to 
8 me about Pennsylvania. My mind is in no shape to talk with him 
9 right now. I told him that you will know everything I do. Did 
10 you speak with Mr. Giuliani on or about December 4th about 
11 election issues in Pennsylvania? 
12 
13 A 
Q The Fifth. 
Do you know why Mr. Giuliani would have been calling Mike 
14 Kelly's chief of staff, Mr. Stroia, about Presidential election 
15 i s sues rat he r than you , who was act i n g as the d i recto r of elect i on 
16 day operations for the campaign? 
17 A The Fifth. 
18 Q In this message it mentions Christina. Is that 
19 Christina Bobb? 
20 
21 
22 Bobb? 
23 
24 A 
Q 
A 
Q The Fifth. 
Do you know how often Mr. Stroia interacted with Ms. 
The Fifth. 
Did Mr. Stroia or Representative Kelly assist in any 
25 efforts to have State legislators choose Trump electors in  45 
1 Pennsylvania after the November 2020 election? 
2 A The Fifth. 
3 Q Did you ever talk to Representative Kelly about having 
4 Pennsylvania State legislature choose Trump electors? 
5 A The Fifth. 
6 Q If we go to exhibit No. 8. This is another exchange that 
7 you provided to us. And that's Bates stamped Roman 0004 through 
8 Roman 0012. And these are messages somebody named Katherine 
9 Friess. Can you see the exhibit that we put up on the screen 
10 there, at least the first page of it? 
11 A I can't see all of it. 
12 Q Okay. We can zoom in to relevant portions there. 
13 Again, these are nine pages of texts you exchanged with Ms. 
14 Friess between November 24th and January 1st, and it is 
15 approximately 30 messages. Were these sent through your Signal 
16 account or sent or received with your Signal account, I should 
17 say? 
18 
19 A 
Q The Fifth. 
And, again, I would just note for the record that, 
20 because you produced these to us, we think that these are fair 
21 game for questioning outside of any Fifth Amendment privilege 
22 assert i on . I understand you are assert i n g the Fi ft h . If you ' d 
23 like a moment to talk to Mr. Warrington about that, that's 
24 perfectly fine, and take as much time as you need, but that is 
25 the committee's position.  46 
1 Mr. Warrington. I understand the committee's position. 
2 And I think our position is laid out in our prior correspondence 
3 with the chairman. 
4 
5 
6 ~ Okay. Thank you, Mr. Warrington. 
BY 
Q All right. So just a few questions to fol low up on this 
7 for the record here. Is this Katherine Friess, who assessed Rudy 
8 Giuliani' s legal team? 
9 
10 A 
Q The Fifth. 
In the message on page 2, go to page 2, Ms. Friess says: 
11 In your inbox, my guys and then lists a few people. Stisogis, 
12 Colonel Waldron, Kim Peterson, Charles Nudo, and his 84-year-old 
13 mother-in-law. It appears she's sending information about 
14 potential witnesses for Pennsylvania election fraud hearings. 
15 I s t h a t co r rec t ? 
16 
17 A 
Q The Fifth. 
And what was her role in setting up the purported 
18 he a r i n gs i n Pen n s y l v a n i a ? 
19 
20 A The Fifth. 
Q Who, if anyone, was responsible for investigating the 
21 allegations of election fraud or irregularities that came up or 
22 that were presented by witnesses at that hearing? 
23 
24 A 
Q The Fifth. 
On page 5 of this exhibit, which for the record is Roman 
25 0 0 0 8 , M s . F r i e s s s a y s t h a t s he ' s on w i t h Be r n i e , j u s t s h a red .  1 Thanks a bunch. 
Do you understand that to be Bernie Kerik? 
A The Fifth. 47 
2 
3 
4 Q On the next day, December 27th, she says: Tracking 
5 something down for the mayor and POTUS. Have you seen anything 
6 that shows over vote numbers from Michigan or Pennsylvania, 
7 especially Pennsylvania, and/or Detroit, Philly, Pitt? Thanks 
8 so much. 
9 You respond and say: I know. We were looking at this as 
10 we were discussing recounts. Let me see where it was left. 
11 They says: Thanks a million. 
12 And then the next day you say: Saw POTUS' tweet. Is that 
13 what you were referring to? 
14 And, if we go on to the next page, which is Roman 9, she 
15 i n t he m i d d l e of t he page re s pond s a n d s a y s : Yep , t h a n ks . 
16 There is a tweet that the President issued on December 28th 
17 I will represent to you, Mr. Roman. It says: In Pennsylvania, 
18 there were 2,005 --excuse me --205,000 more votes than there 
19 were voters. This alone flips the State to President Trump. 
20 Is this the tweet you remember seeing when you wrote on 
21 December 28th "saw POTUS tweet"? Is that what you were referring 
22 to? 
23 A The Fifth. 
24 Q You also said that your team had been looking at this. 
25 Di d you eve r le a r n that th i s i s sue of 2 0 5 , 0 0 0 al leg e d o v e r votes  48 
1 was debunked and that there weren't such over votes in 
2 Pennsylvania? 
3 A The Fifth. 
4 Q Did you ever have any discussions with the President or 
5 anybody on the campaign, including Mr. Giuliani and his team, 
6 that this over vote allegation had in fact been debunked? 
7 A The Fifth. 
8 Q On page 7 of this exhibit, which is Roman 0010, Ms. 
9 Friess mentioned Mastriano. Did you understand that to be State 
10 Senator Doug Mastriano? 
11 
12 A 
Q The Fifth. 
Did you, Mr. Roman, ever speak with State Senator Doug 
13 Mastriano about the election? 
14 
15 A 
Q The Fifth. 
Did you ever speak to State Senator Doug Mastriano about 
16 the joint session of Congress on January 6th? 
17 
18 A 
Q The Fifth. 
Did you ever speak to Senator Mastriano about his 
19 presence in Washington, D. C. , on January the 6th? 
20 A The Fifth. 
21 Q All right you can take this down. Thank you. 
22 Did you have any role directing Trump campaign staffers or 
23 volunteers to make calls to Republican State legislators after 
24 the November election? 
25 A The Fifth.  49 
1 Q Did you have any role in drafting or approving scripts 
2 that such staffers or volunteers would use when speaking with 
3 Republican State legislators after the election? 
4 A The Fifth. 
5 Q I do want to show you exhibit No. 10. If you can zoom 
6 in a bit. Showing you exhibit No. 10, can you see the top of 
7 the first page of exhibit No. 10 on your screen? 
8 
9 A 
Q Yes. 
Okay. So, at the top it says: Hard sell. Support the 
10 resolution to appoint electors for Trump. 
11 It says: Basic script. 
12 And then it starts with a script that says: 
13 Representative/Senator blank. 
14 We can scroll down to show you the rest of this document. 
15 Stop the re and j us t go up . Good . 
16 So part of this script says: Tomorrow, Mayor Giuliani is 
17 presenting experts and witnesses from Arizona who will show the 
18 vote totals are fatally flawed and do not accurately represent 
19 the will of the voters. 
20 It goes on to say: You have the power to reclaim your 
21 authority to send the slate of electors that will support 
22 President Trump and Vice President Pence. This is a clear path 
23 to correct the attempted theft of this election. This effort 
24 is happening in other States where fraud was rampant, including 
25 Pen n s y l v a n i a , Ar i z on a , a n d Geo r g i a ?  50 
1 There's more to it as well. But do you recognize what this 
2 document is, that says "hard sell, support the resolution to 
3 appoint electors for Trump"? 
4 A The Fifth. 
5 Q As I just read, it includes a mention of Mr. Giuliani 
6 and presenting experts and witnesses from Arizona. Did you have 
7 any role coordinating Mr. Giuliani's appearance before 
8 legislators in Arizona in the post-election period? 
9 
10 A

11 in this script? 
12 
13 A 
Q The Fifth. 
Do you know if anyone actually cal led State legislators 
14 to convey the information in this script? 
15 
16 A The Fifth. 
Q Were you directed by anyone within the Trump campaign 
17 or White House to make cal ls like these or have others, campaign 
18 volunteers or staff, make calls like these? 
19 
20 A 
Q The Fifth. 
Did you ever talk to President Trump about calling State 
21 legislators and encouraging them to appoint 
22 Trump electors in States that he had lost? 
23 A The fifth. 
24 Q Did you ever talk to President Trump about other options 
25 for changing or affecting the results of the 2020 Presidential  51 
1 election? 
2 A The Fifth. 
3 Q Were you involved in any other efforts to urge State 
4 legislatures or State legislators to appoint electors, including 
5 by reconvening for special legislative sessions, if necessary? 
6 A The Fifth. 
7 Q If we go to exhibit No. 11. This is --and I'll 
8 start --excuse me. Can you see the top part of the first page 
9 of what we just pulled up is exhibit No. 11? 
10 A Yeah. I can see the top, yes. 
11 Q Okay. This is an email exchange between you on December 
12 2nd, 2020, with Tim Murtaugh, Jenna Ellis, Boris Epshteyn, and 
13 G. Michael Brown. The subject line: Michigan reporter 
14 question. 
15 And we go to the bottom of page 2. The Michigan reporter 
16 question appears to be: Is the Trump campaign responsible for 
17 emails from Kerrick Kuder and voicemails from Angela McCallum 
18 to Michigan lawmakers, urging them to appoint their own electors 
19 from Jonathan Oosting in Michigan. 
20 After several emails, we get back to the near the top of 
21 page 1. Mr. Murtaugh asked you and others: So what is the 
22 answer actually? Is the campaign pushing emails and voicemails? 
23 And you respond: The campaign did send emails and 
24 voicemails. MR. 
25 Was Tim Murtaugh aware of these calls or emails to State  52 
1 legislators before they happened? 
2 A The Fifth. 
3 Q Jenna Ellis is somebody who is on this email exchange 
4 and who actually weighs in at one point. Was she aware of these 
5 cal ls and emails either before or as they were happening to State 
6 legislators? 
7 
8 A 
Q The Fifth. 
More generally, whose idea was it to place cal ls to State 
9 legislators?

16 voting machines?

23 th rough St a t e off i c i al s , me m be rs of M r . G i u l i an i ' s legal team , 
24 or anybody else? 
25 A The Fifth.  Q Are you aware of an individual named Phil Waldron?

6 
7 Q Quickly I will show you exhibit No. 26. And this is the 
8 extent of the exhibit. This is Bates stamped R-O-M-A, ending 
9 in 645, a document that you produced. It says: ASOG, Phil 
10 Warren, 200k electronically adjudicated ballots. Novis 
11 software, defaulted ballots to Biden. 
12 Can you see the exhibit that we have up there, Mr. Roman? 
13 
14 
15 
16 A 
Q Yes. 
What is this? This is something you produced. 
Mr. Warrington. Can you scroll down,_ 
Yes. This is the extent of the entire 
17 exhibit, but yes. 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 The Witness. What was the question? 
BY 
Q What is this document? 
A The Fifth. 
Q In that it says Phil Warren, W-a-r-r-e-n, is that 
23 actually a reference to Phil Waldron, W-a-l-d-r-o-n? 
24 
25 A 
Q The Fifth. 
All right. You can take that down. Thank you.  54 
1 So we talked a little bit about State legislators choosing 
2 Trump electors in States that Mr. Trump had lost. But, 
3 separately, are you aware of a plan to have Republican electors 
4 meet and cast votes for Donald Trump in States that Mr. Trump 
5 had lost, separate and apart from any efforts related to State 
6 legislatures? 
7 
8 A 
Q The Fifth. 
For ease of use and shorthand, I'm going to refer to the 
9 folks who did that as alternate electors. And so, when I use 
10 that term, that's what I'll be referring to. 
11 Why was it necessary for alternate electors to convene in 
12 States that Mr. Trump had lost? 
13 A The Fifth. 
14 Q And what was your role, if any, in having alternate 
15 elect o rs meet i n St ates that M r . Trump had lost , i n cl u d i n g 
16 Pennsylvania? 
17 
18 A 
Q The Fifth. 
Did you discuss the alternate electors plan with 
19 President Trump either before or after the electors met and cast 
20 votes on December 14th, 2020? 
21 A The Fifth. 
22 Q Did you discuss the concept of or process for convening 
23 al t e r n ate elect o rs i n contested St ates w i th any of the fol low i n g 
24 people , J us ti n Clark , Matt Morgan , Josh Fi n d lay , or Ni ck Tr a i n er? 
25 A The Fifth.  55 
1 Q And same question: Did you ever discuss this concept 
2 of or process for convening alternate electors with Rudy 
3 Giuliani, Boris Epshteyn, Jenna Ellis, John Eastman, Bernie 
4 Kerik, Christina Bobb, Judge James Troupis, Mike Brown --G. 
5 Michael Brown, or Robert Sinners? 
6 
7 
8 A The Fifth. 
Q Pull up exhibit No. 12, please. 
All right. So we're putting up exhibit No. 12. Can you 
9 see the top of the first page of exhibit 12 on your screen? 
10 
11 A 
Q Yes. 
This is a memo to Judge James Troupis from Kenneth 
12 Chesebro or Chesebro, dated November 18th, 2020, in brackets, 
13 12/10 streamlined version, re: The real deadline for setting a 
14 State's electoral votes. 
15 And then Mr. Chesebro introduces it by saying: Here is a 
16 summary of my view that the Presidential election timetable 
17 affords ample time for post-election judicial proceedings. 
18 Have you ever seen this memo before? 
19 Mr. Warrington. Can you scroll through it, -
20 Sure. 
21 
22 Q And if we go back to the top of page 1 and at least scroll 
23 through it, that second paragraph under the summary --I'll just 
24 read the beginning of it. It says: Assuming the electors 
25 pledged to Trump and Pence end up meeting in a State on December  56 
1 14th to cast their votes and then send their votes to the 
2 President of the Senate in time to be opened on January 6th, a 
3 court decision or perhaps a State legislative determination 
4 rendered after December 14th in favor of the Trump-Pence slate 
5 of electors should be considered timely. 
6 So now having scrolled through this and heard at least that 
7 portion of it, do you recognize this memo dated November 18th? 
8 A The Fifth. 
9 Q Was the portion I just read to you from that second 
10 paragraph on page 1 consistent with what you are told about the 
11 alternate electors and the plan to have them meet? 
12 A The Fifth. 
13 Q Did you have any concerns about the meeting and casting 
14 votes by alternate electors on December 14th, 2020? 
15 A The F i ft h . 
16 Q If we go to exhibit 13. This is another memo. It is 
17 a separate memo, dated December the 9th, to James Troupis from 
18 Kenneth Chesebro. And it is: Re: Statutory requirements for 
19 December 14th electoral votes. 
20 I'll represent to you, as we' re scrolling through it, that 
21 Mr. Chesebro in this memo goes through Federal law as well as 
22 various State laws from Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, 
23 Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin and talks about the different State 
24 law requirements for the meeting of electoral college electors 
25 related to the Presidential election. Do you recognize this  1 memo shown as exhibit 13? 
2 
3 A 
Q The Fifth. 
Did you participate in any discussions about legal 57 
4 issues related to the meetings of Republican electors in various 
5 States? 
6 
7 A 
Q The Fifth. 
If we go to exhibit No. 15, please, and this is just a 
8 one-page email, if you scroll up a bit --excuse me, scroll down, 
9 rather. The end is a signature block from Joshua Findlay. Can 
10 you see what we put up as exhibit No. 15? 
11 
12 A 
Q Yes. 
And this is an email, dated December 11th, 2020, at 5: 52 
13 p.m., from Joshua Findlay to John Black, Clayton Henson, B. 
14 Barrett, Jeremy Hughes, Brian Seitchik, copying Kenneth Chesebro 
15 and you, Mr. Roman, with the subject: Presidential electors 
16 l i ti g at i on i n the St ates . 
17 And, in this email Mr. Findlay wrote: Rudy's team has 
18 designated Ken Chesebro as the point person for the legal 
19 documents and Mike Roman as the lead for executing the voting 
20 on Monday. Both are copied here and can assist in resolving 
21 outstanding issues in your State. 
22 Is i t accurate that Mr . G i u l i an i des i gnat e d you as the le ad 
23 for executing the voting by alternate electors in advance of 
24 December 14th in the meeting of the electoral college? 
25 A The Fifth.  58 
1 Q And it says that you had been designated as the lead for 
2 executing the voting. How did you execute the effort for the 
3 voting of alternate electors on December 14th? 
4 
5 
6 A The Fifth. 
Q We'll go to exhibit No. 16. 
All right, this is a December 12th email, at least the top 
7 email here. Can you see the top of page 1 for exhibit 16 that 
8 we've put up? 
9 A Yes. 
10 Q All right. We'll scroll down. This is a two-page 
11 email. It starts with an email from you on December 12th to James 
12 Fitzpatrick, Sean Flynn, Jesse Law, Thomas Lane, Valerie 
13 McConaughey, G. Michael Brown, Robert Sinners, and Peter 
14 McKi nnes (ph). 
15 Are those members of your election day operations staff? 
16 
17 A 
Q The Fifth. 
You can take that down. Thank you. 
18 So we understand that the campaign and advisers to the 
19 campaign drafted language for the alternate electors to use in 
20 certificates that were ultimately sent to Congress and the 
21 National Archives. That language indicated that the alternate 
22 electors were the, quote, duly elected and qualified electors 
23 for President and Vice President. 
24 Are you aware of anyone who expressed concerns about using 
25 that language?  59 
The Fifth. 1 
2 A 
Q It's been reported publicly that Pennsylvania State 
3 Senator Doug Mastriano wanted assurances about the plan for the 
4 alternate electors to meet and cast votes and wanted to speak 
5 directly with Mr. Giuliani to ensure that the plan was legal. 
6 Are you aware of any of Senator Mastriano's concerns about the 
7 alternate electors? 
8 
9 A 
Q The Fifth. 
It's also been reported that Arizona GOP chair Kelli 
10 Ward and Arizona State Senator Kelly Townsend also had concerns 
11 about the alternate electors plan and that, according to an email 
12 written by Mr. Chesebro, quote, Ward and Townsend are concerned 
13 it could appear treasonous, end quote. 
14 Did you ever learn about any concerns that Ms. Ward or 
15 Senator Townsend had about the convening of alternate electors 
16 in Arizona? 
17 
18 A The Fifth. 
Q We go to exhibit No. 18. This is a one-page email --or 
19 one-page exhibit rather, excuse me --with an email from 
20 Mr. Chesebro to you, Mike Roman, as well as Josh Findlay on 
21 Saturday, December 12th, at 7:12 p.m. Can you see the exhibit 
22 we've put up as exhibit 18? 
23 
24 A 
Q Yes. 
Okay. And the subject for this email is: Tweet 
25 language for certificate.  60 
1 And Mr. Chesebro wrote to you saying: Mike, here is my 
2 suggested language for dealing with the concern raised in the 
3 PA conference call about electors possibly facing legal 
4 exposure, parenthesis, at the hands of a partisan AG, close 
5 parenthesis, if they seem to certify that they are currently the 
6 valid electors. 
7 And then he offers language with some strikeouts and 
8 balding. Do you recognize this email? 
9 A The Fifth. 
10 Q Did you discuss the purported fix that Mr. Chesebro 
11 wrote in this email with anyone, including Mr. Chesebro? 
12 
13 A 
Q The Fifth. 
At the end of this email, just above his signoff there, 
14 it says: It strikes me that if inserting these few words is a 
15 good idea for Pennsylvania, it might be worth suggesting to 
16 electors in other States. 
17 Do you know why electors in at least some other States did 
18 not do the same and amend the language in the alternate electors 
19 certificates that were sent to Congress and the Archives? 
20 
21 A 
Q The Fifth. 
If we go to exhibit No. 20, please, this is a few pages 
22 of emails. The top one in includes you, Ryan Terrell, Charles 
23 Nichols, Andrew Hitt, Mark Jefferson, Kenneth Chesebro, G. 
24 Michael Brown, Clayton Henson, Andrew Iverson, and Nathan 
25 Trueblood , w r i t ten on Nov em be r --excuse me , Dec em be r 16th , 2 0 2 0 ,  61 
1 at around 11:22 a.m., with the subject line: Mailing the 
2 packages for Monday's meeting. 
3 Was this email exchange about mailing the alternate 
4 electors votes to the President of the Senate, the Archives, and 
5 others? 
6 
7 A 
Q The Fifth. 
I'll just note for the record, the bottom of page 1 of 
8 this exhibit, it does talk about packages being mailed to the 
9 President of Senate, the U.S. Archivist, secretary of state, and 
10 district court. And that's an email from Mr. Nichols at the 
11 Wisconsin GOP. 
12 In this exchange, on page 2, you asked for confirmation that 
13 the packages have been sent. And then Mr. Terrell says, quote: 
14 The timing of the delivery is sensitive for the campaign. 
15 And that's at the top right there where the cursor is, in 
16 the top email on page 2. My question is, first, what was 
17 Mr. Terrell's role in the alternate elector effort? 
18 
19 A 
Q The Fifth? 
Second, why is the timing of the delivery of these 
20 alternate elector votes sensitive? 
21 
22 A 
Q The Fifth. 
You can take that down. Thank you. 
23 D i d you eve r l ea r n t h rough d i rec t con v e r s a t i on o r o t he r w i s e 
24 that the former President wanted alternate electors to submit 
25 electoral college votes in States that he had lost so that the  62 
1 Vice President, Vice President Pence, could choose them during 
2 the joint session of Congress on January 6th? 
3 
4 A 
Q The Fifth. 
Beyond mailing or having these electoral college 
5 alternate votes mailed, did you help in any way to get physical 
6 copies to the Capitol, the U.S. Capitol? 
7 A The Fifth. 
8 Q Did you ever speak with Matt Stroia, then chief of staff 
9 to Representative Kelly, in the days before January 6th regarding 
10 the delivery of documents to the Senate Parliamentarian's 
11 Office, the U.S. Senate to be clear? 
12 A The Fifth. 
13 Q Were the documents you discussed with Mr. Stroia the 
14 alternate elector votes? 
15 
16 A 
Q The Fifth. 
Are you aware of anybody, including yourself, actually 
17 delivering those votes to Mr. Stroia before the joint session 
18 of Congress on January the 6th? 
19 A The Fifth. 
20 Q If we go to exhibit No. 22, if you could zoom in on this, 
21 this is a one-page exhibit consisting of text messages sent to 
22 somebody named Michael B. My understanding, I'll represent to 
23 you, is that that's Mike Brown. Did you work with somebody named 
24 Mike Brown or G. Michael Brown? 
25 A The Fifth.  63 
1 Q In this exchange, Mr. Brown informed the other person, 
2 Angela McCal lum, that he had, quote, just landed and that he had, 
3 quote, never flown clutching his bag before, end quote. He 
4 actually says "clutching my bag before," and he explained that 
5 the reason why he flew clutching his bag was because he, quote, 
6 didn't want to let the docs out of his sight. 
7 Do you know what documents Mr. Brown was flying with in the 
8 days before the joint session of Congress and that he says he 
9 was clutching here? 
10 
11 A The Fifth. 
Q We go to exhibit No. 23. This is two pages of text 
12 messages that we'll scroll through between Mr. Brown, Angela 
13 McCallum, and Madison Crawley. On this first page, you can see 
14 here Mr. Brown sends a photo of himself wearing a suit and a mask 
15 with the U.S. Capitol over his shoulder, and he writes, quote: 
16 Mission accomplished about to Uber home, end quote. 
17 And, regarding the photo, he said, below the picture, quote: 
18 This has got to be the cover of a book I write one day, end quote. 
19 And, if we go to the next page, he continues, if you can 
20 zoom in on the middle of page, and he says, quote: I should 
21 probably buy Roman a tie or something for sending me on this one. 
22 Hasn't been done since 1876, and it was only three States that 
23 did it. 
24 Question for you is, did you send Mr. Brown, Mike Brown, 
25 to Wash i n gt on to de l i v e r any documents i n the days be f o re J an u a r y  1 6th? 
2 
3 A 
Q 64 
The Fifth. 
And for what purpose did you send Mr. Brown to 
4 Washington, as he says here, apparently to deliver documents? 
5 
6 A 
Q The Fifth. 
All right, you can take that down. 
7 In the weeks leading up to January 6th, Professor John 
8 Eastman wrote several memos addressing the Vice President's 
9 authority to count or not count certain electoral votes during 
10 the joint session of Congress based in part on the existence of 
11 purportedly competing slates of electoral votes sent in by these 
12 alternate electors. 
13 Did you discuss the role of the Vice President during the 
14 joint session of Congress with Professor Eastman? 
15 
16 A 
Q The Fifth. 
Did you discuss the role of the Vice President during 
17 the joint session with Boris Epshteyn? 
18 A The F i ft h . 
19 Q And did you ever discuss the role of the Vice President 
20 du r i n g the j o i n t session w i th Mr . Chesebro , Mr . G i u l i an i , or 
21 anybody else? 
22 A The Fifth. 
23 Q Before January 6th, 2021, did you know that the 
24 alternate electors' votes would be cited as a means of putting 
25 pressure on Vice President during the joint session of Congress  65 
1 to count or not count certain electoral votes? 
I'm sorry. Can you ask that again? 2 
3 A 
Q Yeah, sure. So, before January 6th, 2021, the day of 
4 the joint session, did you know that the alternate electors votes 
5 would be cited as a means of putting pressure on or encouraging 
6 Vice President Pence during the joint session of Congress? 
7 
8 A 
Q The Fifth. 
Did you talk to anyone in the White House, including the 
9 President, about the President's efforts to have Vice President 
10 Pence count or not count certain votes during the joint session 
11 of Congress on January 6th? 
12 A The Fifth. 
13 Q Did you have any role in drafting, encouraging, sending 
14 or delivering letters from State legislators to Members of 
15 Congress , the Depa rt men t of J us t i c e o r the Vi c e P res i dent rel ate d 
16 to elect i on fraud or the J an u a r y 6th , 2 0 21 , j o i n t s es s i on of 
17 Congress? 
18 
19 A 
Q The Fifth. 
If we bring up exhibit No. 25, please. This is a 
20 one-page exhibit. It's a tweet. It's fairly big, but it is from 
21 your account @MikeRoman with a picture of people in front of the 
22 Washington Monument. And this was posted on January 6th, 
23 a cc o rd i n g to the t i me stamp , at 11 : 0 6 a . m . 
24 First of all, can you see the exhibit we put up as exhibit 
25 No. 2 5?  1 A Yes. 
2 Q And, in this tweet, there are the hashtags 
3 FightForAmerica, FightforTrump and January6th. Do you 
4 recognize this tweet from your public Twitter account? 
5 
6 
7 
8 A The Fifth. 
Q Were you in Washington on January 6th, 2021? 
A The Fifth. 
Q Did you take this picture of the crowd with the 
9 Washington Monument in the background on January 6th, 2021? 
10 A The Fifth. 66 
11 Q Did you attend the President's rally on the Ellipse in 
12 the morning of January 6th and into the first part of the 
13 afternoon? 
14 
15 
16 2021? A 
Q The Fifth. 
Did you go to the Capitol at any point on January 6th, 
17 A The Fifth. 
18 Q Have you talked to anybody who went to the Capitol on 
19 J an u a r y 6th , 2 0 21? 
20 A The Fifth. 
21 Q And, whether before, on, or after January 6th, so at any 
22 point, did you discuss the rally on the Ellipse with anyone who 
23 worked in the White House at the time, including President Trump? 
24 A The Fifth. 
25 Q At any time, whether before, on, or after January 6th,  67 
1 did you discuss the President's rally on the Ellipse with Mr. 
2 Giuliani, Ms. Bobb, Ms. Ellis, Mr. Eastman, Mr. Chesebro, or 
3 anybody working with Mr. Giuliani' s legal team? 
4 A The Fifth. 
5 Q Do you know why the President encouraged his supporters 
6 to go to the Capitol on January 6th, including in his speech? 
7 A The Fifth. 
8 Q I'm going to stop there and see if anybody has any 
9 followup questions to what we've gone over. 
10 No, nothing for me. Thank you. 
11 
12 Q So, Mr. Roman, at this point, we will see if there is 
13 anything that you would like to add for the record and give you 
14 the opportunity to add anything that you would think is helpful 
15 to the select committee's investigation. 
16 A No. 
17 Q And, just for the record, these are the questions that 
18 we ' v e gone o v e r . I t ' s been about an ho u r and 4 5 mi nut es o r so 
19 since we began. These are not necessarily all of the questions 
20 that we would have asked, but, based on your answers to certain 
21 of the questions, it looks like several areas of inquiry would 
22 involve you asserting the Fifth. And so, in that case we're 
23 go i n g to ref r a i n f r om o the r quest i on s , but we have d i s cussed many 
24 topics here today. 
25 And I think, at this point, unless there is anything that  68 
1 you, Mr. Warrington, would like to put on the record or any of 
2 the other attorneys who represent you, Mr. Roman, I think we'll 
3 be near conclusion. 
4 Mr. Warrington. We don't have anything further other than 
s what was contained in our correspondence with the chairman and 
6 obviously the assertions made today. 
7 ~ Okay. Thank you, Mr. Warrington. 
8 Then, at this point, I think we can recess subject to the 
9 call of the chair and conclude the deposition. 
10 Mr. Warrington. And we would put on the record our 
11 objection to that. Our position is that Mr. Roman has fulfilled 
12 his obligations under the subpoena. 
13 Thank you. That will be noted. And then we 
14 can go off the record. 
15 [Whereupon, at 11:46 a.m., the deposition was recessed, 
16 subject to the call of the chair.]  1
