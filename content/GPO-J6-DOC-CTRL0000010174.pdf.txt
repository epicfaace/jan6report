Dear Maj or General Walker: 
As you know, First Amendment demonstrations permitted by the National Park Service 
are scheduled to occur in the District of Columbia on Tuesday, January 5, 2021 and 
Wednesday, January 6, 2021. As a result, District Government requests DC National 
Guard (DCNG) support, as these demonstrations will follow similar events on November 
14, 2020 and December 12, 2020, which resulted in a large influx of participants, 
violence and criminal activity. 
The District of Columbia is requesting personnel from the DCNG. Further, DCNG will 
support operations for both the Metropolitan Police Department and the DC Fire and 
Emergency Medical Services. Finally, no DCNG personnel shall be armed during this 
mission, and at no time, will DCNG personnel or assets be engaged in domestic 
surveillance, searches, or seizures of US persons. 
Director Christopher Rodriguez of the District's Homeland Security and Emergency 
Management Agency will provide the requirements of and more details related to the 
mission. I request that you immediately connect with Director Rodriguez to discuss this 
critical request. Thank you for your immediate assistance.
