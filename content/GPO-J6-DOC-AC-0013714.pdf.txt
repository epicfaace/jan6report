HELP PRESIDENT TRUMP STOP CORRUPT PHILADELPHIA DEMOCRATS FROM STEALING THE ELECTION! 
#STOPTHESTEAL 
%%FirstName%%, 
You are receiving this email because you are one of PRESIDENT TRUMP'S most staunch supporters. 
We NEED your help to watch CORRUPT Philadelphia Democrats from stealing the election. 
TRUMP watchers at the mail ballot count at the Philadelphia Convention Center have been denied 
meaningful observation of ballots throughout this SHAM of a process. TRUMP observers simply want to 
be able to monitor whether an ILLEGAL vote was counted or not, as they are entitled to by law. 
PLEASE COME HELP WATCH THE COUNT. Your work will ensure that no illegal votes are counted. Details 
below: 
WHEN: Tuesday, November 10th and each following day until complete 
WHERE: Philadelphia Convention Center, meet at the corner of 12th and Arch Street, Phila, PA 19107 
WHY: To help to monitor the counting of ballots 
HOW: Please email Lauren Casper at kasper(wdonaldtrump.corn with your name, email, and phone 
number to obtain access 
THANK YOU FOR HELPING TO #STOPTHESTEAL 
Sincerely, 
TEAM TRUMP PENNSYLVANIA

%%FirstName%%, 
Joe Biden does not get to decide when this election ends. Only LEGAL ballots must be counted and 
verified 
The OBSERVERS were not allowed, in any way, shape, or form, to do their job and therefore, votes 
accepted during this period must be VERIFIED to determinel they were -·LEGAL VOTES. 
The media does NOT get to decide who is PRESIDENT! 
President Trump knows that YOU are one of his most reliable supporters, which is why we're reaching 
out to you for your input on a quick one-question poll. 
This poll will be LIVE for the NEXT HOUR. Make sure to submit your response as soon as possible. 
Thank you, 
Team Trump 2020
