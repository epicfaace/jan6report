focus on curing ballots and 
raising funds to support the 
legal actions, then winning GA 
Senate seats and nothing else 
right now. These idiots are 
letting Biden play their

Possibly. Its the only day I'm in 
the office that week (we are in 
DC Mon-Weds for the WH Xmas

Friday, so I may end up with a

I expect that we'll get ruled

clearly biased toward the 
state ... so not sure 1f its a good 
use of time. 
I need to find out if it will be

that there was no evidence.

Don't misunderstand me about 
the courts. My guess is that 
courts will rule in some states 
that the corrupt results swing it 
to Trump. Recall the attorney on 
our call answered one of my 
questions by saying that the 
court could simply direct 
Sisolak to follow NV law after 
they give the election to Trump, 
NV law requires them to certify

Congress will consider those 
court opinions but aren't bound

The court can't order them to do 
anything. Congress decides. 
Pence will preside and likely our 
people would get the facts to 
him to reveal in open session. 
Some in Congress will bitch but 
should work out OK 
So then it's left to the Senate 
and House to rely on objections 
by our friendly Senators and 
Congressman and hope to get a 
vote to set a state aside. Not a 
very hopeful proposition .... 
If this works, some states will

I certainly want to ask Jesse 
about these questions at 
hearing Friday. LOTS of 
uncharted territory as you said 
I know more how some things 
should go from an originalist 
perspective, but we know that 
isn't always the case. That the 
PA Legislature offered that 
resolution to take back their

super fucking cool and exactly

Senate would vote to toss

not, even if the fraud was

I think that it's political pressure

unbelievably corrosive. These 
judges are going to feel enough

and not look political. All along I 
don't think these protest people

part of our case, that AB4 was 
not followed regarding 
signature checks. But we can 
no longer use that to determine 
what votes should be tossed 
because Gloria destroyed that 
evidence by separating the 
envelopes from the ballots. So 
we can't flip the results with 
that; best we can do is show 
that it cannot be determined 
who those votes were cast for. 
As I recall, when we sued on 
that to require human 
comparison before the election 
the lawsuit was tossed not on 
it's merits, but because the 
Trump campaign didn't have 
standing to sue. That should 
leave it ripe for litigation now 
that we as electors can show 
we were harmed.

The legislator's direction is in 
298. 65 and 298.075. While it's 
not stated that the meeting will 
take place in the SOS office, it is 
strongly implied. 
And the parts in 298.075 that 
discuss marking ballots, 
presenting them to Babs to 
double check and approve etc. 
are physically impossible in a

Been trying to read through 
some detail. Pretty fucking 
discouraging. The Electoral 
Count Act of 1887 provides that 
once the official elector's votes 
of a state are determined, only 
those may be counted, period, 
dot. As I see it, ours should be 
in the pile to be opened from 
Nevada and then the letter and 
official seal or whatever will set 
the Dems apart from ours. They 
have pretty clear language that 
determination of the official 
state is fully the purview of the 
state. Other than making noise

Heard nothing from Binnall 
since he went to DC to testify 
this week. Issue was that we 
could petition NV Supremes for 
reconsideration using all the 
evidence, but they were unlikely

possibly some equal protection

The only home lies with Mo 
Brooks and his cast of 18 in the 
House and Senators Paul, Cruz, 
Lankford, etc. who may choose 
to bring objections. But even if 
they bring them, it requires a 
majority in both the House and 
Senate to sustain them, and I 
seriously doubt that we have a 
majority in either chamber. 
I think the best we can hope for 
is that enough disputed 
delegations are rejected entirely 
to deny Biden 270, but since the 
House is majority Dem and they 
know what happens if the 
actual election comes to them 
for a vote, I can't imagine the 
House choosing to reject any 
state delegation.

Exactly. We'll be 52-48, and you 
just listed enough to reverse the 
advantage. And you did so 
without mentioning Ben Sasse. I 
don't like our odds of upholding 
an objection Senate or House, 
quite frankly. 
This would require even more 
pressure than got played in 
2006 when Rush Limbaugh 
started a fire that burned down 
phone lines and such to kill 
Bush, McCain, Dem amnesty 
before offered on floor. 
Sasse rhymes with ass, how

That was a meeting between 
the state party, Binnall and the 
state party's attorney. To 
discuss the proper method of 
moving forward to torch 
Cegavske and Aron over their 
assertion that there is no fraud 
and we should move along. 
We learned that Binnall's fear of 
us going after Aron and 
Cegavske is that they would 
immediately turn around and 
start an investigation of us for 
filing false claims of fraud. 
Claims that they would prove 
were false by digging through 
the 100,000 reports until they 
found a few hundred which 
were explainable and had no 
fraud, and then report publicly 
that they had checked a sample, 
found no fraud, and so all the 
re orts are therefore fraudulent

forth as to who shot and killed 
the woman and why. As usual, 
our side completely sucks at 
messaging. Went to V.C. and 
hung out with Jim and Carolyn 
at their place then went to the 
pizza joint for chow. Good 
discussion. Will be interesting 
to see how the dust settles out.

I've seen no credible 
information describing the 
mental state or any state of the 
AF Veteran killed. 
She was apparently a woman 
with significant military training. 
If her situational awareness 
was so out of whack as to allow 
her to enter the Capitol with that 
mob, unarmed, she was 
undeniably not operating at full 
ca acii.

I'll reserve further comment as 
I've been aware since yesterday 
that I'm experiencing intense 
emotions, of a nature I've not 
experienced before caused by 
recent events. I spoke for 
perhaps 3-5 minutes yesterday 
at the Capitol but can only 
remember about 10% of what I 
said. A few trusted friends in 
the audience said I did a great 
job and I'll trust their reports, 
but I have to admit I'm in a 
strange place mentally. Hanging 
with the Hindle was relaxing.

We talked some politics as we 
all do when gathered, but we 
seemed to for once take more 
joy from talking about family, 
good memories, food, laughs, 
anything but politics. And, that 
was very relaxing.
