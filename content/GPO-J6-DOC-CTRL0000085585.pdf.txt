[EXTERNAL ] Additional Presidential Phone call follow up 
During my conversation with the President this morning he asked me to check with key leadership in 
Michigan's Legislature as to how supportive they could be in regards to pushing back on election 
irregularities and potential fraud. He wanted me to gauge their willingness to talk with him about 
efforts to bring about transparency and integrity in Michigan's election and report back to him. 
I've had conversations with Speaker Lee Chatfield, Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, and Senate 
President Pro Tempore Arie Nesbitt. They all assured me they would look forward to speaking with the 
Presiden t to report on their continuing efforts which include the subpoena of key state elections 
administration, and receiving any suggestions from President Trump. 
I stand ready to give any additional assistance that would be helpful.
