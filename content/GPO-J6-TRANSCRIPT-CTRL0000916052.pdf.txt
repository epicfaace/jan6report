3 We can go on the record at 10:04. 
Good morning. This is a deposition of Mr. James Watkins conducted by the 
4 House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States 
5 Capitol pursuant to House Resolution 503. 
6 At this time, Mr. Watkins, can you please state your full name and spell your last 
7 name for the record? 
8 The Witness. James W-a-t-k-i-n-s. 
9 - Great. Thank you. 3 
10 And at this time, Mr. Watkins, can you now raise your right hand to be sworn in by 
11 the official reporter? 
12 The Reporter. Do you solemnly declare and affirm under the penalty of perjury 
13 that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing 
14 but the truth? 
The Witness. Yes, of course. 15 
16 Sorry. Could you repeat that, Mr. Watkins? 
17 The Witness. I said, yes, of course. 
18 - Great. Thank you. 
19 So, as I mentioned before, this will be a staff-led deposition. My name i~ 
20 -and I'll be leading the deposition. I'm an investigative counsel with the select 
21 committee. Members may, of course, join to ask questions, although there are no 
22 members in the Webex right now, and I will announce any members if they join. 
23 
24 With me from the staff in the Webex today are 
professional staff member 
25 - staff associate. nvestigative counsel; 
chief clerk; and- 1 The Witness. And please understand I'm hard of hearing, so I may ask you to 
2 repeat things many times. 
3 - Sure. 
4 The Witness. I wear hearing aids, but they're mostly for decoration. 
5 Chief Clerkllllwho? 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 The Witness. -
Yes,_ 
The Witness. --1111? 
Uh-huh. And I want to --
The Witness. And the reporters, they're doing the transcripts, right? 
- Yes. So we have members of the reporting staff who are taking the 
13 transcript that you'll be able to review. 4 
14 The Witness. Okay. I'm good. I just want to know who I'm talking to. That's 
15 all. 
16 - Sure. So Mr .• and I will be questioning you today. And if 
17 anyone else comes on, whether a member or staff who may be questioning you as well, 
18 then we will be sure to introduce them. 
19 The Witness. Thank you. 
20 - And at this point I want to note for the record that what has 
21 previously been marked as exhibit 1 is the subpoena for Mr. James Watkins, which is 
22 dated May 18th, 2022, and the House deposition rules are included in this exhibit and 
23 were provided to you upon service of the subpoena. 
24 
25 The Witness. Have you received my letter about the subpoena? 
- Indeed. And we have marked --entered that into the list of our  1 exhibits. I believe it's --
2 
3 
4 The Witness. Which exhibit number is that? 
Hold on one moment. 
It's exhibit 25. So we can enter that into the record as exhibit 25, and we did 
5 receive that last night. 
6 
7 
8 The Witness. Thank you so much. 
There you go. You can see it right there. 
Thank you, Ms.-. 5 
9 And under House deposition rules, you are permitted to have an attorney present. 
10 So at this point could counsel for the witness please state their names for the 
11 record? 
12 
13 Mr. Barr. Hi. This is Benjamin Barr with Barr & Klein PLLC. 
Mr. McDonald. And Tony McDonald with the Law Offices of Tony McDonald. 
14 - Thank you. 
15 And I want to remind you as well, as we do with all of our witnesses, that it is 
16 unlawful to deliberately provide false information to Congress and that providing false 
17 information to Congress could result in criminal penalties, including for perjury and/or 
18 providing false statements. 
19 And then I want to briefly touch on the issue of objections. Under House 
20 deposition rules, you may only refuse to answer a question to preserve a privilege that is 
21 recognized by the select committee, such as the Fifth Amendment. If you refuse to 
22 answer a question based on a privilege, staff may either proceed with the deposition or 
23 seek a ruling from the chairman on the objection. If the chairman overrules your 
24 objection, you'll be required to answer the question. 
25 Mr. Watkins, my goal today is to ask you questions that are relevant to the select  6 
1 committee's investigations with the hope that you will answer. If you do have an 
2 objection or a privilege assertion, we'll ask that you or your counsel assert it for the 
3 record. 
4 I will seek to clarify the basis for each objection. I understand that you may be 
5 invoking some objections today, and if you do, please just know that our goal is to ask you 
6 questions that are relevant to our investigation and that we want to fairly evaluate any 
7 objections that you may raise. At the end of the day, the more detail you're able to 
8 provide us about the basis for an objection, the easier it will be for the select committee 
9 to consider it. 
10 In addition, under House deposition rules, select committee members and select 
11 committee staff may not discuss the substance of the testimony you provide today unless 
12 the committee approves release of the transcript of this deposition. You and your 
13 attorney will have the opportunity to review the transcript before there is any release. 
14 
15 
16 The Witness. You said you were going to provide me with the transcript. 
No. So you'll have the opportunity to review the transcript. 
The Witness. But before, 5 minutes ago, you said you were going to provide me 
17 with the transcript. 
18 - I'm not sure what I said 5 minutes ago, but under House rules, you'll 
19 be given the opportunity to review the transcript. 
20 The Witness. Yeah. Remotely or do we have to go to Washington, D.C., to view 
21 it? 
22 - At this point I believe we are offering in-person, in camera review. 
23 And I want to also state for the record --
24 
25 The Witness. Thank you so much for that. 
You're welcome.  1 And I also want to state for the record that , investigator with the 
2 select committee, has joined the Webex. 
3 And as I noted earlier, no other recordings of this proceeding are permitted. So 
4 at this point, Mr. Watkins, can you just confirm for the record that you are not making an 
5 audio or video recording of this deposition? 
6 
7 
8 The Witness. Yes. 
Thank you. 
Before we get started, I want to describe a few logistics. We've touched on 
9 some of these before. 
10 There is an official congressional reporter who is transcribing this deposition, and 
11 this reporter is also joining us via Webex. Please wait until each question is completed 
12 before you begin your response, and I'll try to do the same and wait until you finish your 
13 response before I ask another question. 
14 The reporter cannot record nonverbal responses, like the shake of a head or the 
15 nodding of a head. So there may be times when I prompt you to provide a verbal 7 
16 response, and I may have to do the same to myself. And there may also be times when I 
17 spell a name or a word or ask you to spell a name or a word for the record. 
18 We ask that you provide answers that are complete based on the best of your 
19 recollection, and if a question is not clear or you cannot hear the question, please just ask 
20 for a clarification before answering. And if you do not know an answer to a question, 
21 simply say so. 
22 And please let us know, as I mentioned before we went on the record, whether 
23 you need any breaks. I will plan to take a break around every hour. 
24 
25 Throughout the deposition we'll be referring to exhibits that will be shared on the 
screen by When we refer to a document, please take your time to  1 familiarize yourself with it before we start discussion of it. 
2 Is all of that clear? 
3 
4 
5 
6 The Witness. Yes, sir. 
- At this point, can we pull up exhibit 1, 
Great. 
So as you can see, this is the subpoena that was sent to you by the select 
7 committee. Do you recognize this subpoena as the one that was sent to you, Mr. 
8 Watkins? 
9 
10 The Witness. That must be it. 
- Great. Thank you. 
11 And you understand that you're appearing for this deposition today pursuant to 
12 the subpoena? 
13 The Witness. Yes, sir. 
14 Well, any other questions before we get started with some 
15 preliminary questions? 
16 The Witness. Yeah. Very little of anything in that subpoena actually pertained 
17 to me. So are you wanting my opinion on things? I'm just a little bit confused as to 
18 why you want me in your --to be viewed. I've already been to Congress before and 
19 most of the things that were pertinent came out then. Why are we doing this again? 
20 I understand that you had a deposition with the Homeland Security 
21 Committee a few years ago. And pursuant to House Resolution 503, we're looking at 
22 specifically the causes and circumstances that led to the January 6th attack on the 
23 Capitol. 
24 
25 The Witness. I understand that, sir. 
So we're trying to ask you questions --8  9 
1 The Witness. -I understand that. But in the subpoena, they talk about 
2 things from that prior Homeland Security thing again, especially things that I've already 
3 been to court for and been dismissed of. So I didn't appreciate that at all. So, you 
4 know, it's a problem. 
5 - So I appreciate the compliance with the document production 
6 requests in the subpoena so far. What we are trying to do is understand the 
7 circumstances that led up to the attack, as I said earlier, and that does include questions 
8 about 8kun as were in your subpoena. 
9 I apologize if some of these questions are similar to questions you received 
10 already. This is a different investigation, a different committee, and we will ask some of 
11 those same questions as well. 
12 If there are informational documents that you have already produced to us that 
13 have some of these answers, which I know there was a primer you gave to us that you 
14 also gave to the Homeland Security Committee, please feel free to refer us to those 
15 documents or discuss information that was already provided in those documents. 
16 But we want to ask you some of those questions because they're also extremely 
17 relevant to our investigation of how the attack on the Capitol came about. And so if 
18 there are questions that are repeated, I ask that you just answer them to the best of your 
19 ability. 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 The Witness. Yes, sir­
Q Thank you, Mr. Watkins. 
EXAMINATION 
B~ 
So I'll just ask a few background questions to get started.

8 
9 A I'm 58 years old. 
Q Thank you. 
And where do you live now? 
A In California. 
Q How long have you lived in California? 
A Since the Homeland Security subpoenaed me. 
Q Okay. So that would be 2019? 
A Was that when it was? 
Q I believe. 
A Yeah. 
Q Have you ever served in the military, Mr. Watkins? 
A I have. 
Q When? 
A In the '80s and '90s. 
Q Great. Thank you. 
What about law enforcement? 
A I was in the police reserves in Wheeling, West Virginia. 
Q And was that after your military service? 
A It was concurrent. 
Q Okay. Thank you. 10 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 And one last question preliminary. Have you ever been employed by the Federal 
22 Government? 
23 
24 
25 A In the U.S. Army. 
Q Sorry. I should have clarified. Aside from the Army. 
A No.  11 
Q Thank you. 
So if you could just explain for us what your role in 8kun is and your title. 1 
2 
3 A 8kun is a website that's owned by my company, and I'm the president of the 
4 company. 
5 
6 Q Okay. Do you have any other titles or responsibilities with 8kun itself? 
A Well, I'm the only one responsible for 8kun, I guess, because I'm the only 
7 employee of my company. 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 Q Okay. Understood. What is the name of that company? 
A Is It Wet Vet, Inc. 
Q Great. Thank you. 
When did you first acquire 8kun? 
A I didn't acquire 8kun. I made 8kun. 
Q Okay. So when did you first acquire 8chan, which is, as I understand it, the 
14 predecessor website to 8kun? 
15 A I don't have the exact date. Maybe you could ask me --fill me in on that. 
16 I don't recall the exact date. 
17 
18 
19 Q 
A I believe it was around 2015. Does that make sense? 
Somewhere around then, yes. 
Q Okay. Great. Thank you. 
20 And when you acquired 8chan in 2015, what was your son's role, Ronald Watkins' 
21 role, in the website at the time? 
22 
23 
24 
25 A He was one of the volunteers helping out. 
Q Okay. And you were also the administrator of that website as well, 8chan? 
A Well, the owner of it, yes. 
Q Okay. Thank you.  12 
1 And so can you describe for us briefly the nature of 8kun? What kind of website 
2 is it? What are the different functions of it? 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A It's an imageboard, sir. 
And who is able to post on this imageboard site? 
Anyone that can access it. 
It doesn't require a user name. It's an anonymous site, correct? 
Yes, sir. 
And you mentioned you were the only employee of 8kun --
Yes, sir. 
--or the company that owns 8kun? 
Yes, sir. 
How many other individuals are involved in the administration of 8kun? 
How do you mean that? I don't have any other employees at 8kun, so it's 
14 me. I'm the administrator. 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A What about volunteers --
1 can post on 8kun as the administrator. 
Right. What about other volunteers who help with content moderation? 
There are volunteers, yeah. I don't know how many there are. 
Okay. Can you give me a ballpark? 
Well, if you give me a moment, I could log in and count. One moment, sir. 
21 I'm logging in, and I'll count that. 
22 
23 Q 
A Sure. 
There are one, two --let me see how many per page. One, two, three, 
24 four, five, six, seven, eight --
25 And while we wait, Mr. Barr, I have the links ready for when we get to  1 those exhibits. So if it makes sense, I can drop them in the chat when I get to that 
2 exhibit. Does that make sense? 
3 
4 
5 Mr. Barr. That works. 
- Great. Thank you. 
The Witness. There are over a hundred volunteers, maybe approaching 200. 
6 I'm not going to count them all for you again. I'm sure you don't need the exact 
7 number. 
8 BY-
9 Q That's very helpful. And those are part of the global volunteer team that 
10 helps to moderate the content? 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 A No, that is not what that is. 
Q So what is that for? 
A You seem to be very familiar with the operations at 8kun, sir. 
Q Well, I tried to prepare for this, so we'll get to more of that in a little bit. 
A Those are the volunteers for the various boards that are on --because 
16 you've asked for volunteers. Global volunteers, there's a lot less. 
17 
18 
19 
20 Q Okay. 
A Hold on a moment. I will find my global volunteers. 
There are nine global volunteers. 
Q Nine global volunteers. So that pool of between 100 and 200 folks, that's 
21 the people who moderate different message boards on the site? 
A The site is not moderated, sir. 13 
22 
23 Q Got it. We can get into that. But the people who run the message boards 
24 on the site, the individual? 
25 A They're called the board operators.  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 Q Board operators, okay. So that's those category of volunteers. Got it. 
Do you perform any vetting of those individuals or are they also anonymous? 
A 
Q 
A 
Q They're anonymous, sir. 
Okay. How about the global volunteers? 
They're anonymous, sir. 
Okay. And one last question on this. 
Does 8kun have revenue from advertisements, or how does 8kun make money? 
A 8kun doesn't make money. I'm deplatformed. I'm not allowed to make 
9 money in the United States because there are no laws to protect me. 
Q 
A 
Q Did you ever have advertisements on 8kun? 
I have advertisements on 8kun, but they're free. I'm not paid for them. 
Okay. Thank you. 
Are you involved in approving those advertisements? 
I'm the one who puts them on. 14 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 A 
Q 
A Okay. Do you have any guidelines for what kind of ads can go onto 8kun? 
I'm the one that puts them on, sir, and no one's paying me for them, so I put 
17 them on. 
Q Got it. 18 
19 I wanted to briefly talk about 8kun's relationship to some other platforms on line, 
20 if there are any. And I wanted to --I will run through a couple of platform names, and I 
21 was curious if you can tell me if there are often links or users that come from those 
22 websites to 8kun, and if you've seen those trends change over time. 
23 Does that sound all right? 
24 
25 A 
Q You want my opinion? 
Yes. I'm asking what you've seen on the website.  1

Q

A 
Q 
A 
traffic. 
Q 
A 
overlap. 
Q 
8kun? 
A Okay. 
So the first one --
I'm happy to give you my opinion. 
The first is Gab. 
Gab? 
G-a-b? 
Yes, I have an account on Gab, @JimWatkins. 
Have you seen users or links from Gab on 8kun and vice versa? 
There's very little traffic that comes from Gab to 8kun as far as URL referral 
Okay. That's exactly the kind of information I'm looking for, so thank you. 
But there's millions of users on both platforms, so I'm sure there's some 
Right. Side note. About how many users would you say there are on 
Depending on the news, because it's a current world type thing, anywhere 
17 from 300,000 a day to 3 million a day. Today's probably going to be 3 million. 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 Q Why is that? 
A Because they know I'm talking to you, •. 
Q Got it. 
So how about Parler? 
A 
Q 
A "Parlay." 
Right. 
Parler is almost defunct. They were hacked, and they're almost defunct. 
25 So I doubt there's hardly anybody coming from Parler. 15  16 
How about in the period of 2020-2021? 1 
2 Q 
A I don't know. I doubt there was much because the Parler people generally 
3 censored 8kun links. 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 Q Okay. How about Reddit? 
A Very few people from Reddit are on 8kun. 
Q Okay. How about 4chan? 
A There's probably a lot of overlap. 
Q Okay. Why do you say that? 
A Because 4chan is a similar --it's a clone of one of my websites. And then 
10 8kun is a clone of 8chan, which is a clone of 8kun. Well, you know where I'm going. 
11 I'm a little bit lost there on my path. But they are clones that have built on each other 
12 over time. 
13 
14 
15 Q And why have the websites 4chan, 8chan, 8kun shifted over time? 
A Well, basically it's because of the administration and how they're operated. 
4chan has a lot of back in tracking on it. So most of the things that happen on 
16 4chan you and the government have ability to see readily available. I believe you buy 
17 that data. I'm not positive, but I believe you do buy that data from 4chan through 
18 Google. And that --
19 Q You don't have to worry about it, I'm not involved --
20 A Not you personally, but the government, probably one of the Justice 
21 Department branches. 
22 
23 
24 Now, 8kun doesn't have that. We don't track our users. 
Q 
A Right. 
And the people know that. So 8kun doesn't have the people that are 
25 interested in being tracked on it --or has the people that are not interested in being  17 
1 tracked on it. 
2 Q So when you do get requests from law enforcement --and we'll get to more 
3 of this later --
4 A I've provided all the requests to law enforcement that we've received to you 
5 during the time period that you stated. 
6 Q Sure. So I'm asking, are you able to provide identifying information for 
7 posts or are you not able to do that? 
8 
9 
10 
11 A 
Q 
A 
Q Very little. 
What are you able to provide? 
Usually, if it's recent, we can provide the IP of the user. 
Okay. Got it. Thank you. 
12 And I have a couple more platforms to go through, but that conversation was very 
13 useful. 
14 What about TheDonald.win, which I know is offline now? 
15 A The what? 
16 
17 
18 Q 
A 
Q TheDonald.win. It's offline now, but -­
I'm not familiar with that. 
Okay. How about any other websites in the win community? 
19 Patriots.win? 
20 
21 
22 
23 A 
Q I'm not familiar with that. 
Got it. 
What about Twitter? 
A I used to have a Twitter account. I've had several, maybe 35. I keep 
24 getting kicked off of Twitter. 
25 Q Got it.  1 
2 
3 
4 What about Facebook? 
A I haven't had a Facebook in over maybe 10 or 15 years. 
Q Okay. Discord? 
A No, I don't use Discord. I've signed into it a couple times, but I don't keep 
5 up with it. 
Q You're not aware of a large amount of overlap between 8kun and Discord? 18 
6 
7 
8 
9 A It's like a telephone service, so I'm sure that people use it. It's telephoning. 
10 
11 Q What about Twitch? 
A I have a Twitch account. I don't recall the name of it, but I have one. 
Q Okay. And Zella? 
Mr. Barr. I will remind Mr. Watkins that the question is about overlap between 
12 users on one platform coming to you. 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 don't --The Witness. Oh, those platforms are all doing different things, so --
BY-
Q Yes. So I'm --
A Yeah. 
Q The question would be, did you find links or --
A 1 have a Twitch account, and it doesn't do anything that we do on 8kun, so I 
Q Are folks, for example, posting livestreams from Twitch on 8kun? Is that 
21 something you've seen a lot of, that sort of question? 
22 
23 
24 
25 A I've actually never seen that, but it's rare --
Q Okay. Thank you. 
A I think that would be rare. 
Q Okay. And what about Zella?  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 A 
Q 
A I don't know what that is. 
Like a walkie-talkie app. It was much more active prior to --
1 built a walkie-talkie app before. It was fantastic, but nobody liked it. 
Q Sorry about that. 
And lastly, Telegram? 
A I have a Telegram account, and I'm @ShareJim on Telegram. 
Q ShareJim? 
And what about folks posting Telegram links on 8kun? 
A There's not a lot of that, I think. 
Q Okay. 
A Maybe there's some. They post my link quite often. 
Q Okay. Got it. 
13 And have you ever communicated with any of these other platforms, like Gab, 
14 about their efforts to moderate content or anything else? 
15 
16 
17 A No, sir. 
Q Okay. Got it. Thank you. 
A Well, time out. You said anything else. I think I may have talked to 
18 Andrew at Gab maybe once or twice. 
19 
20 
21 
22 Q Okay. 
A But I can't recall the conversation. 
Q Okay. Thank you. Thanks for the candor. 
So we've talked, touched on this already, but when you first were the owner of 
23 8kun, it was not 8kun. It was 8chan, correct? 
24 
25 A They're entirely different things, sir. 8chan is no longer. 
Q Okay. Can you walk us through the transition between 8chan and 8kun? 19  1 
2 
3 A 
Q 
A 20 
There was not so much a transition, sir. 
Okay. Can you explain to us what happened then? 
Your boss, Bennie Thompson, sent me a subpoena, similar to the one I 
4 received this time, on Twitter. Millions of people read that subpoena. And at that 
5 time, a guy named --last name Prince, first name I've forgotten --working for a company 
6 called Cloudflare, decided it was too much heat for his company. So he turned off 
7 8chan, and that was the end of 8chan. 8chan was no more after Bennie Thompson did 
8 that with the subpoena. 
9 
10 Q 
A Okay. 
And that was the end. And it took me months after that to rebuild the new 
11 site, and I called that 8kun, probably 3 or 4 months. 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q And was this related to the -­
That was a few years ago now. 
Was this related to the El Paso shooting? 
What about the El Paso shooting, sir? 
Was that part of the reason for the subpoena by Mr. Thompson? I'm just 
17 trying to get the timeline straight. 
18 A You know, you do realize that I went to court in El Paso and that that case 
19 was dismissed, that I had nothing to do with it. 
20 
21 Q 
A Understood. I'm just asking --
There were several shootings that I had nothing to do with in the original 
22 subpoena, but Bennie Thompson wrote it in such a way that it inferred that I was, like, 
23 responsible for them all --and I don't appreciate him at all. 
24 
25 Q 
A Understood. 
And if you want more on that, you can see the letter, exhibit 25.  1 
2 
3 Q 
A 
Q 21 
25. 
I've discussed that. 
Yes. And I've read the letter, and I understand your objections and, again, 
4 appreciate you coming to talk with us today. 
5 A Thank you. Do you have anything else on that subject then, sir? 
6 Q Well, I was going to ask about your comment when you said that it was too 
7 much heat for the company that was hosting 8chan. 
8 A That was a company called Cloudflare. 
9 
10 
11 Q 
A 
Q Right. Can you explain more about --
It was a proxy service and basically control a large part of the internet. 
Okay. And so can you explain a little more about why you thought it was 
12 too much heat? 
13 A No, he thought it was too much heat. He posted that he was going to 
14 delete it on his Twitter account. You can find Mr. Prince on Twitter somewhere, and he 
15 posted and then deleted my company from there. 
16 
17 
18 Q 
A 
Q Okay. And so when you resurrected your website as 8kun --
1 didn't resurrect it, sir. I made a new website. 
Made a new website. Were there changes in content moderation policy 
19 from 8chan to the new website, 8kun, or was it constant? 
20 
21 
22 
23 A 
Q 
A 
Q There were. 
Can you explain them for us? 
What would you like to know? Please be a little more specific. 
Sure. So were there any content moderation measures on 8chan, content 
24 moderation policies --
25 A The moderation is not really the appropriate word, because if you moderate  22 
1 your website then you've become a publisher and you're no longer a platform. So in 
2 total moderation is the wrong word. 
Q What word would you use? 3 
4 A I have come up with a new thing. Whereas before there were, like, about 
5 20,000 different boards on 8chan, and I think that 8kun has about 400. And I approved 
6 those boards before they could do that without approval. 
7 Q Okay. Sorry. So before on 8chan, they can do that without approval. 
8 They can make the boards. 
9 A Yes. For example, today I approved two --I disapproved one and I 
10 approved another. One was for a Japanese board that is --looks like it's going to be 
11 affiliated with Live Jupyter, which is one of the largest bulletin boards on Earth. And the 
12 other one I disapproved that had some woman's personal name and then it said MILF, 
13 which means mothers I would like to have sex with. 
14 
15 
16 Q Sure. We tried to stay out of that. 
A I disapproved that. 
Q So understanding that, why did you decide to make that change when you 
17 were building 8kun? 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 A Well, I told Bennie Thompson I would do that. 
Q Okay. And this is during the deposition in 2019? 
A Yes, sir. 
Q And that was an effort --I guess, tell me what you thought --
A It was my good faith effort to get Bennie Thompson off my back. 
Q Okay. Why did you think that would be effective? 
A It was ineffective because, obviously, we're still here, Mr. Glick. 
Q Was it an attempt to prevent violent or illegal content from being on the  1 website? 
2 
3 
4 
5 A 
Q 
A 
Q Whenever illegal content is on my website and it's reported, it's deleted. 
Okay. So actually that's where I wanted to go next. 
Well, that's the answer. 
Right. So if I'm understanding you correctly, the way that illegal violent 
6 content is removed from 8kun is by the report --
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Excuse me, sir? 
The way that --
Is it illegal violent content? 
Illegal or violent content. 
No, sir, illegal content. 
Okay. So can you, I guess, as a primer --
Mr. Barr. Object. Could you clarify that, maybe simplify that into -­
Sure. 
So as a first question on this, what kind of content is not allowed on 8kun? 
The Witness. The content that's illegal in the United States of America. 
Okay. So any sort of violent content that does not also --23 
18 The Witness. Sir, no. As my attorney just said, you have to separate those two 
19 things. 
20 Mr. Barr. Can you define what the committee would describe as violent 
21 content? 
22 Sure. 
23 So many social media platforms have violent content that --
24 
25 The Witness. We're not a social media platform. 
Understood. It's a message board.  24 
1 So, for example, there are platforms that forbid fighting words that are not 
2 protected by the First Amendment as violent content, incendiary, inciting content. I was 
3 wondering about that sort of content. 
4 The Witness. Well, as far as I understand, what's illegal in the United States is 
5 child porn and bestiality, crushing video --thanks to our President, Donald 
6 Trump --slander. And did I forget anything, sir? 
7 Mr. Barr. Fighting words would be. 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 The Witness. Fighting words, like inciting violence. 
BY-
Q So that was exactly what I was asking about. 
A No, that's not what you asked. 
Q Well, when I clarified the question, I immediately went to fighting words. 
13 So that is --hopefully we're on the same page for that. 
14 
15 A Yes, sir. And I'm not fighting. I just wanted to make you understand that. 
Q Okay. Well, when we talk about the First Amendment and violent speech, 
16 we're talking about fighting words. And I guess another category would be true threats. 
17 So threats against individuals or specific events, are those prohibited under 8kun's policy? 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 A Those are prohibited under United States Code. 
Q Okay. So, therefore, they would be prohibited? 
A Yes. 
Q Just trying to understand better the contours of the policy. Thank you. 
So when there is a policy --or, sorry, a post --that violates the U.S. Code, how is 
23 that reported and removed from 8kun? Can you walk us through the process? 
24 
25 A 
Q If it's reported, they click on a triangle, and there's a reporting button there. 
Uh-huh.  25 
1 A And then they put in what's wrong with it. And then it goes to a queue and 
2 it's reviewed by one of the global volunteers. And then it's either deleted or dismissed. 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 Q Right. And who makes the final call on that? 
A A global volunteer. 
Q Are you involved in that process at all? 
A Sometimes. Sometimes I act as a global volunteer as well. 
Q Okay. But it's not necessary for you to review any of that? 
A No. And there's a log of it as well. 
Q Okay. Would you be able to produce those logs to us? 
A They're public. You can download them yourself. 
- Okay. Well, Mr. Barr, if you could provide us with a link to that after 
12 this, we'd appreciate it. 
13 
14 
15 
16 that? 
17 
18 
19 
20 of --
21 The Witness. Let me send you the link now while we're talking about it. 
- And while you're doing that, , can you pull up exhibit 3? 
Mr. Barr. Is there a scope of the log that you want? Is there a time frame on 
The Witness. Well, everything is there that I have. It's all public. 
Mr. Barr. Okay. 
- So that's fine. I think we'd be most interested in the time period 
The Witness. Yeah, you'll be able to get that yourself. 
22 
23 - Sure. I was just answering your lawyer's questions. 
The Witness. I would be able to provide it to you for a fee or you can get it 
24 yourself for free. And you can go to 8kun.top/bans.html. 
25 Okay. Thank you, Mr. Watkins.  1 
2 
3 The Witness. You're welcome. 
Q So this is exhibit 3. This is the letter that you sent to us and you also sent 26 
4 to the Homeland Security Committee in 2019. So you reproduced it to us a few months 
5 ago --or a few weeks ago. And this is a primer on 8kun --or I guess primer on 8chan at 
6 that point. 
7 So in this letter there's talk of the global volunteers, which is how I knew about it 
8 before we spoke. And I just wanted to confirm that that's still the same system, 8chan 
9 to 8kun. It seems like it is. 
10 
11 A 
Q Yeah. 
Okay. And I also wanted to ask, do those volunteers, that dozen or so 
12 volunteers, including you, do they have access to all of the message boards on 8kun? 
13 Are any of them private? 
14 
15 
16 
17 A 
Q 
A 
Q They have access to all the boards. 
Okay. Are any boards private? 
Everything is accessible publicly. 
Okay. And around the time of January 6th, about how many global 
18 volunteers would you say there were? 
19 
20 A 
Q Maybe 10. 
Okay. And in terms of training those volunteers to understand the scope of 
21 the U.S. Code, is there anything that you provide to them to --
22 
23 
24 A 
Q 
A There is. 
What is it? 
I have a list of things that they can read through and learn what's permitted 
25 and not permitted.  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 Q 
A Would you be able to provide that to us? 
I would. 
- Mr. Barr, can we arrange for that to be provided to us? 
Mr. Barr. Absolutely. 
- Okay. 27 
The Witness. I can give you the guidelines now. I can read them all to you, but 
7 it's several paragraphs. I think it'd be easier for me to --
8 
9 Mr. Barr. I'll get it from you. 
The Witness. This is it here. 
10 - Okay. Well, we'll follow up on that, Mr. Barr, but --
11 The Witness. Yeah. But, yes, I do. And this is --I'm sending it to Mr. Barr now 
12 so he'll have it. I want to help you,_ 
13 I appreciate that. 
14 BY-
15 Q So there is no other way that 8kun volunteers or the global volunteers are 
16 overseeing, as we kind of talked about? They get this training, these materials, and 
17 they're able to make these calls as complaints come in? That's correct? 
18 A Yes, sir. And the anonymous members of the community keep them in 
19 check pretty much. 
20 
21 Q 
A How do you mean? 
Well, it's amazing how an anonymous people feel they have the ability to 
22 speak out and point out injustice when something happens. So they point things out 
23 when there's a problem. 
24 Q So is that in terms of needing to remove content? That's often flagged by 
25 the community?  1 A Yes, sir. The only content that's removed is that that's flagged by the 
2 community. 
3 Q Right. Are there any efforts by global volunteers and yourself to 
4 proactively look for content that might be --
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A No sir. 
--a violation of the U.S. --sorry. Go ahead. 
No, sir. 
No. Okay. Has there ever been? 
No, sir. 
10 Okay. 
11 we can take this exhibit down. 
12 Thank you. 
13 And I also want to note for the record that Candyce Phoenix, who's a chief 28 
14 counsel --sorry, a senior counsel and senior advisor for the select committee --has joined 
15 us. 
16 The Witness. Candyce Phoenix? 
17 -Yes, like the bird. 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 Ms. Phoenix. Would you like me to spell that for you? 
I have it. Thank you, ma'am. 
And can we pull back up exhibit 5, 
Q Actually, this is a different letter than before. So this is a letter that you 
23 sent to us on May 6th in compliance with the subpoena. So here you provided some 
24 more information about 8kun's content moderation practices. And on page 3 there's a 
25 reference to an automated, quote/unquote, botmod, b-o-t-m-o-d, account that looks for  1 illegal content or spam based on key words. 
2 So can you explain that system to us? 
3 
4 A 
Q Well, how in detail do you want that to be explained? 
You could start with a brief overview, and I can ask follow-up questions if 
5 there are any. 
6 A I can put in a key word, such as 128.PL or FSl.org@PDC.li nk, and it will ban 
7 that content from being posted. 
8 
9 Q 
A Okay. 
Gotocut.ru (ph), et cetera, et cetera. Those are some of the recent ones 
10 that I've banned. 
11 
12 Q Sure. Okay. Like domain [inaudible]. 
Okay. Do you ever keep track of what kind of content the botmod is taking 
13 down, how much content they're taking down? 
A 
Q 
A 
Q No. That would be --they stop it from being posted. 
Okay. 
It's a proactive. It's not a post. 
Got it. That's helpful. 
we can take the exhibit down. 29 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 And so do you ever add in --you mentioned a lot of URLs before that you have put 
20 in. Do you ever put in key words that might be related to potential events that you 
21 want to prevent from spreading on the website? 
22 
23 A 
Q No, sir. 
Okay. So it was never your intention to try to track or prevent 
24 hate-motivated mass casualty events, attack the government processes? You're not 
25 putting in those kind of key words?  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 say --
7 
8 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Excuse me, sir? 
So, for example -­
Excuse me, excuse me? 
Yes. 
I'm gravely insulted by that. Please try again whatever you're trying to 
So, for example, the mass shooting in Buffalo --
--or I'm walking out right now. That's that. I'm being polite, but if you 
9 put shit like that in and expect me to answer it again, I'm walking out. 
Q 
A I was seeking -­
Yes. Start over. 
Mr. Barr. Let him rephrase it. 30 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 Q Mr. Watkins, I was seeking to clarify if you ever used this botmod account to 
15 try to track or prevent things like racial slurs or calls to violence from being posted on the 
16 site. 
17 A This botmod is not pre-crime, sir. It's not "Minority Report." It's not Tom 
18 Cruise. Those things don't exist. 
19 Q So it's used mainly for spam, I take it. 
20 A Yes, sir. 
Q Okay. That is my question. Thank you. 21 
22 You also mentioned in your letter on May 6th --or, sorry. This is the letter to 
23 Chairman Thompson that you reproduced to us from 2019, that in 2019 you were in the 
24 process of developing on 8kun a way to restrict certain parts of the website during an 
25 emergency.  Can you explain if that process was ever completed on 8kun? 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q I explained that. I have an off button, sir. 
Okay. So will it happen --
1 can make my website read only. 
Okay. Have you ever done that, felt the need to do that? 
No, sir. 
No. Okay. 31 
1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 And just a couple more questions on this before we get into the election season. 
Who's responsible for communicating potential threats to law enforcement? Is 
10 that something that 8kun does? 
11 
12 A 
Q Law enforcement contacts me. 
Okay. Okay. And were you ever contacted by law enforcement in the 
13 run-up to January 6th about potential threats? 
14 
15 
16 A 
Q No, sir. 
Okay. Thank you. 
So at this point I wanted to move into some questions about 8kun in the run-up to 
17 the 2020 election. And I think that we can actually breeze through this fairly quickly 
18 because I expect I know the answer to all of these. 
19 So there was never any additional policies put in place throughout the 2020 
20 election, aside from your single policy that prohibits content that is in violation of the U.S. 
21 Code, correct? 
22 
23 A 
Q Yes, sir. 
Okay. And what about in terms of true threats to violence against elected 
24 officials, was there ever --I'm asking --sorry. Go ahead. 
25 A Can you give me an example?  1 Q So threats against poll workers, things of that nature, elected and 
2 government officials? 
3 
4 A 
Q I don't recall or know that that's actually happened, sir. 
So that's what I was asking. And we ask these questions --we've been 
5 asking these questions of many websites and --
6 
7 
8 
9 A 
Q 
A 
Q I understand, but I don't recall or believe that that's ever happened. 
On 8kun? 
Yes, sir. 
Okay. And that's what I was asking. So if that's the answer to the 
10 question then, please, we're interested to hear that. 32 
11 And I talked about this a little bit with your attorney. I just want to clarify for the 
12 record. There was never any policy about disinformation related to the election when 
13 the election was taking place, fraud in the election, because none of that is in violation of 
14 the U.S. Code, correct? 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 Mr. Barr. He's talking to you. He's asking -­
The Witness. He said my attorney. 
Q 
A 
Q BY 
Well, we talked about disinformation policies. 
Okay. 
Yes. And that's something we've been asking to multiple platforms. So I 
21 just wanted to confirm for the record that there was no effort to track potential 
22 disinformation/misinformation about the election. 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q No, sir. 
Okay. Got it. 
And this next question, next set of questions, is about if you perceived any  33 
1 increase in activity on 8kun. So, again, to the best of your recollection. 
2 Did you see an increase in activity on the site following President Trump's 
3 comments to the Proud Boys to stand back and stand by during the first Presidential 
4 debate? 
5 
6 A 
Q I don't recall that. 
Okay. Thank you. 
7 How about any other content in the weeks leading up to the election related to 
8 activities by groups like the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers, the Three Percenters? 
9 A I have met some Proud Boys at a demonstration in Sacramento one time. 
10 That's the only thing I've ever had anything to do with them. 
11 
12 Q 
A Okay. 
I just said, "Hi. Oh, you guys are the Proud Boys." And they ignored me. 
13 I have nothing to do with them. 
14 Q Right. Did you ever see --I'm not saying you have anything to do with 
15 them. I was asking more about whether or not content related to their activities was 
16 posted on the site. 
17 
18 
19 A 
Q I haven't tracked or I'm not familiar with that. 
Okay. Got it. 
I wanted to ask a few questions about the spread of QAnon on 8kun. And, again, 
20 these questions are mainly meant to get to the best of your recollection on these issues. 
21 So I guess my first question is, when did you first become aware of QAnon on 8kun 
22 and in what context? 
23 A Well, as far as I know, QAnon is a manufactured by the left-wing media, and 
24 it's probably put out mostly by a company called Media Matters. 
25 Q Okay. So -- And QAnon is a --is like a boogeyman. 
So what is your understanding --34 
1 
2 
3 A 
Q 
A It's manufactured. It's not anything to do with my website. I've used the 
4 term a couple times, and that's before I realized what it even was. 
5 
6 Q 
A So what was your understanding of the QAnon --
Well, from what I understand of QAnon, it's been condemned by all but 17 
7 Members of the lower house. 
8 
9 Q 
A Indeed. 
Now, when they condemned that, the most important thing in that 
10 condemnation was their agreement to not argue on anything unless they already agreed 
11 upon it. I think that was number five in it, which I thought was just thoroughly 
12 appropriate for what they've turned into. 
13 
14 Q 
A So what was your understanding of the QAnon --
If I understand it, it's generated and perpetuated by a company called Media 
15 Matters. 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Okay. 
Which is, I believe, funded by a name named George Soros. 
And when did you gain this understanding? You said at first you -­
It's been several years. 
Was it before January 6th, after January 6th? 
I knew this before January 6th, yes, sir. 
Okay. 
Can we pull up exhibit 11? 
Okay. So this is a postcard that you produced to us --
A Yes, sir.  1 
2 Q 
A --from a user of 8kun. 
I don't know what that person's a user of, sir, and I don't know his name 
3 either. All he has is a wax seal with some kind of interesting design on it. I assume 
4 that's his motto, signature. 
5 Q Okay. So I read this postcard as referring to --the free speech bastion in 
6 the second line as referring to 8kun. Is that not how you read the card? 
It doesn't say 8kun. 35 
7 
8 A 
Q Understood. But is that --he's addressing it to you, and he's saying fighting 
9 and facilitating for a free speech bastion. 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Is that a problem, sir? 
No, it's not. I'm just trying to establish that he's talking about 8kun. 
But you can't establish that's part of 8kun because it doesn't say 8kun, sir. 
Well, I was asking you --
It came from an anonymous person. 
Okay. Well, I was bringing up this exhibit because in the third line you can 
16 see that he's talking about the conversations that Anons had, and it seems to be referring 
17 to discussions of QAnon on 8kun. 
18 
19 
20 A 
Q 
A No, it doesn't say QAnons anywhere on that card. 
Can we bring up --
I'm certain it doesn't. I'm looking at it now. QAnon is manufactured by 
21 George Soros, Media Matters, and it's spread in about 2,000 different news articles by 
22 them. And they have --and if you look at all of those articles, they have about a 
23 paragraph that's, like, required, I think, to get paid for posting a story about it, and it's 
24 almost the exact same paragraph each time. 
25 Q Okay.  1 
2 A 
Q Yeah. 
Can we pull up exhibit 8? 
3 So I'm just trying to figure out a little bit more because I will admit I'm a little bit 
4 surprised by --
5 A 
6 things, so --
7 
8 
9 Q 
A 
Q 
10 QAnon. 
11 A Yeah. No, but what you said and what is in that card are two different 
Right. So I understand --
1 just wanted you to be aware of that. 
I understand we're not in agreement that that postcard is referring to 
Yeah, it's not an agreement thing. It's an actual fact. 
12 Q So this exhibit 8, this is another letter you produced to us. It says: "Hi, 36 
13 Jim." At the top it's dated August 5th, 2021, and if we scroll down to the bottom, this is 
14 not an anonymous letter. We don't have to say the person's name for the record, but 
15 this is someone who is in Washington State who sends the letter. 
16 So this is, again, something you produced to us, and it seems to be responding to a 
17 prompt --if you can scroll up to the top --about whether or not --what would happen if 
18 8kun was shut off. 
19 And so in this --again, this is 2021--In this letter the writer discusses learning 
20 about QAnon, Q research on --
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Those are not the same things, sir. 
So can you describe to me what Q research is? 
Q research is an imageboard on 8kun. 
Is it related to the QAnon theory? 
No, sir.  37 
1 Q So when he says in the third full paragraph that Q offered not just a glimmer 
2 of hope but the only glimmer of hope --
3 
4 A Can you make it larger, sir? Maybe I have this letter. I will look. 
Q So I guess, in the meantime, what is Q research and why is it called Q 
5 research if it's not related to QAnon? 
6 A Well, I didn't make Q research. Q research is made by the people that are 
7 using Q research. 
8 
9 
10 
11 Q Okay. 
A But it's a --
Q Do you know what it's referring to? 
A Yeah. It's a place where they talk about the current world affairs, and they 
12 try to research and find the meaning behind things and why they oftentimes post 
13 propaganda and how to find their way through propaganda. 
14 
15 
16 
17 Q But you're --
A It's people researching and looking into things to try to find facts. 
Q But it's your contention that it's not related to the QAnon theory? 
A The only possible way you could relate it to QAnon is the fact that that's --Q 
18 research board is --the reason that Media Matters and George Soros have invented 
19 QAnon is to make it a boogeyman. 
20 
21 
22 
23 Q Got it. Okay. Understood. So --
A They don't like people thinking for themselves. 
Q So in the third paragraph, can you see it now? 
Mr. Barr. What does it start with here? Is it "Truth is"? 
24 The paragraphs starts with: "Truth is, and I've said this for years," so 
25 I'm looking at the end of that paragraph.  1 The Witness. Okay. I can read this. "Truth is, and I've said this for years, if 
2 aliens showed up tomorrow [inaudible] take into their ship, put Earth in the rear view 
3 mirror, and step on it." 
4 BY 
5 
6 
7 Q 
A 
Q Okay. So, Mr. Watkins, if we could go to the last sentence. 
I don't believe in aliens, sir. 
Thank you. I am more interested in --I don't either --but I'm more 38 
8 interested in the last sentence: "I'm weary to my bones. Q, whatever Q is, offered not 
9 just a glimmer of hope but the only glimmer of hope I've ever seen in my life." 
10 And so that is what I was curious about. It seems like he's discussing Q on 8kun 
11 because --
12 
13 
14 A 
Q 
A Probably he is, but that's not QAnon. 
Okay. Can you describe the difference between Q and QAnon? 
Well, QAnon is a boogeyman that's invented by the propaganda wing of 
15 likely --you know, I don't know who's running it, but I know that George Soros finances it. 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A And what is Q? 
Q is one of the users on 8kun. 
And do you know who Q is? 
No, sir. 
Have you ever accessed Q's account? 
There is no account, sir. 
I thought you said he was a user on 8kun? 
Well, you can post on 8kun without being a user. 
Okay. 
It's designed that way.  1 
2 [11:04 a.m.] 
3 BY-
Okay. Have you ever had any communication with the Q account? 
There is no Q account, sir. 
Sorry. The Q user. 
No, sir. 
And you do not know --39 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 1 've had communications with lots of people that said they were the Q user, 
10 but I doubt that. 
11 
12 
13 Q 
A Okay. And you've never had any confirmation of who this person is? 
No, sir. 
It's not me. Some people say it's me, but it's not me. It would be impossible to 
14 be me, because when they started doing it, I was under medical treatment. I was still 
15 under medical treatment when I went to see the Congress last time. 
16 Q Got it. 
17 So do you have any reason to believe that Q was a member of the U.S. 
18 Government? 
19 
20 A 
Q No, sir. 
So, just to close up this section, you're telling us here today that you've 
21 never had any direct contact with the Q user --
22 Mr. Barr. Mr .• we're having a breakup in the audio. If you could just 
23 rephrase that again. 
24 
25 - Sure. 
BY- 1 Q So I just wanted to clarify before we moved on that you are telling us here 
2 today you've never had any contact with the Q user confirmed and you don't know 
3 who the identity of that person might be. 
4 
5 
6 A 
Q 
A No, sir. 
Okay. Thank you. 
But nothing confirmed. I mean, if you look at my Gab now, there's 
7 probably four or five people that have messaged me before and said, "I'm Q," "I'm Q," 
8 "I'm Q," but I don't believe them. 
9 Q Right. 40 
10 Were you ever concerned throughout Q's posts on 8kun that they were worsening 
11 problems of violent extremism in the country? 
12 
13 A 
Q No, sir. 
And so, in exhibit 8 --we don't have to pull it back up, but, in exhibit 8, the 
14 writer talks about his education on a range of theories related to Q, including --
15 
16 
17 
18 A Can you repeat that, sir? You're breaking up. 
Mr. Barr. Yeah. Your feed is -­
- Can you hear me now? 
The Witness. I can't --I want to answer your question, but only every third word 
19 is coming through. 
20 - Can I ask the reporters if my connection's all right? 
21 
22 
23 
24 The Reporter. I can hear you. 
Okay. 
So it might be a problem on your end. 
Mr. Barr. Okay. We have a clear screen now, and I'm hearing you well. So 
25 we'll let you know if -- 1 
2 Sure. Just let me know. Thank you. 
So where was I? Okay. Ms.- could we bring back up exhibit 8? 41 
3 And after this we can take a break, because I know we've been going for about an 
4 hour. 
5 BY 
6 Q So, in this exhibit --can we zoom in? --the writer talks about his education 
7 on issues such as Pizzagate and the deep state. 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
13 Platform" --
14 
15 Q 
A Where is that? 
That is on -­
Yeah, I see that. 
So --
"I'm a regular for more than 10 years on a blog called the Burning 
Right. So it's --
--"which is a miniature version of [inaudible] research, but more like family. 
16 As unbelievable as it is, the blog still survives. I almost never tell anyone about the place 
17 because some Commie Karen would seek to shut it down, but it is the best kept secret on 
18 the internet. My education on the deep state matured there and prepared me for 
19 things like Pizzagate and eventually Q." 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Got it. So --
1 don't know what the Burning Platform is, sir. 
And what about Pizzagate and its connection to Q? 
I've heard of Pizzagate. 
So Pizzagate obviously has resulted in weapons being brought to a private 
25 business, threats of harm. Were you ever concerned about the nexus -- 1 
2 
3 
4 A 
Q 
A 
Q 42 
I had nothing to do with that, sir. 
I'm not saying you did, sir. I'm asking --
I'm not concerned about things that I don't have anything to do with, sir. 
Okay. So you were never concerned about the nexus between Q posts and 
5 public harm, real-world harm? 
6 A I don't think [inaudible] anything about harming anybody. 
7 
8 Q Okay. Thank you. That is a helpful answer. 
And just one final point on this: Did you ever consider taking action against the 
9 Q user for any posts that he or she may have put up? 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 A 
Q 
A 
Q Can you give me an example? 
So, put simply, did any posts by the Q user ever violate the U.S. Code -­
No. 
--policy? No. Okay. 
And just two more questions before we break. 
Did you see an increase in posts by Q surrounding the 2020 election? 
A Sir, there are about 5,000 Q posts, and I don't know the exact number, but 
17 they're all publicly available on my website if you would like to look for them. If you 
18 know a specific one that you're asking me about --
19 
20 
21 Q 
A 
Q I was more asking about the general trend line leading up to the election. 
I don't --I don't --1 don't have any other tracking of it. 
Okay. Thank you. 
22 And did you receive any communications from law enforcement regarding the Q 
23 posts in the timeframe of 2020? 
24 A We don't receive any communication from law enforcement regarding Q 
25 posts, sir.  1 
2 Q Okay. Thank you. 
- On that, I think we can take a break. We've been going for over an 
3 hour. So, if it's all right with you, we can go off the record at 11:10 and we can come 
4 back at 11:20. Does that work for you? 
5 Mr. Barr. That's great. 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 Sorry, 10:20 your time. 
The Witness. That's fine. We figured that out. 
All right. Thank you. 
Mr. Barr. Thank you. 
See you soon. 
[Recess.] 
- So we can go back on the record at 11:20 a.m. 
Q I had a couple followup questions on what we were just discussing, Mr. 
15 Watkins. 43 
16 The first was about your ability to remove illegal content. And I know we had an 
17 exchange about users versus accounts; obviously, there are no accounts on 8kun. 
18 So I take it there is no way to avoid someone who posts illegal content that is 
19 removed from making another account, right, or making another username and posting 
20 content there? 
21 
22 A 
Q I can ban the IP that they post from. 
Okay. So is that the --that's helpful. Is that the automatic penalty, or is 
23 there a range of penalties that you can decide? 
24 
25 A 
Q I can ban it. 
So, typically -- 44 
A It's manual. It's not automatic. 1 
2 Q Okay. So, typically, when someone posts something that is illegal, against 
3 U.S. Code, do you just remove the post or do you ban the IP address? 
4 
5 
6 A 
Q Both. 
Both. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Great. 
So I had one other followup question on the issue of QAnon that we were 
7 discussing. You mentioned a couple of times that you thought George Soros was 
8 funding that --
9 
10 
11 A You should bring him in here and depose him. 
Q So why did you think he was funding QAnon? 
A He is funding QAnon. It's --you can --you can --you can go to --I believe 
12 it's Open --Open Society I believe is the name of the company that he owns that funds it. 
13 And he funds it, and then he pays companies like The Daily Beast and Mother Jones and 
14 NBC. And if they post his paragraph in their story, they get paid. 
15 Q That's interesting. Why is that? 
16 
17 
18 A Well, because he's promulgating propaganda to get his narrative known. 
Q Okay. 
A Because he wants to take over your country and my country. He wants the 
19 United States to cease to exist. 
20 
21 
22 Q And what is the evidence for saying --what is that based on? 
A That's my opinion. 
Q Okay. Thank you for clarifying. 
23 And it was, I think, useful for us to walk through the distinction between QAnon 
24 and Q. 
25 A We did that.  45 
1 Q And that was helpful for my understanding. So thank you for doing that. 
2 I had a couple of questions --and I think Mr- may join in at some point here. 
3 Around the time of the election, did you ever have any communication with any 
4 individuals associated with the Trump campaign? 
5 
6 
7 A 
Q 
A No, sir. 
Okay. How about Roger Stone? 
I've never had a personal communication with Roger Stone. He made a 
8 video that had my name in it one time, but I had nothing to do with making that. 
9 think --
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Okay. 
--someone paid him to do that. 
And what about Michael Flynn? 
No, I've never communicated with him. 
Okay. 
And I wanted to ask about the departure of your son, Ron. He left 8kun as a --he 
16 left his role as an administrator of 8kun shortly after the election, correct? 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A I believe in December of last year. 
Okay. 2020? So 2 years ago? 
Maybe the year before last. It may be 2 years ago. 
Sure. 
Time flies. 
Especia I ly --
1 work 7 days a week, so --
Did Ron have any involvement in 8kun after he left in late 2020? 
No, sir.  1 Q Did you ever speak to your son about any communications he had with the 
2 Trump campaign? 
3 
4 A No, sir. 
Q Okay. How about the Trump campaign's legal team, in the aftermath of 
5 the election? 
A I think you'd probably have to ask Ron about that. I don't --
Q Sure. I've explained, I'm just asking --46 
6 
7 
8 A We talk --we talk several times a week but mostly about grandchildren and 
9 things like that. 
10 Q Sure. At this point, I was just asking if you had ever spoken with him about 
11 that. So, if the answer's no, that's --
12 A Are you aware that Ron Watkins is running for Congress and he'll be there 
13 where you are shortly and you'll be able to ask him directly? 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 Q Well, Ron Watkins is also under a subpoena from the select committee --
A Is he? 
Q --so hopefully we'll be speaking --
A I didn't know that. 
Q --with him before then. 
A He didn't tell me that. So, when you depose him, then you can ask him 
20 questions then. 
21 Q Thank you. Yes. Well --but if you had not had any communications that 
22 you can recall with him about that, then we can move on. 
23 
24 
25 A Did --
Q At this point, Ms.- can we pull up exhibit 26? 
And, Mr. Watkins, I didn't mean to cut you off. Were you going to say  1 something? 
A 
Q No. No. 
Okay. 47 
2 
3 
4 So this is actually asking about some tweets that your son sent out. And these 
5 were posted after the election. And you can see, in these tweets, he is trying to tell 
6 people to come --
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A How do you -­
--to D.C. --
How do you get these tweets? His Twitter's been deleted. 
Sure. So this is from an archived site that collected tweets. 
That's nice. Because, you know, Twitter only has one point of view known. 
12 It's not mine or Ron's probably. 
13 Q So did you ever discuss with him efforts to organize cross-country caravans 
14 to come to D.C. on the 6th, as was seen in this bottom tweet here? 
15 A 
16 with that? 
17 
18 Q 
A I know that he talked about cross-country caravans. Is there a problem 
I'm asking if you ever discussed --
I'm pretty sure that's a First-Amendment-covered issue. We have the right 
19 to peacefully assemble, and we have the right to redress our grievances. That's 
20 40 percent --
21 
22 Q 
A 
23 that, sir? 
24 
25 Q 
A I was only asking if you --
That's 40 percent of the First Amendment. Do you have a problem with 
Of course I do not. I was asking if you ever -­
Then what's the question about?  1 
2 
3 Q 
A 
Q The question is whether or not you ever discussed efforts about --
1 didn't discuss that with him or have anything to do with organizing that. 
Okay. Thank you. 
4 Did you know whether he was assisting anyone in these efforts or working with 
5 anyone --
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 A 
Q As I said, I didn't discuss it with him or help him do any of that. 
Thank you. 
I think-,,ight have a question or two on this before we move on. 
Thank you,_ 
And thank you, Mr. Watkins. 
BY 
Q Just in terms of --besides discussions with your son about this, did you see 
13 posts about caravans on your website? 48 
14 A I'm not familiar. If you have them, please let me know, and we can look at 
15 them. 
16 Q Oh, no. I was just wondering if you were aware of these discussions 
17 outside of your conversations with Ron about the --
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 things. 
23 
24 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q As I said, I didn't have conversations with Ron over the caravans. 
I thought you said you remembered hearing him talk about it. 
You're showing me the tweets. I've seen these tweets. 
Okay. But you didn't have one-on-one conversations with him about these 
Correct. 
Okay. And you're saying that on 8kun you don't remember seeing posts 
25 about caravans.  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 A No, I don't recall. 
Q Okay. Did you see any posts by a user "Doctor Enoch," E-n-o-c-h? 
A I've talked to him before. I've interviewed him. 
Q Okay. And do you know his real name? 
A No. He goes by "EL Enoch LE," and that had something to do with the 
6 Hebrew alphabet. I recall he mentioned that. 
Q Thank you. Was that user a Q believer? 49 
7 
8 A He's from Michigan, and he has a big camping party every summer; he calls it 
9 MAGApalooza. And that's publicly available for you to get information on him. He'd 
10 be more than happy to talk to you, I'm sure. 
11 
12 Q I appreciate --
A And if you gave me a while, I could find the interview where I talked to him 
13 before, but I don't remember the details of my interview. That may have been on 
14 VouTube, and it might not be available anymore. 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 Q 
A I appreciate that. When was your interview with him? 
A year or two ago. 
Q Okay. So do you remember if it was before or after the 2020 election? 
A I'm not sure. 
Q Okay. Did you discuss in that interview anything about caravans coming to 
20 January 6th? 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 A We talked about caravans going to his MAGApalooza, his event. 
Q But not to Washington, D.C.? 
A Not that I know of. But would that be a problem? 
Q We're just information-gathering. We're not --
A Yeah. Because I'm pretty sure that it's legal to go to Washington, D.C.  It is certainly legal to peacefully protest and to come to Washington, D.C. 
And redress your grievances. 
That is part of the First Amendment. 
Yeah. 50

Q So did you have conversations with the "Doctor Enoch" user about caravans? 
All of my conversations with Enoch are public, sir. 
They're all on YouTube? 
You could over time look them up. I mean, they're all public. 
Okay. Did you have private conversations with him about these topics, 
10 about caravans coming to Washington, D.C.? 
11 
12 
13 
14

16 A 
Q Not that I remember. 
Okay. 
Thank you very much­
-Thank you,_ 
BY 
Q So now I wanted to go through a couple of posts. All of these are still 
17 accessible on 8kun; we just took a screenshot. And I can provide you with the URLs as 
18 we go through them. And these are posts that were posted in the run-up to 
19 January 6th, and so I wanted to ask you a few questions about that. And we can go 
20 through them one by one. 
21 So the first is exhibit 14, if we can pull that up. 
22 And I know you have --we added these more recently. So, if you need to take a 
23 minute to read it, please go ahead. 
24 
25 Mr. Barr. And were you going to send the actual URL to us? 
Yep. I'm getting to the chat.  1

8 
9 Mr. Barr. Okay. Thank you. 
- For some reason, I can't find the chat. 
So this is the URL to the first one. 
Mr. Barr. It just disappeared. It was there -­
The Witness. It was a lot of gray. 
Mr. Barr. --and it's gone now. 
Yeah, well, we're going to get a link. 
It showed up in chat, and now it's gone. 
Oh, really? 
Mr. Barr. Hold on one second here. Nope. Hold on. We're good. 
Okay. 
Mr. Barr. I think it was user error on my part. 
Okay. 51 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 Q I won't read all these posts, necessarily, but this one's pretty short. It was 
16 on December 19th. And it says, quote/unquote, "You faggots ready for January 6th? 
17 This is what you cucks have been saying you wanted and are ready for. It is just about 
18 go time. Are you gonna pussy out or fight?" 
19 A This is the first time I've seen that. 
20 
21 Q Okay. Thank you, Mr. Watkins. 
Mr. Barr. And, to note, the --oh, okay. I'm sorry. At first the link wasn't 
22 working, but it does work. 
23 - Yeah, it wasn't working at first, but then it redirects. 
24 Mr. Barr. Got it. Thank you. 
25 Yeah. And that might be the case for all of them.  1

A 
Q So this is the first time you're seeing this post, Mr. Watkins? 
Yes, sir. 
And this was posted shortly after President Trump tweeted about 
5 January 6th for the first time. In his tweet, he said, "Be there, will be wild." 
6 Do you recall an increase in posts about January 6th such as this after his tweet? 
7 A Well, you're aware that 3 million people went to Washington, D.C., on 
8 January 6th. Of course there --
9 Q Indeed. 
10 A Of course there were people posting about January 6th. 
11 Q Sure. So I'm wondering if you remembered a particular increase on 
12 December 19th and the days afterward. 
13 
14 A 
Q No, I don't. No. 
Okay. 52 
15 And, just to be clear, nothing about this post would have violated 8kun's terms of 
16 service? 
17 
18 
19 A 
Q No, nothing about it would have. 
Okay. 
If we can now bring up exhibit 15? And I'll put this one in --wait, is this the same 
20 one, Meghan? 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 Sorry. So we --
Mr. Barr. It looks like it's the same --
- Oh, this is the same --so these are in the same thread, so -­
Mr. Barr. Oh, I see. 
--we have to scroll down.  The Witness. This is a what? 
Mr. Barr. The same thread. 
- The same thread. 53 
1 
2 
3 
4 The Witness. Oh. "Go to TheDonald.win for more info on the 6th unless cucks 
5 will bend over and let the government keep assfucking them." 
6 
7 
8 Q 
A Right. So here you have one --
That's not proper grammar. And TheDonald.win is a website used. The 
9 other guy --oh, you said that. I've never been --
10 
11 
12 
13 Q 
A 
Q Yes. 
--to TheDonald.win. 
Okay. So that was one of my questions. 
And, again, there's obviously a call to remove corrupt politicians, use of the N 
14 word. And none of that would reach to the level of violations of U.S. Code that would 
15 warrant removal on 8kun? 
16 
17 
18 
19 A 
Q 
A 
Q Not that I see. No. 
Okay. 
I think "cuck" is slang for "cuckold." 
Right. I'm also focused on the post above it. And this is a post calling for 
20 the removal of N-word politicians and Chief Justice Roberts after --
21 A "The Chief Justice of SCOTUS ruled no standing on the Texas case because he 
22 was scared of nigger riots." 
23 Q Right. So there was no effort to --none of that concerns you? None of 
24 that being on 8kun is of concern? 
25 A Well, I don't feel the same way as this poster.  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Right. As the owner of 8kun, is there a --
1 mean, this is not my opinion at all on the situation. 
Right. 
Is there a legal problem with that post, sir? You're an attorney. 
I was asking you whether there was anything that you found concerning 
6 about the post being on your website. 
7 A I'm --I'm --I'm not an attorney, but I don't see anything legally wrong with 
8 that post. Morally and ethically it's gross, but it's not illegal. 
9 Q Understood. So I guess I was more asking about the possibility of 
10 coordinated calls for violence on the website you own --
11 A That's not a coordinated call for violence, obviously. The guy can't 
12 coordinate a sentence. 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 Q All right. 
So, on that note, can we pull up exhibit 16? 
And this is the same thread again. 
A I can't --that's way too small to read, sir. 
Q Well, we'll zoom in. I can --
A A little bigger? 
Q I can read it out. 
So, Mr. Watkins, what would you consider a coordinated call to violence? 
A I would have to see it to consider it, sir. 
Q Okay. But that would be deleted under a fighting words, incitement 
23 prohibition? 
24 
25 A What would be? This post? I haven't read this post yet. It's still --
Q Sorry. No. We're not up to this post yet. 54  1 
2 
3 A 
Q It's still about a tenth of an inch too small for me to read, sir. 
Sure. Well, we can get to the post in a second. 
Right now I'm asking about whether or not you'd consider --what you would 
4 consider a coordinate call to violence or incitement on the platform. Have you ever 
5 removed anything on that basis? 
6 
7 
8 A 
Q 
A On 8kun? 
Yes. 
I think that everything that I've ever seen has been when --when it's 55 
9 reported to me, then it's deleted. But I don't recall any specific posts. If you have one, 
10 please show it to me, and I'll let you know. 
11 
12 
13 Q 
A Well, so this post right here, exhibit 16, can you read it now? 
That's big enough. 
"Even with a world record high score [inaudible], you can't make a dent in the 
14 nigger population. Let's say you kill one thousand niggers before you buy it. So what? 
15 When you die and" --can you scroll? --"absolutely nothing happens for any sustained and 
16 effective campaign, you need to be organized, and you can't do that isolated. Fucking 
17 hell, even towelheads are smart enough to disappear into the mountains to organize their 
18 insurgency. You are advocating for any motivated person to either do nothing because 
19 the only meaningful action is killing and they are not going to do it. Go on a lone wolf 
20 attack in which they take out 50 browns if they are very luckily" --this is a gross post, but 
21 it's not illegal. 
22 There are three posts referring to this in here. They're probably more important 
23 to this. That is 188466, 188467, 188631. They're probably more important than this 
24 post, but --this is gross, but it's not illegal. 
25 Q So here you have -- 56 
1 A And I believe that you're getting these off of a board that's called "Politically 
2 Incorrect." It's for posting gross things on. 
3 Q Right. But here you have this conversation about a sustained and effective 
4 campaign premised on --
5 
6 
7 A And when does that campaign happen, sir? 
Q So that's what I'm asking. Would it have been --
A I don't see that. I don't see that. But look on those other three posts; 
8 they're 466, 467, and 631. And they should have more information on this. 
9 
10 Q Okay. Well, we can do that. 
A Can you scroll to those? Because they're connected with three other posts. 
11 And they're probably people saying, "Get out of here, glow nigger," or, "You are an FBI 
12 agent," or something like that. Because I see government agents posting posts like this 
13 to try to disturb people at times, or people say they're government agents. 
14 So I Q 
A They call them --they call them what's called "glow niggers." 
Q 16 Okay 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 officer. A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A I don't, but --
Why is that? What does that term mean? 
That means, like, an FBI or CIA, a government agent of some kind or an 
And why are they --
So 466 is "Oy vey, go ahead and post yet another strawman. Haha. My 
23 false dichotomy is the only thing you can do. Literally nothing else exists because I say 
24 no. LOL. You lose now, white man. Kill yourself." 
25 This is the people replying to that post. "Strawman." They think it's a --they  1 think it's a setup post by a government agent. That's what the users on --
2 
3 
4 
5 Q Got it. 
A --this board --
Q I appreciate that clarification. 
A So me, personally, I don't recall the situation, so I don't know. And I've 
6 never read that before. 57 
7 Q Uh-huh. But you were going through earlier talking about you don't know 
8 when this insurgency is going to take place, you don't know where it's going to 
9 take place --
10 
11 A 
Q I read --I read --I read what you posted on the screen. 
Right. So is that that kind of --is that kind of specificity what you would 
12 need to take down a coordinated call to violence on 8kun? 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 A That's not a coordinated call to violence, is it? 
Q To me, this does look like a coordinated call to violence, to kill --
A Well --
Q --people of color. 
A --it doesn't to me. 
What do you think? 
Mr. Barr. I'm not the witness. 
The Witness. Okay. 
BY 
Q So I was just curious, you mentioned --
A It talks about killing a thousand niggers or 50 browns and it wouldn't be of 
24 any use. It doesn't say where. It doesn't say when. It doesn't --
25 Q So -- 1 
2 
3 A 
Q 
A 
4 violence, sir. 
Q 58 
--say how. And those things --
--does that --
--things would be required for it to be a coordinated call to action or 
Okay. That is a helpful answer. 5 
6 I think at this point we can move on to the next exhibit, because I think we might 
7 get some of that specificity. So --
8 A It needs to be connected, you know? 
9 Q What used to be connected? 
10 A If you're posting on --this is the --oh, this is one of those posts, but you 
11 skipped 466. You skipped --you skipped the post previous to this --
12 Q So I thought you said you'd never seen --
13 A --the one that calls them out as a government agent or a strawman. 
14 Mr. Barr. Just to note an objection. Mr. Watkins is raising that there's 
15 contextual clues that are broader than what you've introduced,_ So, if we 
16 could have the other post, 466 --
17 The Witness. Because what normal people like me say, you've got it out of 
18 context, sir. 
19 Well, I appreciate --
20 
21 
22 
23 The Witness. You cherry-picked --
The Reporter. Please speak one at a time. 
Go ahead, Mr. Watkins. 
The Witness. I said you cherry-picked this, and you left out the important 
24 information that's in between, which is post 466. 
25 Mr. Barr. To follow up,~ould it be possible to have that post  59 
1 submitted as well as an exhibit here, so we have the contextual reference of the entire 
2 discussion? 
3 If you --you're free to send us other exhibits you'd like to be 
4 introduced. 
5 Mr. Barr. Okay. 
6 - And so, again, I just want to point out, the fact that people are 
7 debating whether or not someone is a government agent doesn't really change the 
8 content of the post, which is what I was curious about and talking about, whether or not 
9 something constitutes a coordinated call to violence. That's what we were mainly 
10 interested in. 
11 And so I take your objection, and I'm happy to look at other posts that you might 
12 send over, but that was the purpose of sharing, was to discuss --
13 
14 The Witness. Okay. Yeah, whatever. 
"Lone wolf attacks do absolutely nothing, as you pointed that out. In fact, they 
15 are counterproductive because the cattle will call for action. But then again, it actually 
16 doesn't matter. The powers that be will use any event as manner of soothing the pain 
17 as in an extension of their power. There are laws passed in Germany that even the 
18 police doesn't like. The game plan here is to pass these laws, be idiotic politicians, so 
19 they can be in action for two or more years until the Bundesver-" --whatever. 
20 "Hypothetically, if there would be lone wolf attacks, that shouldn't be against brownies or 
21 some other low level scum." 
22 Again, that's gross, but it's nothing illegal. 
23 BY 
24 
25 Q 
A Okay. So I guess I was wondering about -­
Maybe in Germany-- 60 
Q --conversations about the last post -- 1 
2 
3 A Maybe it's illegal in Germany. That's what they're talking about, Germany. 
"Tell me what your stay and fight plan is then. Explain what you want people to 
4 do. Be specific. And before you don't reply, or if you do, it is not with a specific 
5 plan" --"not with a specific" --is this the same person talking? You can tell by the ID. 
6 This is 1D1C6B. 
7 Can you go back --sir --and I'm not being mad at you or anything, but --because I 
8 didn't make these posts.

Q 
A Uh-huh. 
1D1C6B, is he the one posting before in 65 or 64? 
I'm looking now. He is. 
Okay. So --
Why does that matter? 
So this is, like, two or three people having a conversation here. 
Okay. And they're still discussing --
And down at the bottom, we've got, "Assassinating key people makes 
17 events, but the needs organization too." 
18 
19 You know, he doesn't speak in good grammar. I notice that. 
"The reason lone wolf attacks random shitskins is because they are operating in 
20 the dark. It can take a network to plan a targeted" --
21 Q --"assassination, like The Troubles." 
22 A Okay. 
23 Q So what I'm --
24 A So he's just making conjecture himself, whoever this is. 
25 Q So what I was asking here: Does the discussion of talking about  1 assassinating key people, is there any concern about --

Q You can discuss that all you want. That's not illegal, sir. 
Talking about assassination --
That's protected speech. 
If they say --
You can't do it or schedule it. 
Right. So --
When you start scheduling, that's a very serious thing. 
So, again, this is posted --
That's very serious, when you start scheduling it. 
This is posted in the context of a thread talking about January 6th. And, 
12 obviously, January 6th involved a specific date and a specific target, the joint session of 
13 Congress.

I don't know it. 
Well, I don't know it either. So let's move on. 
Well, I'm asking --
You're asking for my opinion. 
Your opinion as the owner of the site --
1 have given you my opinion on this, and my opinion won't change. 
Okay. If they had named a specific person, would that have been a 
Give me the date and time. 
Okay. 23 
24 
25 At this point, , we can go on to exhibit 18. 61  62 
Just a couple more of these. 
This is a different person, 261F9CB. 1 
2 
3 A 
Q So we don't have to read this whole one out loud, but the one sentence I am 
4 interested in: "We have to seize this moment to make sure" --
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 A 
Q I have to read it, though. 
All right. 
Mr. Barr. I think we'd like to get the full context of this 
Sure. 
The Witness. "Dr. Pierce" --can you scroll? "Dr. Pierce described and what 
10 James Mason wrote about" --I don't know Dr. Pierce or James Mason. 
11 
12 Q So I believe that's a reference to the work, the "Siege." I don't know if 
13 you're familiar with that? 
A 14 No, 
15 
16 
17 to you. Q 
A 
Q Okay. Well --
And please understand- don't use these words that I'm repeating 
I do understand that, yes. 
A 19 It's not my --
Q 1 think it's helpful to read some of them out loud. 
21 So James Mason was involved in the nee-Nazi movement in this country, and he 
22 wrote the book "Siege," which is sort of an accelerationist, White supremacist book. 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q I haven't read it. 
That does make two of us. 
And I guess the reason I was including this post in our discussion was really the  63 
1 second sentence, about "we have to seize this moment," "to make sure they get scooped 
2 up," "standing up for our rights first and foremost." 
3 Again, this seems like a coalescing of conversation around January 6th. But I 
4 take it, based on our prior exchanges on prior exhibits, none of this would be specific 
5 enough in terms of violence or --
6 A This refers to three other posts, this post. It refers to 188427, 188433, 
7 188446. That's what those things in red are on the left. And it's in red; that means 
8 you've seen it before. 
9 
10 
11 Q 
A 
Q Uh-huh. 
So I don't know what those are, though. I don't know those posts. 
I don't have those up right now. I'm really asking more about this post in 
12 particular and the one post saying "we have to seize this moment and stand up" in 
13 reference to January 6th. 
14 
15 A That's not what it says. 
Mr. Barr. I do want to correct for the record, it says "to size this moment," 
16 which, of course, could mean to appraise or to evaluate. 
17 The Witness. And it says "to make sure they get scooped up by a controlled 
18 opposition." It doesn't say the words you said, sir. 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 B~ 
Q Okay. We can move on. 
And I think we have one more exhibit we want to talk about, and it's exhibit 19. 
So I don't know if you want to read this post to yourself or out loud --
A I want to read it. I'm not familiar with any of these. 
This is also referring to 188464. That other one was as well. Is that the original 
25 one that we started with?  1 
2 Q 
A Um --
"The plan is to elucidate the public of the nigger mentality and aggression 
3 rates, then segregate. Alternatively, we revive eugenics and isolate who are previous 
4 foes to intense aggression such as burning, looting, and murder. If you're suicidal, the 
5 best way to go is by protecting innocents against hordes of inbred niggers. You kill the 
6 violent ones and become a martyr." 
7 That's a weird post, but it's not illegal. 
8 I have some opinions on segregation, but they probably don't belong here. 
9 
10 
11 Q 
A 
Q Yeah, I'm really just asking about --
Is that what you're asking me about, segregation? 
No. I'm asking you about the call to kill people of color if you are suicidal 
12 and whether or not that's --
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Does it say "people of color" in there? 
What? It does not say "people of color." It says --
"If you're suicidal, the best way is" --it doesn't say what you just said, sir. 
It says --
It says, "If you're suicidal, the best way to go is by protecting innocents 
18 against hordes of inbred niggers." 
19 
20 Q 
A 
21 anywhere. Right. So --
So, when there are hordes of inbred niggers --which I doubt you'll find 
I'm not really interested in debating --64 
22 
23 Q 
A Think about --think about --think about what this person is saying. You're 
24 not going to find that situation anywhere. It's pretty much an impossible situation.

To me, this seems like a pretty clear -­

--it doesn't say what you said. 
--mentally disturbed people to kill people of color. And I'm wondering if 
7 that's concerning to you. 65 
8 A But that's not what it says, sir. That's not what it says. And I didn't make 
9 this post either. 
10

Okay. Unless anyone else has anything on this --

I'm not going to speculate --
1 mean, inbreeding is illegal in America in every State, in most countries on 
I don't really have an interest in --
Yeah, I'm certain. I'm certain. It's called incest. 
Right. But, regardless, this is calling for the slaughter of people --
It's calling for protecting innocents from hordes of incestuous niggers. That 
24 would be the word "inbred."

So, again, no problem there, based on that reading? 
It's gross. I have a problem with it. I don't like people like that. 
But in terms of as the owner of 8kun, no problem with that? 
It's not illegal. They're having a conversation. 
This may or may not be the same person that posted 8464. I'm not certain. 
Q 
A Okay. 
It looks like they're responding to 464. But they're having a conversation, 66 
11 and it's going nowhere, but --next they'll talk about the Nazis again. You know, they're 
12 just --

--drunk idiots probably. 
Conversation aside, these individual posts are -­
This is likely a conversation by drunk idiots, sir. 
Granted. 
18 So we can take this exhibit down, Ms.-
19 And I just wanted to ask whether or not there were any instances that you can 
20 recall in the run-up to January 6th where you did remove content because it was inciting 
21 violence or fighting words or true threats that were not allowed under the --
22 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A 
Q I don't recall any, sir. But if they are, there would be a record. 
Okay. Would it be possible to provide a record to us in a --
As I said, that's a public record. It's at bans.html. 
Okay. And that would include the posts as well as the usernames and -- 67 
1 A It shows what was deleted. If there was an image involved, the image 
2 won't be there. 
3 
4 
5 Q Okay. Okay. 
And there were no other proactive sweeps of --
A We don't sweep any --that we sweep? You know --you know, I don't have 
6 any money. I lose money in this operation, sir. It's basically there to help keep 
7 America free. 
8 
9 Q 
A Why do you think America needs to be kept free? 
Because it's being taken away from us rapidly. Think about the last 2 years, 
10 how many portions of the First Amendment were taken away from us over the last 
11 2 years illegally. 
12

18 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Through what kind of activity? 
Through mandates. 
So this is chiefly about COVID restrictions? 
Well, I think that they were used as an excuse to help take over our country. 
Okay. 
That's my opinion. I don't have --
Yes, yes. No, I'm interested. And, again, this is important context, and I 
19 want to make sure we get the context. 
20 So how does 8kun fit into that resistance --
21 A 8kun gives people the place where they can discuss things freely without 
22 being turned off, like people like Twitter or YouTube or Facebook do. They don't allow 
23 people to speak freely. 
24 
25 Q 
A And is that why you feel it's important to keep the, sort of, bare minimum -­
It's important because it's for our country. Our country needs a place  68 
1 where people can gather. Because you took --you didn't personally, but the people you 
2 work for --took gathering together and peacefully protesting and the right to redress our 
3 grievances away from us. They did that with a great big fence and basically two 
4 divisions of National Guard. 
5 Think about it. You're aware that they had 20,000 National Guard members and 
6 a giant fence to keep people out of protesting --
7 
8 Q 
A I'm aware of that after the attack, yes. Yes. 
Yeah. You know, that's illegal in itself. That's, like, gross offense to the 
9 United States of America. It's like, "Guess what? Our country's over." That's what 
10 that fence was. 
11 Q Why do you think that? 
12 A Well, because you can no longer peacefully assemble or redress your 
13 grievances. How would those people know? 
14 Q Did you think that --
15 A You know, it's the American way to go there to Washington, D.C., to get your 
16 voice heard. 
17 Think back to the '70s. We had the tractor --the tractor guys went there, and 
18 they stopped government. They were more practical and better at stopping 
19 government than anybody since then, the tractor people. Some of those older 
20 Congressmen might even remember that. They were still there. 
21 They had to actually lie to those farmers to get them to go home. They 
22 out-and-out lied to them, sent them home, and then did what the farmers were 
23 protesting against anyway. They told the farmers, you win, go home, and then they 
24 went home, and then they messed them over anyway. 
25 Q So -- 1 
2 
3 A 
Q 
A You've taken that ability away from --not you personally, but -­
Did you not think that the fence was necessary --
--the Congressmen have taken that away. And that's 40 --40 --40 --40 
4 percent of the First Amendment, which is the first one in the Bill of Rights. 
5 Q Do you not think the fence was necessary to protect Congress and the 
6 government after the attack? 
7 A I was in Washington, D.C., on January 6th. There were 3 million people 
8 there. There were plenty of police there. There was lots of friendly banter going on 
9 and all of that. There was no litter on the ground. Were you there, sir? Those 
10 people were friendly. They were beautiful, wonderful. 69 
11 It was 1 percent of --approximately 1 percent of the United States of America was 
12 in Washington, D.C., that day. That's unprecedented. It's never been done before. 
13 That's more people than Martin Luther King, Jr., had in August 1963 on his march on 
14 Washington. 
15 Q So do you believe what happened that day --
16 
17 
18 A 
Q 
A Do you realize that? 
I realize that. 
Now, I do know that crimes happened that day. I do know there were 
19 troublemakers and ruffians and what have you. It happens. But 3 million people, and 
20 the amount of people they arrested, you would have to put logarithmic progression into a 
21 graph to even see that number. Otherwise, they would be statistically invisible. 
22 
23 Q 
A So --
That was a peaceful American protest. I know, for example, San Francisco 
24 has about 1,000 people in jail any given day, and they have less than a million people in 
25 San Francisco. We had 3 million people there that day, a full cross-section of America,  70 
1 and they had less crime than a smaller city has on any daily basis. It was a peaceful day, 
2 sir. 
3 Q Mr. Watkins, I appreciate all of that, and I agree that you think that it was 3 
4 million people. I understand that. 
5 I want to ask you if you think that January 6th was a peaceful protest. Do you 
6 think the events of that day was a peaceful protest? 
7 A Well, I went to a rally, and that rally --we marched over to the Capitol after 
8 the rally, and it was very peaceful. I saw some people on the steps of a couple buildings; 
9 they were, like, causing trouble, what have you. I think it was the Supreme Court 
10 maybe. They had --but they were beating drums or having bullhorns or whatever. 
11 That's normal. That's --
12 
13 
14 
15 Q 
A 
Q 
A Did you see people breaking into the Capitol? 
Excuse me, sir? 
Did you see people breaking into the Capitol? 
No, sir. That --I've seen the videos of it later. That was on the other side 
16 of the Capitol from the 3 million people. The 3 million people marched from the rally 
17 over to Washington's Capitol. And the people that broke in were, like, people that went 
18 in through the backdoor, where the servants and security guards enter. 
19 Can 1--sorry,_ I wasjust--
20 -Go ahead,_ 
21 B 
22 Q Mr. Watkins, you said you've seen videos since then. So have you seen 
23 videos of violence in Washington, D.C., on January 6th? 
24 
25 A 
Q I've seen the videos that are on the news, sir. 
Okay. And would you agree that in some of those videos there is violence  71 
1 taking place against law enforcement officials in and around the Capitol on January 6th? 
2 
3 A 
Q Can you cite a specific video? 
I don't have the specific video on me, but I'll represent to you that there are 
4 lots of videos, public source, some of them from people's own Parler accounts that day, 
5 where you can see violence occurring against --
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A "Par-lay." 
--law enforcement officials on --
"Par-lay." 
--January 6th. Have you seen --
But as I said, it's a negligible amount of people. I think you guys arrested 
11 approximately 650 people out of 3 million. 
12 
13 
14 Q 
A Well, again, that is your view of how many -­
That's --that's --that's statistically invisible. 
Now, where I was, it was impossible to even get close to the Capitol because there 
15 were so many people. It was a sea of humanity. And we were all friendly. There was 
16 no litter on the ground. That was the most thing that --that I noticed. 
17 
18 Q 
A You were on the --
There was no litter on the ground. And I've been to Washington, D.C. On 
19 any given day, it's filthy. But that day it was clean. Those people were there for a 
20 peaceful purpose, and they didn't want it to be offended by anything --
21 
22 
23 Q 
A What was that purpose? 
To redress their grievances, sir. 
24 There were a lot of different people there. I saw the people there that were 
25 supporting --the Taiwanese flag people were there. And I saw people there from  72 
1 different biogs that I've talked to before. It was a --it was a great --I was there because 
2 I believed that the election was stolen. 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Why did you believe the election was stolen? 
Haven't you seen the glitch, sir? 
No. Please explain. 
Have you seen "2000 Mules"? 
I have not seen the whole thing. 
That's a good movie, I've heard. I haven't seen it either, but I got the 
9 summary of it, that they proved that people like Stacey Abrams, the person that was 
10 running for Governor, I believe, in Georgia, had coordinated it out of her office, is what I 
11 had heard the movie talks about. 
12 And I also saw that the sheriff in Yuma, Arizona, was able to make arrests of 
13 people that were committing election fraud --and not voter fraud, but actual election 
14 fraud, and the sheriff was able to arrest them. And they have already pied guilty to it. 
15 So, yeah, the election was stolen, and it's been proven. Now, it hasn't been 
16 proven in a court of law, because the court of laws have refused to hear it. So, you 
17 know, then it just becomes an opinion issue --
18 
19 Q 
A So were there particular --
--and you know my opinion. And you know what? Opinions in America 
20 are like sphincters; everyone has one. 
21 Q So were there particular areas in the country where you thought there was 
22 voter fraud occurring? 
23 A Well, how about Maricopa County, Arizona? How about Philadelphia, 
24 Pennsylvania? 
25 Q And why do you think there?  73 
1 A Well, I saw where they were --I saw the video of them covering the windows 
2 and refusing to let poll watchers watch the counting. 
3 I saw videos --and maybe this was Georgia, but it may not have been --where 
4 they pulled out suitcases full of ballots from under desks and counted them after the 
5 election watchers were dismissed, and there was videotape of that. 
Q That --that is helpful context. 
7 Yeah A 
11 
12 to this. Q 
A 
Q 
A Who do you think was responsible for all of this? 
You and me both want to know that,_ 
That's part of what we're trying to figure out, are all the first steps leading up 
I want to know that as well. But, in the meantime, I will fully stand that 
13 that election was fraudulent and needs to be redone. 
14 Q So, actually, on that point --well- before I move on, do you have 
15 anything else on this? 
17 what? Actually, about the suitcases --
18 The Witness. I don't know anything specific on those suitcases other than a 
19 video I saw. I wasn't there. 
20 I understand that, Mr. Watkins. I was actually going to ask if you 
21 had heard that the Republican secretary of state and other Republican officials in Georgia 
22 investigated that, as well as the Department of Justice, investigated those claims about 
23 suitcases full of ballots and found them to be completely invalid. Had you heard that 
24 news? 
25 The Witness. Missed it.  1 
2 
3 Thank you. 
Q So I wanted to back up a little bit and ask about your decision to travel to 
4 D.C. When did you first decide to go to D.C. for January 6th? 
5 A When the President of the United States announced that he was going to 
6 have a rally. Then I bought a ticket and went. 
7 Q Why did you think it was important to be there, when the President 
8 announced it? 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 A Well, don't you think it's good to support the President of our country? 
Q I think that --
A Yeah. 
Q --you should --
A Pretty much, that's what you're supposed to do if you're an American. 
14 That's --you're supposed to support your President. 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 Q And why was going to the rally --
A And he was still the President on January 6th, wasn't he? 
Q He was. 
A Yes, he was. 
Q Undoubtedly. 
A That's why --
Q So I'm wondering why going to the rally was a way of showing support. 
A Why wouldn't I? I've been to another rally of his too. I went to another 
23 one of his in Arizona. He's an excellent speaker. He's motivational. 74 
24 Q So you're saying you first heard about the rally when he tweeted about it on 
25 December 19th?  1 
2 
3 A 
Q Well, I don't know the specific date, but, yes, sir. 
Okay. 
And what about posts by Q? Were there any references there to January 6th 
4 that made you want to attend? 75 
5 A Not that I know of. I think the last Q post was a link to a Dee Snider music 
6 video. 
7 Q Okay. So nothing that you can remember. 
8 And so, saying that you were going to January 6th to support the President, what 
9 were your expectations --
10 A Dee Snider's been to Congress before as well. He went to help support the 
11 First Amendment. 
12 Q So, on that note --
13 A Him and Frank Zappa and John Denver. He's the last living one of those 
14 folks that went there to help support the First Amendment. That was the Senate, 
15 though, not the --the varsity, so to speak, in the Congress. 
16 Q So, on that note about supporting the First Amendment, what were your 
17 hopes for January 6th and President Trump's call to have you come? What was going to 
18 happen? 
19 
20 
21 day? 
22 A 
Q 
A Well, I went there to hear what he had to say. 
Did you have any expectation that there would be things happening that 
No. But here's why you need to go there in person. I can explain why. 
23 Because the news media won't tell you what he has to say unless you show up to actually 
24 hear it. 
25 I remember, that evening, watching the TV news in the lobby of my hotel --no, it  76 
1 wasn't the lobby of the hotel; it was the lobby of the restaurant next door to the hotel. 
2 It was a Cuban restaurant. It was really good food. The President was talking. They 
3 were silent; you could just see his lips moving. And then they were paraphrasing what 
4 he said, which was nothing to do with what he actually said. They were basically putting 
5 words in the mouth of the President of the United States. 
6 So people that weren't there never had the opportunity to hear what he had to 
7 say. And that is despicable. 
8 Q So I know- has a few questions on this as well, but I wanted to ask 
9 about when you saw the tweet. So that tweet says --
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 A I don't remember the exact date, sir. 
Q Okay. You don't remember him saying, "Be there, will be wild"? 
A I don't remember the exact context of the post. 
Q Okay. 
Well, - if you want to jump in here. 
Sure. 
Thank you, Mr. Watkins. 
BY 
Q So you do remember the idea of a post where President Trump asked people 
19 to come to Washington, D.C., correct? 
20 
21 A 
Q Yes, sir. I went. 
No, I understand. I'm just setting up the context here. 
22 Do you --on 8kun, after that post, were a lot of people also expressing that they 
23 had felt called to Washington, D.C., by the President? 
24 
25 A Literally, the President did call people to Washington, D.C. 
Q So did people -- 77 
1 A That's what his post said, wasn't it? Can you read the post to me? He 
2 literally called people to go to Washington, D.C., and I went. 
3 Q Correct. I'm asking if you saw other people on 8kun post similarly, agreeing 
4 with your view of President Trump's tweet? 
5 
6 A I think that thousands and thousands of people probably did. 
Q Okay. And do you have any general recollection --not asking you to 
7 remember a specific one --about what they were saying, you know, just, like, as a general 
8 matter? 
9 
10 
11 D.C.? 
12 A 
Q 
A No, not particularly. No. 
But they were saying that President Trump had called them to Washington, 
He literally called us to Washington, D.C., and it was something about a wild 
13 party or whatever. I don't remember the exact words of it. Probably that tweet is not 
14 available anymore either. 
15 
16 Q Were people saying they had been waiting for this call? 
A Not that I remember.  78 
1 
2 [12:13 p.m.] 
3 BY 
Q Okay. Did they seem excited that this call had finally come? 
A Not that I remember. 4 
5 
6 Q Okay. And so your own view about the tweet, did --I know it clearly stays 
7 on your mind because you went to Washington, D.C. 
8 
9 A 
Q I did. 
Right. Do you remember other times when President Trump asked his 
10 supporters to show up anywhere? 
11 A I have showed up in other places. I remember him asking people to go in 
12 Phoenix and I went to --it was not Phoenix, It was outside of Phoenix, in Gila County I 
13 believe, or Gila County I'm pretty sure. 
14 
15 
16 
17 Q Do you know how to spell that? I'm sorry. 
A G-i-1-a. It's a suburb of Phoenix. 
Q 
A Understood. 
And I don't really recall the exact city name. But it was like a racetrack. 
18 was in Rolling Stone magazine that day, so that would be something we could find out the 
19 exact date. I don't recall the date. I remember the official announcement that there 
20 were 55,000 people there, and Rolling Stone printed 15,000, and I thought that was, like, 
21 just showing how slanted they are. 
22 Q Okay. And in terms of the 8kun site, do you remember if any people 
23 created, like, whole --sorry --created message boards specifically dedicated to 
24 responding to President Trump's December 19th tweet? 
25 A Not that I can recall.  1 Q Were there message boards talking about heading to Washington, D.C., on 
2 January 6th? 
3 A Probably. I think probably on Twitter or on maybe Discord or on all of 
4 these other things. Easier to organize things on than 8kun. 8kun is an anonymous 
5 image board. It's hard to organize anything. It's like herding cats, sir. 
6 Q Do you know or remember if people were posting any specific images 
7 related to Washington, D.C.? 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 A No, I can't remember specific images, sir. 
I was just making sure. 
- we can go back to you. 
- Thankyou,_ BY-
Q On that point, do you remember any discussion on 8kun about the joint 
14 session of Congress being the reason for President Trump's call to D.C.? 
15 
16 A 
Q That's way more detailed than I can recall, sir. 
Did you think that there was a chance that day that there would be a delay 
17 in the certification of the electoral votes? 79 
18 A Well, I certainly could have hoped for that because I personally believe that 
19 the Constitution is silent on this issue and that Mike Pence committed a cowardly act by 
20 not putting it aside and thinking about it and giving everybody more time to put it 
21 together. 
22 But those are my personal opinions on the event. Of course it's way over my 
23 ability to have anything to do with. I'm just a private citizen, sir. I'm actually shocked 
24 that you guys could even care about what I have to say because I am so far removed from 
25 Congress. The closest I am is that my son's going to be there next January. And that's  80 
1 exciting to me. I'm very proud of it. 
2 
3 
4 Q I'm glad you're proud of him. 
On 8kun, did you see conversations about Vice President's Pence's --
A I wrote --I have --actually not on 8kun, but on my personal blog, 
5 SeriousJim.com, I wrote comments on this. I can read those comments to you exactly 
6 on what we're talking about right now. Hold on. 
7 I did --that was --that was --duh, duh, duh, duh, duh --I haven't updated this 
8 since then. But I have actually on this exact issue, I have written it --on January 10th, I 
9 wrote about it --oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's the wrong day. 
10 Here we are. December 28th I wrote about it. "Who's at the Helm of Our 
11 Nation?" is the title. 
12 "Mike Pence, the 48th Vice President of the United States of America. There is a 
13 lot of air to clear, with all the misinformation that has been spewed over the last 
14 election cycle. But Mike Pence has been a star over the past year. Doing what is 
15 necessary, going past that which was required of him. Taking over the Coronavirus Task 
16 Force has shown what a resourceful and vital man he is for America and the Americans. 
17 "Unlike most vice presidents, Pence has stood up and been in leadership positions 
18 through his first four years as VP. He has been an effective and trustworthy right 
19 hand" --lah-dee-dah-dee everybody. 
20 
21 And we get down here to the meat of it. Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh. 
Okay. Here we are. "He provided Indiana rock solid leadership as a governor. 
22 He lowered Indiana's tax burden. He fought like a true patriot for constituents. We 
23 are lucky. He is the closing pitcher that can bring victory back to America. He is the 
24 one that needs our prayers at this time. He's the one that needs to know the will of the 
25 nation is behind him as he navigates our great ship into the harbor."  81 
1 Q So did you believe that President Trump was calling people to D.C. to 
2 encourage Vice President Pence to delay the certification? 
3 A No, that's not what I said at all. But I have --my thoughts on this issue are 
4 public, and I'm going to give that to my attorney and he can issue that. These are my 
5 thoughts on the current issue. I expressed them in writing at the time. 
6 
7 Q 
A Sure. Okay. Thank you. 
And I don't recall writing this, but I will send it to my attorney right now and 
8 you can put it into the record. 
9 
10 
11 Q 
A 
Q And just two more questions on Vice President Pence. 
It may be a thousand words, so I don't want to read it all. 
Thank you. 
12 And two more questions on Vice President Pence, then we're going to move into 
13 some of your activities --
14 
15 A 
Q This is the only time I've ever talked about Vice President Pence. 
Sure. This is about whether or not you remember on 8kun there being 
16 posts that were removed because of threats against Vice President Pence. 
17 
18 
19 
20 A 
Q 
A 
Q If there was ever a threat against him, I'm sure it was removed. 
Do you recall any of that on the website? 
No. I never removed it, but, you know, maybe somebody else did. 
Okay. All right. So I do now want to talk more about your movements in 
21 D.C. on January 5th and 6th, but I think it might be --
22 
23 A 
Q I can talk about where I went that day. 
Great. So I think it might be a good time, do you want to take another 
24 break? We've been going for about an hour, so we can take another 10-minute break. 
25 A Let's keep going.  1 
2 Q 
A Let's keep going. All right. Cool. We'll keep going. 
Because I don't actually have a lot of real information that's important to 
3 you. Everything I have is just opinion. But I can tell you where I went that day. 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 Q So you arrived on January 5th, correct? 
A I arrived on January 5th. 
Q Sure. 
A I stayed in the Hamilton Hotel. 
Q Okay. 
A Actually just next to The Washington Post. 
Q And what was the mood like at the hotel? Did you see anyone there? 
A There were people outside partying in the streets. They were having a 
12 great time. 82 
13 Q And did you hear people talking about what they thought would happen the 
14 next day? 
15 A They were --when I got there it was in the evening, and there were drunks, 
16 and everyone was drunk and partying and even out onto the street. 
17 
18 
19 
20 Q Were you concerned about violence when you got to the city? 
A No, It was very friendly. 
Q Did you see any violence that night? 
A No, sir. I was at the Hamilton Hotel, and I ventured out and walked in front 
21 of The Washington Post, took some pictures, and then went back to my hotel. That's all 
22 I did that evening. 
23 Q Great. And so on the night of January 5th, your son Ron tweeted that he 
24 was going to be dropping the mother of all bombs the next day. And 
25 there's documentary -- 1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 A Is that what he said? Can you show me that tweet? 
Q I don't have it up right now. 
A I think that you're paraphrasing. 
Q I may be paraphrasing, but he basically intimated that he was --
A But I don't recall the tweet. 
Q --that he was going to be making a drop of --I believe he did write MOAB, 
7 mother of all bombs. 
8 
9 
10 
11 A I don't --I want to see that. 
Q We can touch base with your attorney to provide you the actual tweet. 
A I don't recall that. I want to see that. 
Q Okay. So there's HBO documentary footage of you receiving a phone 
12 call from --
13 
14 
15 A You realize that's Hollywood, sir? 
Q Well, I'm asking you about what actually happened. 
A The HBO documentary makes it look like I'm leading the revolution or 
16 something. 83 
17 Q Well, sir, I'm going to ask you what actually happened through some of these 
18 clips. 
19 So there is footage in that documentary of you receiving a phone call from Ron at 
20 the Hamilton Hotel, and in that phone call he's talking about how no one knows what he's 
21 going to be dropping. 
22 Do you remember that phone call with Ron? 
23 
24 A No, I don't. 
Q You don't? Do you remember talking to him at all about what the drop was 
25 going to involve?  84 
1 A I don't recall it. If you have a video of it, you could show it and refresh my 
2 memory. 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Sir, I don't have the video up right now. 
I've seen the documentary one time. I participated in it. 
So --
If you have questions on that documentary, we could go over it. 
Well, I have some questions about some of the footage in the documentary, 
8 and so we can talk through it now. 
9 So in that clip Ron says over the phone that he's going to make a claim that will 
10 shatter some institutions. 
11 Do you remember him saying that? 
12 
13 A 
Q No. 
Okay. And had you had any discussion of things he was going to drop on 
14 January 6th? 
15 A No, sir. And I think you need to realize that that clip --the clips in that 
16 video are all pieced together. And I did notice that a lot of things happened from 
17 sometimes years before, because that documentary went over several years. 
18 And the documentarian, I believe his name is Cullen Hoback. You should talk 
19 with him. He has a lot of information. He could probably answer more of these 
20 questions that you're asking me about Q and QAnon than anybody. He's the most 
21 knowledgeable person on the subject probably on Earth. 
22 Mr. Barr. And just to lodge an objection,_I think it would be helpful to 
23 refresh Mr. Watkins to actually have either a transcript of what you're referring to or the 
24 actual video so that he would be able to attest to whether he spoke those words or 
25 whether they were edited into some fashion by the producer. He's unable to answer  85 
1 questions. 
2 - Unfortunately, we don't have the clips ready to play right now. But 
3 I'll ask the questions and if you don't recall, then that's totally fine. 
4 The Witness. 
5 BY 
6 Q And if there are any things we can pull up as we go, then we could certainly 
7 do that. 
8 
9 
10 A Okay. 
Q So for now --but thank you for your cooperation. 
A I'm cooperating, don't get me wrong. I just don't --I don't recall this, 
11 because that documentary is all pieced together, and it's pieced together in an interesting 
12 timeline. 
13 Q Got it. So I'll just note it. 
14 Now I'd like to pull up exhibit 27. 
15 
16 
17 A 
Q Excuse me? 
I'm just speaking to one of my colleagues about pulling up exhibit 27. 
So this is actually the blog post. It's a screenshot from Ron's blog post the next 
18 morning. So this is --
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 A 
Q 
A This is Ron's blog? What's the name of his blog? What's the URL? 
I can get you the URL. I don't have it handy right now. 
That's important. 
Q Sure. We can get that for you. 
So this is the drop that he was referring to in your conversation the night before. 
24 And you can see here that it's focused on Vice President Pence. And he ends by saying, 
25 "I hereby call for the immediate arrest of Michael Richard Pence, 48th Vice President of  1 the United States, for treason." 
2 And then, "Patriots --You are all in D.C. today for a reason." 
3 Do you remember reading this quote? 
4 A I don't remember this, but I do agree with Michael Pence probably did 
5 commit treason. 
6 Q Why do you think that? 
7 A Well, he allowed the fraudulent election to go through, whereas he could 
8 have stopped it there as President of the Senate. And look what that's done. Look 
9 how many people have died because of that. 
10 
11 Q What do you mean? 
A What do I mean? Look at all the people that died when we abandoned 
12 Afghanistan. Look at --and you know what happened in Afghanistan. As soon as we 86 
13 abandoned it, $80 billion worth of weaponry is unaccounted for now. And all of that --
14 
15 
16 Q So with due respect --
A --there in Afghanistan is now --
Q I'm going to interrupt you now, because we don't need to talk about 
17 Afghanistan now. 
18 A Well, that's probably my opinion on this, because I have opinions on this. 
19 didn't write this. 
20 
21 Q That makes sense. I was asking your thoughts on it. 
A Well, I'm agreeing with that Mike Pence probably committed treason, and 
22 you asked for my opinion on it, and then I was telling you why. 
23 
24 
25 Q Understood. 
So did you ever discuss the underlying allegations of this post with Ron? 
A No, sir.  87 
1 Q Okay. In the documentary --and understand we don't have the clips to 
2 play --you're saying --you're quoted as saying in the morning that you have thousands of 
3 pages of evidence, video, audio, documents showing that Mike Pence is a traitor. 
4 Did you ever see any of that evidence? 
5 A I don't recall saying that. But if I said it, I said it. But, you know, it's 
6 Hollywood, sir. 
7 Mr. Barr. Again, we just ask -- 1 
2 
3 
4 
5 Q 
A 
Q B~ 
Regardless, did you ever --
It wasn't an actual legitimate documentary. 
Regardless, did you ever see evidence, underlying evidence, showing that 
6 Vice President Pence was a traitor? 
7 
8 A 
Q Other than what I feel, I don't recall, sir. 
Okay. That was what I wanted to ask. 
9 So the morning of January 6th, can you walk us through what your movements 
10 were in the morning, before you got to the rally? 
11 
12 
13 
14 A 
Q 
A 
Q Well, the rally was in the morning, sir. 
Right. But until then, what did you do in the morning? 
I walked down to the Washington Monument. 
Okay. When you were at the Washington Monument, did you see any 
15 Proud Boys there? 
No, sir. 88 
16 
17 A 
Q Okay. And then after the Washington Monument, did you proceed to the 
18 rally? 
19 A The rally was at the Washington --it was all the way from the --where 
20 President Trump was speaking to the Washington Monument was packed with people. 
21 That's a huge amount of people. And I was at the Washington Monument and at the tail 
22 end of it. You couldn't even see the President except up on the screen. 
23 Q What was the mood like? 
24 A It was wonderful. It was peaceful. It was patriotic. It was --that was a 
25 cross-section of America. I have never seen so many people in one place at one time for  89 
1 the same reason. It was great. 
Q Understood. 
So you watched President Trump's speech, correct? 
A I did, on the prompter. It was up on the prompter video. 2 
3 
4 
5 Q Was it your impression that President Trump was telling individuals to march 
6 to the Capitol during the speech? 
7 A At the end of it, he did say that. He said, let's peacefully march over there 
8 and let them know how we feel, something like that. 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 Q What was your reaction when he said that? 
A I'm paraphrasing now. 
Q Yeah. What was your reaction when he said that? 
A 
Q 
A I walked over there with everybody else. 
Did you think President Trump was going to go with you? 
No, of course not. 
Q Okay. So I will note that in the documentary --
A I don't think the Secret Service would have allowed him to do that. 
Q Okay. I will note that in the documentary you said he said he's going to 
18 lead us. 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 A You understand that documentary is pieced together, sir. 
Q Understood. 
So you started marching to the Capitol after the speech ended? Is that correct? 
A Yes, sir. 
Q And what did you think was going to happen when you marched to the 
24 Capitol? 
25 A Just a rally, a peaceful rally, and everyone is going to be probably singing  90 
1 "We shall overcome," like they did during Martin Luther, Jr.'s March on Washington. 
2 Q I guess one question on the quote in the documentary. Do you recall what 
3 you meant when you said he is going --he was going to lead us? If that's taken out of 
4 context --
5 
6 
7 A 
Q 
A I don't recall saying that. 
Okay. 
I'm not saying I didn't say it. But you know what? I talk all day long, so I 
8 can't remember everything I say. 
9 Q So it was your impression that folks were going to be rallying peacefully and 
10 singing "We shall overcome." What was your impression of the scene when you got to 
11 the Capitol? Was it consistent with those expectations? 
12 A Well, when I got there it was peaceful. Wow, really peaceful. There were 
13 some idiot teenagers hanging off scaffolding, things like that, and I was thinking you've 
14 got to get down because it's dangerous. You know, this is what I'm thinking. 
15 There were people there, a few people instigating with megaphones. I recall 
16 seeing antifa people there, and they connected arms, maybe --like a military squad 
17 perhaps. Maybe six to nine people connected arms going through traffic with umbrellas 
18 up, using them to push people out of the way, that said antifa underneath them. And 
19 you know what? That Cullen Hoback that I mentioned would have video of that if you 
20 were to contact him. 
21 
22 Q 
A Thank you. 
He would be able to identify those antifa members by that video because 
23 they didn't have their faces covered at the time. But their umbrellas all said antifa, and 
24 they were all armed, linked together, pushing their way through the crowd with 
25 umbrellas. I recall that.  1 And then in front of them was a man with a, like, I'm graduating college beanie 
2 and a propeller on top of it and a megaphone saying, "Fight, start a fight, start a fight," 
3 things like that, and that would also be on Cullen Hoback's video camera. 
4 My batteries were already dead by then. I was taking video of that day too. 
5 Most of the day I documented on [inaudible] dot-com. 
6 BY 
7 Q So, Mr. Watkins, in terms of just trying to set up a time and location, you 
8 listened to the whole --President Trump's whole speech before you started walking? 
9 
10 
11 
12 A Yes, sir. 
Q Okay. So he finishes speaking around 1:13 p.m. 
A 
Q I don't recall the time here. 
I'm representing that to you so that --we're just trying to set a timetable 
13 here. And then you started walking. So you probably got to the Capitol sometime 
14 later, at 1:45. 
A I walk with a cane, so it would have been a while. 15 
16 Q Okay. But by the time you got there people were already hanging on 
17 scaffolding. So is that, what, the inaugural stage? Do you remember, like, 
18 scaffolding --91 
19 A I don't recall that, but it's on the side of the Capitol where the justice lady is 
20 with the blindfold and the scales, that side of the Capitol. 
21 Q Right. And then --so that's the west side. That's the Peace Circle, the 
22 statute that you're remembering. Did you then walk over --
23 
24 
25 A It's the side I was on. 
Q Okay. You never walked to the east side --
A No.  1 
2 Q 
A 92 
--where the Supreme Court is? So the west side --
1 have in the past. I entered, when I visited the Department of Homeland 
3 Security, I entered on that side. You go underground and you go to the lunchroom, and 
4 then after the lunchroom, you go to an elevator to go to the --
5 Q Mr. Watkins --
6 A The room was like the San Francisco Room, and it had art made out of ivory 
7 on the wall. And I thought that was beautiful and also illegal. 
8 Q Anyway, Mr. Watkins, on January 6th specifically, so how close to the Capitol 
9 did you get on the west side? 
10 
11 
12 A 
Q 
A 
13 scaffolding. 
14 
15 
16 Q 
A 
Q Perhaps 200 meters. 
Okay. So you were on the grass? 
I don't recall if it was grass or cement, but I was before you got to the 
Okay. But after that statute you mentioned? 
Yes, sir. 
Okay. And let's say it's around 2 o'clock. The first breach at the Capitol 
17 appears at 2:13 p.m. By that time people have been scuffling with police for a long 
18 time, so --
19 A Nobody was scuffling with the police there, sir, nobody. There was zero 
20 police scuffling that was in visible of my range. 
21 
22 
23 Q 
A 
Q 
24 were there. 
25 A I was going to ask you --
There was no police scuffling there, and there were 3 million people there. 
Again, that is your take. That is your understanding of how many people 
There is overhead images of it that I've seen that you can actually estimate  1 the number of people. 
2 Q Mr. Watkins, did you hear any loud explosions or other sounds when you 
3 were near the Capitol? 
4 
5 
6 
7 A 
Q 
A 
Q No, sir. 
You didn't hear any people shouting and not in a -­
There were lots of people shouting. 
Yeah, sorry. I was still going. Not in a, you know, peaceful rally sort of 
8 way, but more in a shouting like violence or other things? 
9 
10 A 
Q No, sir. 
Okay. What did you see while you were --you said 200 meters --I'm 
11 sorry --200 meters from the Capitol? 
That's my guess, yeah. 
Okay. So what were you seeing? 93 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Just wall to wall people. It was like --have you ever been in a mash pit, sir? 
I have actually. 
That's what it was like, only it was millions of people in a mash pit. 
A mash pit can be --
I'm surprised nobody was trampled. 
So by the time you get to the Capitol, Vice President Pence has already sent 
20 out or tweeted out his letter saying --
21 A I doubt by the time I got there, sir, that Vice President Pence was even in the 
22 Capitol. 
23 Q No, I understand. I'm saying by the time you got there he had already 
24 publicly announced that he was not going to do anything to disrupt President Biden's 
25 victory. So was anybody around you talking about Vice President -- 94 
1 A But I wouldn't have known that at the time, sir, because we didn't have any 
2 communications and the internet was jammed or overwhelmed. 
3 Q Was anybody --
4 A So I only knew what the people in the mash pit were talking about, so I 
5 didn't know what --
6 
7 
8 
9 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Mr. Watkins, if you let me ask the question. I was going to ask -­
But you're leading the question --
I'm giving you context for the question, Mr. Watkins, I'm giving you context. 
Yeah. 
Timing. I'm trying to explain the timing of it. 10 
11 So it is a matter of fact that around 1 p.m. Vice President Pence sends out the 
12 letter saying he's not going to object. So by the time he gets to the Capitol it was out 
13 there in the world. 
14 Was anybody around you talking about Vice President Pence? 
15 A No, sir. And as to what you're saying, nobody where I was even knew that 
16 because we had no telephone service, we had no internet service, we had no --it was like 
17 there's no communication at that time. 
18 
19 Q 
A Okay. Did you go anywhere else around the Capitol on January 6th? 
The next communication I had that had anything to do with electronic 
20 communication is when Mayor Bowser sent out, like, a civil alert and said that there was, 
21 like, martial law or something and that we had to leave, and everybody left. 
22 
23 Q 
A So people left once they got the notification about a curfew at 6 p.m.? 
It was a peaceful withdrawal at that time as well. We all left. We walked 
24 away. And I went to a Cuban restaurant next to the Hamilton Hotel, and the food was 
25 wonderful.  95 
Okay. Mr.1111 1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 The Witness. And I have witnesses that were there with me that day, so --
8 on. 
9 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Mr. Watkins, did you see anyone entering the Capitol from the West Front? 
No, you couldn't see that from where I was. That was --
Did you see people --
The videos that I've seen, it wasn't even the same side of the Capitol I was 
Well, I can represent to you that people did enter the Capitol, as-
10 mentioned, from the west side as well as the east side. But you didn't see anyone. 
11 A I thought it was on the south side, but I may be mistaken. I was on the side 
12 of the Capitol that the Washington Monument is on. 
13 
14 Q 
A The west side. That's the west side. 
Okay. That's the side I was on. I thought it was the south side. See how 
15 mistaken I was? 
16 
17 Q 
A But either way, you didn't see anyone entering the Capitol? 
No, sir. You can't see that far. It's up. It's up, you know. You can't see 
18 what's going on up there. 
19 Q 
20 Capitol? 
21 
22 
23 A 
Q 
A Were you at any point concerned that individuals were trespassing on the 
How do you trespass on the Capitol, sir? I've been inside the Capitol. 
Did you ever see individuals stop people --
And I didn't have an appointment when I went in. I sat down in the gallery 
24 and I watched what's going on there. I've done that before. Haven't you? 
25 Q Right, I have.  1 
2 
3 
4 On the west side of the Capitol, there were windows broken into --
A 
Q 
A Yeah, but you couldn't see that from where I was, so -­
Did you see individuals crossing police lines? 
Not where I was, you couldn't see that, no, sir. 
5 Did you see individuals running up the steps at all on the west side 
6 towards the higher up ground of the Capitol? 96 
7 The Witness. There were steps there, but there was nobody running. It was a 
8 walking. There was a line. 
9 
10 Q Were you aware that the Capitol was closed to the public on January 6th 
11 given the threats made against the joint session? 
12 A No, sir. How would I be aware of that? There was no internet or 
13 telephone communication available. 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 that. 
19 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q And it was COVID, so there were already restrictions on entry. 
I wasn't aware of that either. 
Okay. 
I was aware of COVID, but I didn't know there was any restriction because of 
So at any point in the crowd did individuals speak with you about wanting to 
20 go inside the Capitol? 
21 A Just that guy with the beanie and a gray --he was in, like, a gray official 
22 looking uniform with a beanie and a megaphone. But everyone was ignoring him and 
23 they were telling him to just shut up because he was being an idiot. 
24 So what did people hope would happen when they were all gathering 
25 at the Capitol?  97 
1 The Witness. Well, what do you think? I don't know what other people were 
2 thinking, sir. 
4 didn't know about Vice President Pence. So I'm asking you about your impression of the 
5 crowd. 
6 What did you take the purpose of everyone gathering around the Capitol on 
7 January 6th to be? 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 The Witness. Please restate that. 
Mr. Barr. Yes. I would object for speculation. You can feel free --
The Witness. I can give you opinions all day long, but they mean nothing. 
- Well, your opinions mean something. You were there. 
The Witness. Yeah. 
13 - So I'm asking, what did you take the purpose of the gathering on 
14 Capitol Grounds and up at the Capitol on January 6th? 
15 The Witness. The people that were there wanted to make sure that they had 
16 our objection. 3 million people, 1 percent of America gathered in one place is a serious 
17 amount of people. And them wanting things to be taken a look at is a fair supposition. 
18 Mr. Barr. Supposition I think is the word. 
19 
20 
21 Q 
A B 
I think you broke up for a little bit. But did you say fair supposition? 
I think that's the word. Does that mean that you're guessing what they're 
22 thinking about? 
23 Q Oh, okay. Yeah, I see what you're saying. Yeah. It broke up for a little 
24 bit. That's all I was saying. I was just confirming what you said, not questioning your 
25 words.  98 
1 A I just want to make sure that gets through. I may have the wrong meaning 
2 of it.

12 
13 
14 doors. 
15 
16 Q No. That's fine. 
Do you think that using violence to --
A 
Q There was no violence -­
Let me finish the question. 
Do you think that using violence to get that point across would have been okay? 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A No, sir. 
Okay. 
And I would have defended against violence. 
BY 
Was it appropriate for individuals to enter the Capitol that day? 
How would I know? They let them in. I saw videos of them opening the 
Was it appropriate for individuals to break through windows? 
But it's not my guess as to whether it was appropriate or not. I have no 
17 comment on that other than my opinion. 
18 
19 Q 
A No comment on breaking through windows? 
I think that they were let in. They opened the doors. And those are 
20 magnetic doors. They don't open automatically. 
21 
22 
23 Q 
A BY 
So you're seeing videos of people going into the Capitol? 
I've seen videos of people going in. I've seen videos of the guards letting 
24 them in, police, guards, whatever they are. 
25 Q We talked about this earlier a little bit. Since then have you seen videos of  99 
1 any violence occurring on the Capitol on January 6th? 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Of course. I saw there looked like pushing and scuffling and what have you. 
So there was violence? 
I've seen the picture of Ashli Babbitt being murdered. 
So there was violence --
I've seen --that was inside, and that was --I don't even know what part of 
7 the Capitol that was in. That was inside. I saw Ashli Babbitt being shot by somebody. 
8 
9 
10 Q 
A BY-
That was near the House Chamber. 
Yeah. See, I've never been to that place in there. I don't know where that 
11 was. But I saw the picture of her being murdered. 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Do you believe what happened that day was legitimate political protest? 
I believe that was murder, sir. 
Do you believe what happened that day was legitimate political protest? 
Not the murder, no. 
No, the entry into the Capitol. 
What I was doing that day was legitimate political protest. What they were 
18 doing, I think that some of those people probably broke the law. 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Okay. Understood. 
But I don't think it was an attack or an insurrection on our government. 
So what do you think it was? 
Obviously, it was a trespassing of some kind. 
And the fact that there was conversation sort of in --
No. There's no other facts than that. It's obvious that I was not over 
25 there. I don't know what they were doing. They entered --we know they entered.  100 
1 You've seen the video. I've seen the video. Everyone has seen the video. They went 
2 in there. People were pushing. But mostly it was people marching around taking 
3 selfies. 
4 
5 
6 Q 
A 
Q You don't believe that people were there to target Vice President Pence? 
No, sir. 
Okay. So I wanted to ask now about --it seems like the answer will be no 
7 because you didn't have cell service --but were there any --we talked earlier about the 
8 ability to shut down 8kun during an emergency. 
9 Did you do that on January 6th? 
10 
11 
12 
13 A 
Q 
A 
Q No, sir. 
Okay. Were you monitoring 8kun on January 6th at all? 
Probably in the morning before I went outside. 
Okay. Was there anything that you remember removing as inappropriate 
14 that morning? 
15 
16 
17 A 
Q Not that I can recall, no. 
Okay. Can we pull up exhibit 20, 
I think it's a different --we can get you this URL. I don't have it handy right now. 
18 I'm sorry. 
19 So this is a post on January 6th at it looks like almost 3 o'clock eastern time. And 
20 this is as the Capitol was being breached. And the post says, "Guns are out 
21 now" --"Guns are out. This is now a civil war. Go. Go. Go." 
22 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A 
Q I've never seen this post before. 
Okay. Well, would this violate 8kun's policies? 
Probably. If it was reported to me, I would delete this. 
Okay. Well, we can get you that URL and you can delete it.  101 
1 A But I wouldn't delete it now. I wouldn't delete it now because it's after the 
2 fact. 
3 
4 
5 Q 
A 
Q So that actually leads me to my next question. 
[Inaudible.] 
You cut out for a second. 
6 My next question actually was whether or not you went back after January 6th 
7 and tried to delete any posts that were in violation. Did you do that? 
8 
9 A 
Q 
10 violence? 
11 
12 
13 A 
Q 
A No, sir. 
Why wouldn't you remove those posts if they were violent or called for 
Because then they would be historical. I'm not into rewriting history, sir. 
Okay. 
In fact, that's part of the reason that I stand so strong on what I do, is 
14 because I've seen governments attempt to rewrite history. And they attempt to coerce 
15 me into allowing it and I don't. 
16 Q 
17 platform --
18 A 
19 at that time. 
20 
21 Q 
A So threats of violence that are specific are not removed from your 
Well, I didn't see this when it happened because I was, like, incommunicado 
Right. But you would have removed it --
That was at 1455. I mean, I was, like, standing out in the freezing cold 
22 then. That's right before Mayor Bowser called civil rest --what do they call it when 
23 they --martial law. 
24 Q So you would have removed this post if you had seen it earlier? Is that 
25 what you're saying?  102 
1 A If it had happened, like, if I was at my office looking at this and someone 
2 reported it, yeah, I would have removed it because it's obviously a threat. But if it's 
3 already past, then I'm not going to remove it because it's history then. You know, we 
4 live at a moment. Before this [inaudible] and the future is undetermined. So if this has 
5 already happened, then it's just history, sir. 
6 Q Why do you think a call to take up arms against the government is important 
7 to keep on a platform?

Q 
A 
Q Where is the image that went with this? 
What? 
Where is the image that went with this? You have the image removed. 
Oh, I don't think it came up on the message board. We'll send you the link. 
12 It wasn't showing up for us. 
13 
14 up. 
15 
16 A 
Q 
A This may have even come from the deleted files if the image is not showing 
It didn't. This is from something that was --
Someone may have deleted it. Maybe one of the global volunteers. I'm 
17 not familiar with it. Let's look for it. 
18 
19 Q 
A We can move on if there's no other conversation on this. 
Yeah, because, I mean, that could have come out of my banned/deleted list 
20 that I showed you, for all I know, because the images don't show up when you use that. 
21 - And just as a general matter --sorry, Mr .• 
22 The Witness. During that time I was standing outside in the freezing cold with 
23 the documentary guy and another friend of mine, and his videographer was there. 
24 BY 
25 Q So, Mr. Watkins, as a general matter, between December 19th, 2020, and  103 
1 January 6th, 2021, did you see a lot of posts on 8kun about civil war, revolutionary war, 
2 anything like that? 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 A Me personally, no. 
Q Do you know if there were posts about that on 8kun between those times? 
A There could have been. 
Q Is that a topic of --
A If you have one, we can talk about it, but I don't know. 
Q Well, we're looking at one right now. So I'm just asking if there were 
9 others --
10 A We're looking at one that happened when I was in the yard in front of the 
11 Capitol. 
12 Q Sure. And I'm just using this to ask if others like it showed up on 8kun 
13 between December 19th and January 6th? 
14 
15 
16 
17 A I don't know. Did they? I really don't. 
Q Okay. 
A I would tell you if I knew. 
Q Was it generally spoken about on 8kun? Was revolutionary war a topic of 
18 conversation often on 8kun? 
19 
20 A Not that I know of. 
Q Okay. And after January 6th and up through the inauguration, were there 
21 also posts about civil war or revolutionary war on 8kun? 
22 A I think people talk about right now that we're in what's called a digital war. 
23 And we have people trying to rewrite history and trying to establish their narratives and 
24 push it with propaganda. And then we have other people that are trying to debunk that 
25 propaganda. And that's sort of a digital war.  1 
2

4 
5 
6 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A But specifically the revolutionary war, civil war? 
Excuse me, sir? 
Never mind. We can move on. 
Thank you. 
I think Mr.llllcan come back to this. 
Thank you. Well, I won't come back to this. 
7 BY-104 
8 Q Actually I have posts I want to discuss. And apologies, I'll have to give you 
9 the hyperlinks later. These are posts that were made, to-point, after 
10 January 6th, and I wanted to ask you about some of those and the ongoing threat of 
11 violence. 
12 A Ask away, but don't try to put words in my mouth because you'll just piss me 
13 off. 
14 Q We're not trying to put words in your mouth. We're just trying to ask you 
15 about posts that were on your website --
16 
17

19 
20 
21 
22 
23

25 A 
Q

A 
Q 
A Thank you. 
--or remain on your website. 
Thank you. 
So we're --
You said we were going to take a break? 
Do you want to take a break? We can take a break for 10 minutes. 
I have to pee. 
- Sure. Let's come back at 1:10, take a 15-minute break. 
The Witness. Thank you. 
We're off the record at 12:54.  105 
[Recess.] 
- So if we're all ready, we can go back on the record at 1:11. 1 
2 
3 And hopefully we are making good progress and can be done with this relatively 
4 soon, Mr. Watkins. Thank you again for your cooperation. 
5 At this point we've moved beyond January 6th, and I wanted to show you a couple 
6 of posts, and we can provide the URL. I also have the URL to the last post we were 
7 talking about, a civil war post that was part of I think one of the same threads that we 
8 talked about earlier. 
9 But, nevertheless, I want to talk about some posts after January 6th that talk 
10 about potential violence. And, obviously, there were some threats against Congress in 
11 the days after the 6th leading up to the inauguration. I wanted to just ask you about 
12 some of those. 
13 So, first, we can pull up exhibit 21. 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 Mr. Barr. And you said you have a URL for this? 
- Yes. One second. Let me make sure I've got them all straight. 
This is the URL for 21 coming in. 
Mr. Barr. Okay. 
BY-
Q So I can read it out loud if that works. 
A 
Q 
A No. Let me read it. 
Sure. 
"Reminder that the Capitol siege was not carried out by antifa. They want 
23 to demoralize us by thinking it was antifa and by thinking the cops let them in and by 
24 thinking it was staged. They are terrified that we will use the siege, along with the 
25 martyr Ashli, to embolden us to do something bigger soon. That is why they are shilling  106 
1 to try to convince us it was all fake/antifa/staged." 
2 Q So this seems to contradict some of what you personally believe about antifa 
3 and the police letting in protesters. Is that correct? 
4 A Well, I don't know who posted this, and it's posted on the politically 
5 incorrect board, which mostly is full of, like, conjecture stuff. 
6 Q Right. Actually one clarifying question. Do you know what the use of the 
7 three parentheses around the "they" is? I don't know, what is that referring to? 
8 
9 A 
Q Well, that's emphasis, I'm sure. 
All right. And so the post there, "to embolden us to do something bigger 
10 soon," given the landscape of threats, continuing threats against Congress, threats of 
11 violence against the inauguration, was there any discussion of trying to take action 
12 against some of these posts in the national climate between the 6th and the 
13 inauguration? 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 A 
Q This post is protected speech for sure. 
Okay. So we can go into exhibit 22 then. 
Mr. Barr. Could-we have a URL for this? 
Yes. I'm getting it up. 
Oh, 22 is the same URL, just scrolling later down in the thread. 
The Witness. This has to do with Ashli Babbitt being murdered. "A patriot 
20 woman died for merely walking" --
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 - No. This post begins, "Keep killing Jews and leftards." 
The Witness. Okay. 
Mr. Barr. Do you want me to pull it up on --
The Witness. No, I can see that. I see what it says. 
"Keep killing Jews and leftards all over America or nothing good happen to White  107 
1 men. Fail to do so and the White race will be enslaved in America. 
2 "A patriot woman died for merely walking, White niggers and kikes are binding 
3 then burning people alive and not even arrested, let alone shot." 
4 This is someone who has a pretty serious opinion, it looks like. 
5 BY 
6 
7 Q So the next line, "And that is a lesson that all pacifist retards should learn" --
8 same --
9 
10 A 
Q 
A This is a different person posting, by the way, than the first one. If it's the 
I'm not really interested in --
Yeah. But, sir, this person is replying to the first post you showed me, but 
11 it's a different person posting. 
12 Q Right. And this person is saying that the lesson for "pacifist retards," 
13 quote/unquote, is that everything can be solved only through violence. 
14 
15 A Well, they feel that way. I don't feel that way. 
Q Okay. And this, again, would not be a specific enough threat in the wake of 
16 January 6th to remove from 8kun? 
17 
18 
19 A This doesn't need to be removed, no. 
Q Okay. We can go on to exhibit 23, and I'll provide a URL. 
A "Trump is either a traitor or dead as confirmed by his Twitter post 
20 disavowing his supporters who stomped the Capitol. With Trump out of the 
21 way" --stormed the Capitol, sorry, it's hard to see --"Trump out of the way, no longer 
22 holding back his supporters, the MAGA movement is unshackled. On January 20th, 
23 MAGA beamers, emboldened by the January 6th happenings, will storm the Capitol, but 
24 instead of a few hundred, it will be tens of thousands this time, and they will be armed. 
25 "The black flag (Ashli Babbitt's flag) will fly above the dome. The happening of  108 
1 our lifetimes is at hand. Spread this on Cuck, Chan, Poll, Reddit, and anywhere Q 
2 beamers will see it. It begins." 
3 
4 
5 This has a lot of replies to it, and that's probably the most important part of this. 
Mr. Barr. Let me bring it up. 
The Witness. Okay. Because it looks like something that was posted to incite 
6 people to, like, reply. Look at all these replies. 
7 
8 BY-
Q So, sir, I understand there were replies. What I'm curious about is asking 
9 about the particular post that we are talking about, which is clearly inciting people to 
10 violence, to storm the Capitol armed on January 20th. This is not --
11 A But this is posted on the 21st, sir. This is posted a day after the 20th. This 
12 is what's called a LARP or it's a --they trolled you. They posted this a day after the 
13 event. They posted January 20th. 
14 
15 
16 Q No. It says --
A But it says 21st here. So obviously this is a troll. 
Q Sir, '21 is the year. This is posted on January 8th, shortly after the Capitol 
17 storming. 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 A Oh. 
Q Twelve days before the inauguration. 
A Well, it's the first I've seen it, so --
Q So would you agree that this is a --
A It says, "The journalists and Feds will actually believe this." There's other 
23 stuff on here. I don't agree with this post, no. It's the first I've seen it. 
24 
25 Q 
A I'm not asking if you agree with it. I'm asking if it violates 8kun's policy. 
Absolutely, but it wasn't reported, so it won't be deleted. And now it's  1 after the fact so it won't be deleted. 
Were you concerned about posts that would --
1 never saw this. It would have been deleted if I had saw it. 
Did you delete --
1 would have deleted it on January 8th if it was reported. 109 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Did you delete any posts between January 6th and January 20th calling for 
7 violence? 
8 
9 
10 
11 A 
Q 
A 
Q I don't remember, sir. 
Okay. 
If I did, there's a record. 
Understood. 
12 Are there any --would you ever have concerns that individuals on your platform 
13 wouldn't report this kind of content and then you would have --it would stay up and 
14 potentially cause violence to be organized? 
15 
16 A 
Q Sir? 
Yes. 
17 A We are in compliance with the law. The legislators that you are 
18 representing right now are the ones that write the law. We comply with that law. We 
19 are unmoderated. We are a blank piece of paper. We are the closest thing on the 
20 internet you could be to being what's called, like, a common carrier, like picking up your 
21 cell phone and calling somebody. 
22 Now, they don't have a law on that yet, but eventually they will over time. But in 
23 the meantime we're unmoderated. That means that we don't know what's happening 
24 on our website until it's reported. 
25 Now, I read the website all the time, but, you know, there's thousands and  110 
1 thousands of posts. How could I possibly read everything? And these people over on 
2 this board are really not people I'm interested in having any sort of communication with. 
3 You know, they're not my kind of people at all. 
4 But, for the most part, posts that happen on that P&D board are the most 
5 protected speech in America. That's already been to the Supreme Court. It's like the 
6 Nazis that parade through Jewish neighborhoods. 
7 
8 Q 
A Okay. 
This is protected speech, and that's what this board is about. This 
9 particular post wouldn't have been protected, but it's after the fact so it doesn't matter 
10 now. 
11 
12 Q 
A What if there were --
You just reported it to me, and it's after the fact. If you had reported that 
13 to me on January 8th, it would have been deleted. 
14 Q So you didn't feel it was your responsibility to tell global volunteers to look 
15 for anything in particular about the inauguration? 
16 
17 
18 A 
Q 
A That would be publishing, sir. We are not a publisher. We are a platform. 
All right. That's helpful. 
There's a big difference. Twitter is a publisher. Google is a publisher. 
19 Facebook is a publisher. We are a platform. 
20 We are one of the few sites actually in America that is in compliance with the law. 
21 Those people are not in compliance with the law. However, they're billionaires, so they 
22 get away with it. I'm not a billionaire. I have to figure out how I'm going to pay my 
23 attorney for this day. 
24 Q Uh-huh. So we have one more post that was not deleted that I want to ask 
25 you about, and I understand the answer might be the same, but I just wanted to ask you  111 
1 about it and then we can move on. And it's exhibit 24. 
2 A "This time there won't be any standing down. Guerilla squads are already 
3 getting prepared to storm the Federal Reserve and other buildings in the surrounding 
4 area" --I would have remembered this if it happened then, I don't recall 
5 this --"including the Capitol and White House. Communication" --this would have been 
6 impossible at that time because you had a big fence around Washington, D.C. 
7 "We have a special surprise in store for Jack." Twitter is Jack Dorsey. That is 
8 who that is. 
9 
10 Q 
A So this post --
"Do not come on the 17th if you are not ready to die. This will end in 
11 bloodshed. If you are not willing to give your life for the Constitution and for the good 
12 of the future, then do not show up. The gloves are off. This isn't about Trump 
13 anymore. This is about justice and freedom for all the rights of American citizens. And 
14 Twitter? We have a special surprise in store for Jack." 
15 Okay. Yeah, that probably would have been deleted for sure. That was 
16 January 9th. But as I said, it's the first I've seen this post. 
17 Q So looking over these posts, are you concerned that your team of global 
18 volunteers is not sufficient to comb through illegal content on the platform? 
19 A Sir, I didn't say that. 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q I'm asking you the question. Are you concerned --
No, I didn't say that. You asked me a question as a declaration. 
I'm wondering if you are concerned --
No, I'm not. 
Okay. Were there ever any discussions of increasing the number of global 
25 volunteers you had after January 6th?  1 
2 
3 
4 A 
Q 
A 
Q Would you like to volunteer? 
I'm just asking you if you had any discussion about it. 
No, not that I recall. 
Thank you. 
5 I feel like our team has referred a number of posts for removal today, so 
6 hopefully --
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A They won't be removed because they're after the fact. 
What if there are ongoing threats? 
They're history now, •. 
So under what circumstances would threats be considered -­
Imminent threats. I'm going to kill the Emperor on this bridge on 
12 Wednesday. Things like that. 
13 Q Okay. 112 
14 A And I'm using that as an example because that's actually happened before, 
15 and we've worked with law enforcement over that. 
16 Q So can you give me a sense of what the nature of your interactions with law 
17 enforcement have been like? You said you're able to provide URLs. 
18 A I've always worked with law enforcement. I've provided that to Congress 
19 multiple times. I've provided it to the FBI as well when that --what was his --Mick 
20 something --I forget his name now --the assistant director went up there and said, I 
21 never heard of 8chan before. 
22 So I sent him all of it immediately, and I called too, and I sent him all the 
23 interactions that we've had with the FBI. And, of course, he didn't ever post that there. 
24 So he was kind of a --
25 Q Did you have interactions with the FBI following January 6th?  113 
I have. 
About your involvement on the day or about 8kun's activity? 1 
2 
3 A 
Q 
A They came --they sent three agents to interview me, and I've forgotten their 
4 names, and they didn't give me their cards. Officers, they're FBI officers. 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A And what was the nature of that interview about? 
Similar to the questions you're asking me now, •. 
So it was mainly about your activities on the day, not activity on 8kun? 
Yes, sir. 
Okay. 
8kun is in compliance with the law. You're, you know, attempting to 
11 embarrass me over it. But you know what? I've been embarrassed worse than this by 
12 them lying about me all over the news, so --
13 
14 Q 
A We're just here --
You're at least not lying. You're just showing me stuff that I didn't know 
15 about when at the time. 
16 Q Just trying to figure out the facts. 
17 So I had a couple of other questions I had for you about the production that you 
18 sent to us, some of the letters that you sent over to us. 
19 
20 A 
Q Yes, sir. 
And I thought that we could go over some of those. And then I have a 
21 couple of closing questions that I would like to get your thoughts on, and then we can 
22 hopefully wrap up pretty soon. 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q Yes, sir. 
And I appreciate you bearing with us. 
So first I wanted to ask before we get to that, you said there hasn't been much  1 activity by Q since January 6th? 
A 
Q 
A 
Q There's been no Q activity. 
Okay. Do you have any reason to believe that the user is still active? 
I don't even know if he's still alive. 
Okay. And that's great to know. 114

6 
7 
8 
9 I want to make sure that we get the right exhibit up. So. 
get up exhibit 6? can we 
10 
11 
12 So this is a letter that you sent to us that --
A 
Q 
A 
Q I have it, if I can find it. 
--you received from a man named Robert Morss? 
Yes, sir. He's a political prisoner right now. 
All right. So Mr. Morss was accused of, among other things, handing stolen 
13 police shields to other rioters and climbing through --
14 
15 A 
Q I don't know what he was accused of, sir. 
Well, I'm representing to you that is what he was accused of, handing stolen 
16 police shields to other rioters and going through a broken window in the Capitol. 
17 So why do you think that's a political --constitutes being a political prisoner? 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Has he been convicted? 
I don't believe so. 
Has he been to trial yet? 
I'm not aware of that, sir. 
Has he gotten a speedy trial? Has it been over a year? You know, these 
23 are lots of questions. 
24 I don't know Mr. Morss. 
25 Q So what was the nature of your communications with him?  1 
2 
3 
4 jail. A 
Q 
A I just write letters to prisoners because it's a ministry I'm involved with. 
Can you describe that more broadly? 115 
It's part of being a good Catholic, sir. Good Catholics minister to those in  1

5 
6 
7 Q 
A 
Q 
A Okay. And you chose to start doing this with --
There's a --
--prisoners --
--patriotmailproject.org, and I got addresses from there, and I sent 
8 hundreds of letters. These are the responses that I got back. 
9 
10 Q 
A That makes sense. 
I feel really bad for these people not having --now, whether he's guilty or 
11 not, whatever he's guilty of, his punishment has been the process, obviously, because 
12 he's probably not even seen a judge or a court yet. And that's, like, heinous. That's, 
13 like, offensive to any sort of American institution. I mean, we have a right to speedy 
14 trial. I mean, he practically doesn't have habeas corpus rights. I mean, think about 116 
15 what he's got there. You know, it's awful. You know, the court system in Washington, 
16 D.C., is obviously a big problem. 
17 Q That is helpful context. 
18 So, in this letter --and I was wondering if you can enlighten me --he writes back 
19 to you. 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 And I think if you can scroll down a little bit. 
This is on page 2. 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Hmm? 
And he says that you both share similar opinions during America's 11th hour. 
Well, I don't know if I share a similar opinion with him or not, but --
So I was wondering if you could expand on that.  117 
1 A --I definitely would've been passing out police shields at the event that he 
2 was at. 
3 
4 
5 Q Okay. 
And then towards the bottom of the page --it might be the next page­
Veah, keep scrolling. I can't see. 
6 So towards the end of the page, he says, "The American people must rise, and 
7 they will, should you choose to gallantly encourage them." 
8 I was wondering if you had any idea what he was talking about there. 
9 A No. 
10 But I do see at the beginning of that, "I need your help, Jim, and we need the help 
11 of those who will listen to you, for we have now personally understood the painful reality 
12 of the adage, 'In order for evil to succeed, all a good man need do is nothing at all."' 
13 So I understand what he's talking about. I didn't do what he did. 
14 And I recall translating this Morse code, but I don't remember the exact words on 
15 it, but it's something to do with either the Ranger or the Special Forces creed, and I 
16 thought that was sweet. 
17 Q So, if we can pull up now --
18 A And I'm also glad that these guys at least have their letters being submitted 
19 to Congress. Whether or not --you know, I'm not the judge, and I don't know if they're 
20 guilty or not guilty, but I know that they're presumed innocent until proven guilty. 
21 
22 
23 in --
24 
25 Q 
A 
Q 
A I guess I'm curious about the term "political prisoner" --
No, that's America, sir. People are presumed innocent until proven guilty 
I very much -­
Yeah.  118 
1 Q --agree with that sentiment --that principle, rather. 
2 I was curious about the use of the term "political prisoners" to describe 
3 several --and it occurs in several of these exhibits. 
They're using those themselves. Like -- 4 
5 A 
Q Earlier, you said that you consider them political prisoners. So could I ask 
6 why you think that? 
7 A I do consider them political prisoners. Even Congress ignores them, except 
8 for the people that have been condemned by Congress that are in Congress. I think 
9 Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene went there and inspected the facility, and she 
10 did a large report on it, and she was appalled by it. 
11 And things in her report back up these letters that these guys have wrote me 
12 about, like them not being able to cut their hair or shave, which is why I'm unkempt at 
13 this time. I used to be in the Army, and I usually keep my hair fairly short. I did have a 
14 bigger mustache, but that was --you know, I'm not in the Army anymore. 
15 
16 Q 
A Uh-huh. 
But that's why I'm not cutting my hair, because the prison warden is not 
17 allowing them to shave or cut their hair. 
18 
19 
20 Q 
A 
Q Understood. 
And that's --that's gross. I mean, they're treating these guys cruelly. 
So there are a couple of letters that you've received. I understand you 
21 can't necessarily speak to all of their contents. There is one letter that you produced to 
22 us that you sent. 
23 S~f we can pull up exhibit 12. 
24 And this is a letter from you to Peter Stager, who was accused of beating an 
25 officer with a flagpole, and that was captured on video.  1 
2 Oh. Maybe --
A I don't know what he was accused of. And it's like I said; I received --I 119 
3 received a list from patriotmailproject.org of people that needed to have letters written 
4 to, and I wrote letters to them. They were very generic letters. 
5 And --let's see. I just scanned that one when I started scanning these letters 
6 that they returned to me. I included that as an example of what kind of letter I was 
7 writing to these people. 
8 
9 
10 
11 Q Okay. 
And it's exhibit 13, if we could --yeah. 
So you weren't aware of who Mr. Stager was when you were writing the letter? 
A This is a return letter. He told me that he was --I recall the first 
12 letter --and it may or may not be in there, because I don't have a complete record of 
13 them. I scanned the ones I could still find. 
14 
15 Q 
A Uh-huh. 
He was a foraging for greens in the prison yard, because they were not giving 
16 him any vegetables to eat. And I believe that he had done some horticulture of some 
17 kind and had been to the University of Davis. 
18 Q So, in this letter, I'm curious, I'm asking about one line in particular. You 
19 say towards the middle of the page, "We are still doing our best to wake up the country." 
20 I'm curious what you meant by that. 
21 A Don't believe or trust the D.C. TV. 
22 And that's --I've mentioned that already, where in D.C. they had President 
23 Trump's lips moving but somebody else paraphrasing what he was saying, you know. 
24 They couldn't trust the President of the United States to actually speak on TV in 
25 Washington, D.C.  120 
1 And I've told him that here in this letter, so it's exactly what I was talking about. 
2 I see that. "Trump's lips moving on FOX, but his voice was muted, with commenting 
3 over it," which is exactly what I meant. 
4 Mr. Barr. Mr .• could you point out the sentence you were asking about? 
5 - Sure. Yeah. So it's --I'm trying to count the lines --one, two, three 
6 lines down from the "read his lips" part. It's towards the end of that line. 
7 
8 
9 The Witness. "You're a hostage and being used to scare the attendees"? 
10 Q 
A BY-
Yeah. Yes. 
I do believe that. I do believe that these political prisoners that they've 
11 taken are being used to keep those 3 million people that peacefully attended silent. 
12 And it's effective. It's obviously effective, isn't it? 
13 
14 Q 
A I'm not sure how. Can you explain to me? 
They're not speaking up, are they? They're being --they're all scared to 
15 death of having to spend money on an attorney to defend themselves like I'm doing 
16 today, sir. 
17 Q 
18 country?" 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A And what did you mean by "we're still doing our best to wake up the 
My words here, I'm sure, say exactly what I meant. 
What does the country have to be woken up to? 
What do you think? What is this meeting about? 
Unfortunately, you can't ask the --
That the election was stolen and --
Unfortunately, I'm the one asking questions. 
--that we have selected Representatives instead of elected Representatives  121 
1 in the lower house in Congress; that the Congress, the lower house of Congress, is doing 
2 judicial work, legislative work, and executive work, which is supposed to be separated. 
3 They have, I think it's called separation of powers, but they're doing all three out of the 
4 lower house of Congress. And that's amazing. That's awful. 
5 This week, I've heard show trials start, which is Soviet-style. 
6 
7 Q 
A I'm not sure I --
Don't they start on Thursday? Doesn't Bennie Thompson have his reality 
8 show trial starting on Thursday, primetime? 
9 
10 
11 
12 Q 
A 
Q 
A Ah. The hearings. 
I've heard --yeah. Show trials. 
Well, we appreciate --
The Communists in Soviet Russia did this exact same thing. They didn't 
13 have TV at the time, but it's the same situation. 
14 Q Well, we appreciate you giving us context as we gather the facts in this 
15 investigation. 
16 
17 
18 A 
Q You're welcome. 
And so --we can take the exhibit down, 
And I don't think we have to walk through the other exhibits. I had a couple of 
19 closing questions, and I do want to open it up for others as well. 
20 Given some of the posts we looked at, are you concerned for the potential for 
21 future calls to violence on 8kun? 
22 A Sir, I'm not an ESP person. I don't have any idea what's gonna happen in 
23 the future. I've written a book on future history, but that's fiction. 
24 Q Uh-huh. 
25 A It's really fiction. I'm not really able to see into the future.  122 
1 Q Granted. 
2 I did have a few quick cleanup questions. 
3 Just wanted to confirm regarding your son, Ron Watkins, can you tell us today that 
4 Ron Watkins is not the Q account poster? 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 A 
Q Ron Watkins has said multiple times he's not Q, as have I. 
Okay. Thank you. 
Mr. Barr. We're losing audio here. Hopefully we get this back. 
- All right. Can you hear me? 
Mr. Barr. There you go. 
B 
Q Did Ron ever talk to you about the December 19th tweet by President Trump 
12 telling people to come to D.C.? 
13 
14 A 
Q I don't recall, sir. 
And have you spoken with Ron about his compliance with the select 
15 committee's subpoena? 
16 
17 
18 
19 A 
Q I didn't know he'd been subpoenaed. 
Okay. 
Well--
A The last time I saw him was on the Apache Indian Reservation at a speech 
20 with Wendy Rogers. And there were several other political candidates there. They 
21 were running for different positions in Arizona. 
22 Q Got it. 
23 So, before we close, I just want to ask a couple of forward-looking questions, and 
24 I'd be very interested to hear your thoughts on them, if you wouldn't mind. 
25 The first is: We've talked a lot about threats that faced America over the last  123 
1 couple months. What are your biggest concerns about the threats facing America now? 
2 A Well, if you're bringing up Ron Watkins, he's been threatened with his 
3 life --by politicians, actually, publicly. I think he's one of the --but they apologized later, 
4 but, I mean, acts of contrition don't make up for the fact that you committed the crime, 
5 do they? So I'm not going to mention that politician's name, because you didn't bring it 
6 up, but that's public record. 
7 So I think that there are two tiers of law in the United States now and that Ron 
8 Watkins and myself are not eligible for the higher tier of law, where you actually get help 
9 from law enforcement. That's what I think. 
10 Q Understood. 
11 And we talked a lot about President Trump throughout this deposition and your 
12 support for President Trump when you went to the 6th. Why did you think it was 
13 important to support President Trump? 
14 A Because he's the President of the goddamn United States of America! 
15 That's why. And he certainly was in January. 
16 Q Do you still believe he is President of the United States? 
17 A He was in January. That's what this is all about. Right now, the President 
18 is Joe Biden. 
19 
20 Q 
A Do you believe Joe Bide n's the duly elected President of the United States? 
No, but I believe that he is the President of the United States. He's sworn 
21 in. But I don't believe he was duly elected. I believe he was selected. 
22 
23 
24 
25 Q 
A 
Q 
A And I suppose I was wondering more about -­
But that's my opinion. 
--the reasons you supported -­
And my opinion's -- 1 
2 
3 
4 Q 
A 
Q 
A --President Trump. 
--not a crime, sir. 
Sorry, what? 
My opinion's not a crime. And supporting the President is not a crime 
5 either. In fact --
6 Q I don't think it is. 
7 A --that's patriotic. 
8 Q I don't think it is. I was just wondering why you supported President 
9 Trump. There were particular issues or reasons --124 
10 A Because he was the President of the United States. I'm an American. I've 
11 sworn an oath to the Constitution of the United States, and that oath doesn't expire, sir. 
12 
13 Q 
A Right. Obviously, all Americans are not --
I'm not a member of the Oath Keeper group or anything like that, but my 
14 oath doesn't expire. 
15 And you know what? Generally, even you --not "you" as in --not disparaging 
16 you in the least --but when you were in school, I'm sure --I don't think they do anymore, 
17 but when I was in school, up to a certain level, we had to memorize the Preamble of the 
18 Constitution, which talks about our obligations as Americans. And it has the word 
19 "obligation" in it, as a matter of fact. 
20 And the thing about it is, that Preamble to the Constitution is the closest thing to 
21 an oath that every American in the United States of America has to memorize. Now, 
22 they don't do that anymore, because they're rewriting our education system, but I made 
23 my kids memorize it. 
24 "We, the People, in order to form a more perfect Union" --you remember that 
25 one?  1 
2 Q 
A Of course. 
Did you have to learn that in school? Yeah. That is basically an oath as 
3 well. That's why they make you memorize it. 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 Q Understood. 
I'm just trying to rephrase my question. 
Thank you. 
I understand the idea of trying to support our system of government. 
Thank you. 
That is obviously different -­
That's what I do. 125 
10 
11 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Okay. Appreciate that, and appreciate that concept. I also know that's a 
12 different matter from wanting to support particular political figures. We can support 
13 our system of government without supporting the President, politically or ideologically. 
14 And so I was wondering, just for broader context on our end, if you would speak 
15 to your support for President Trump in that sense. What motivated you to support him, 
16 beyond, obviously, supporting our constitutional system? 
17 A Well, you know, he wasn't particularly good for my business or my family. 
18 So it wasn't for any personal reasons, other than he is good for our country as a whole. 
19 Look at the gas prices. The gas prices when he was President were quite low. 
20 When we stopped producing gas in America, then gas gets expensive, and I don't like 
21 that. Do you like that? No. Nobody likes that. Nobody likes paying $6 a gallon. 
22 $6.34 was the last I paid for a gallon of gas. Nobody likes that. 
23 Nobody likes printing massive amounts of money and huge inflation. I figured it 
24 out --I figured out the inflation that was coming to the United States of America over the 
25 next 3 years at devaluing the American dollar 91 percent. When they're done with this,  126 
1 we will at least be 91 percent devalued over the next 3 years. And that's unbearable for 
2 most people. 
3 Q Uh-huh. 
4 And so you mentioned a lot about what you saw the mood of January 6th as 
5 being --cheerful, patriotic, beautiful. 
6 A Yes, sir. 
7 Q And given all that we know now about the day, about what happened inside 
8 the Capitol that day, about the threats that Members of Congress and the peaceful 
9 transfer of power faced, do you still think that it was a beautiful, patriotic day? 
10 A Absolutely. I think that the people that caused trouble, the troublemakers 
11 that were there --obviously were there; they're in jail, right? --they were troublemakers, 
12 but on a graph they would be approaching zero, unless we made that a logarithmic graph 
13 so that you could actually see them. 
14 They are, for the amount of people that were there --and Congress knows how 
15 many people were there. They can figure that out. They're not dummies. They have 
16 access to that. They can see those aerial photographs and estimate the number of 
17 people. 
18 So, for that amount of people, it's approaching statistical zero, the amount of 
19 crime that was there that day. 
20 
21 Q Uh-huh. 
And we also talked a lot about, sort of, living in a time where the future is 
22 undetermined. And I'm wondering about how you view January 6th in the course of 
23 American history. 
24 A Well, time --time works --is interesting. You know, time --Einstein has his 
25 arrow of time, and most physicists follow that.  127 
1 There are more modern physicists that are backing away from the arrow of time, 
2 and they're looking at it more of like a causal set theory view of time, where time has 
3 multiple branches and can go multiple ways, which basically puts it into multiple 
4 dimensions of time, sir. 
5 Causal set theory is --maybe you've seen graphs where they have a point and an 
6 arrow going to another point and an arrow going to another point and where sometimes 
7 those points meet. This is called causal set theory. 
8 
9 
10 And, yeah, our future is undetermined. 
Q 
A So how do you view January 6th as --
The wave function has collapsed on January 6th. It's over, it's done, it's 
11 history, sir. It's observed. 
12 
13 
14 
15 Q 
A 
Q Okay. So no comment on the broader significance moving forward? 
The future is undetermined, 
Agreed. 
- Well, unless anyone has anything else, I think we can wrap up with a 
16 few closing remarks. Anyone else on the call? 
17 
18 Okay. 
And I just wanted to ask in closing, Mr. Watkins: We've received production 
19 from you, in your personal capacity and then also 8kun as an entity, and thank you for 
20 your cooperation. Can you confirm today that you've made a diligent effort to search 
21 for all documents responsive to the select committee's subpoena? 
22 
23 
24 The Witness. I did my best. 
Okay. 
The Witness. And I may have missed a few letters, but I --they don't exist 
25 anymore. They would've been tossed in the garbage or something.  128 
1 Well, we appreciate that. 
2 And what about internal messages about moderation decisions within 8kun, like 
3 chats between global volunteers? 
4 
5 
6 The Witness. I don't -­
- Are there any of those? 
The Witness. --keep any of that. I think they stay for maybe, like, a week or 
7 something. 
8 Okay. 
9 
10 
11 
12 The Witness. Nothing is preserved. 
Okay. 
And I know you also mentioned that you had taken video of January 6th -­
The Witness. That's --that's public. You can go to tora3.com. And on 
13 January 6th I had a livestream until I lost my internet connectivity. 
14 Okay. 
15 Well, Mr. Barr, I think if we could get links or some format --
16 
17 
18 
19 The Witness. I can look for that link, and I'll send it to you. 
Mr. Barr. For the video? 
The video and then also the removed --
The Witness. That would be more accurate than the documentary, which was a 
20 beautiful Hollywood production, but it's more of that than a documentary. The only 
21 thing documentarian around that is I didn't get paid for it. But the rest of it is Hollywood 
22 production. 
23 So I will look on 8kun for that --let's see --and I will give you the exact URL to my 
24 day there. And you can see where I was, right there at the --
25 Mr. Barr. Yeah. If you want to send it to me,■-- 129 
1 The Witness. I'll send it to my attorney, and he'll send it to --
2 Mr. Barr. Yeah. 
3 what I've got right now is that we need to produce for you the log link 
4 that details banned or deleted posts, the list of guidelines for deleting that he referenced, 
5 and the January 6th video that we just discussed. 
6 Yeah. A list of guidelines is the training document we discussed that 
7 the global volunteers get? 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 Mr. Barr. Yes. 
Okay. Great. Yeah, that was everything I had. 
And before I go off the record, I wanted to pause to see if --
The Witness. I have an hour and 30-some minutes of it too. So it's there. 
- Thank you. We'd appreciate receiving that. 
13 I wanted to give a final chance for my colleagues to offer anything else, but I don't 
14 see anyone offering anything else, so, Mr. Barr and-
15 [Audio interruption.] 
16 The Witness. I'm sorry. That was the video from whatever's live now. 
17 Well, did either of you want to make any closing remarks before we 
18 finish? 
19 The Witness. I want my letter to be put into the record, the one I sent this 
20 morning. 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 Yes. Well, it is an exhibit, so it will be --
The Witness. Do I need to read it, or you think that's not necessary? 
It's not necessary. 
Mr. Barr? 
Mr. Barr. No, I hope we were helpful and able to answer your questions here  130 
1 today. 
2 And, as I noted in our correspondence, we think there are some serious First 
3 Amendment issues with some of the questions, but because 8kun and Mr. Watkins didn't 
4 have responsive material, we could avoid any disputes over that. So hopefully the 
5 information you got today is helpful to --
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 The Witness. And I wasn't trying to be adversarial at all. 
Mr. Barr. No. 
The Witness. So, you know, I have some strong opinions, obviously. 
- We appreciate the time today. 
And, with that, we can go off the record at 1:55 p.m. 
[Whereupon, at 1:55 p.m., the deposition was concluded.]  1
