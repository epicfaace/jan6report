"Armed and Ready, Mr. President": Demonstrators Urged to Bring Guns, Prepare for Violence at January 6 
"stop the Steal" Protest in DC 
[Wewantthetotalwar] 
Following Twitter posts from President Trump rallying his supporters to attend an upcoming "stop the 
Steal" protest at the u.s National Mall the day Congress will meet to officially decide the 2020 
Presidential election, users on a pro-Trump online forum interpreted Trump's statements as call to take 
direct action: insisting they have finally received formal "permission" from the President to arm 
themselves for the "revolutionary" protest and to engage in political violence.

on December 19, 2020, a user began a thread on a prominent pro-Trump forum -where users have been known 
to promote violence and hate speech -containing a recent Tweet from President 
Trump<https://ent.siteintelgroup.com/Far-Right-/-Far-Left-Threat/as-congress-finalizes-election-far­
right-community-rallies-behind-trump-s-call-to-protest-election-fraud.html?acm=2693_26355> claiming it 
was "statistically impossible" for him to have lost the 2020 Election and thereby encouraging his 
followers to attend a "wild" upcoming "stop the Steal" protest in Washington D.C. on January 6. 
In addition to users on the ensuing thread organizing ride shares and lodging for the event, the post was 
met with an array of incitements from users who felt emboldened by the President's statement to take 
direct action at the event. Users not only threatened to attack left-wing protesters but also Democratic 
and Republic politicians and other government officials involved in the finalizing of the electoral 
college vote count. 
Multiple users targeted the Congressmen and women for intimidation, with one user encouraging 
participants to "be already in place when Congress tries to get to their meeting" and "make sure they know 
who to fear.· Another user similarly suggested that if "congress votes against the true will of the people  • and elects Joe Biden as President despite "all the evidence of fraud and corruption,· then the 
protesters should "start marching into the chambers.· 
Urging protesters to "go after the traitors directly," a user claimed that a military strategist gave 
them the advice to "have a list of their family members as well." 
Asserting that the right to bear arms was provided for ·exactly times like this,· another user spurred 
those participating at the January 6 event to ·exercise your 2nd amendment" if the Republican politicians 
refuse to support Trump's election fraud disputes. They also insisted anyone "scared" of doing so should· 
stay out of the way.· 
"Fuck [the Republican party] right back," wrote another user, urging Trump's supporters to "show up with 
guns and threaten them with death." 
In response to one user stating that they "don't condone violence· against politicians, a user retorted 
that "patriots" who are "still too cowardly to condone violence· are "part of the problem,· exclaiming the 
vi O l ence "NEEDS TO FUCKING HAPPEN.• 
A screenshot of the incitement follows:

When users inquired if Trump was in fact advocating for part1c1pants to attend the march armed when he 
published the Tweet promoting the protest, several users affirmed that they interpreted his statement as 
calling on his supporters to bring weapons. 
·r read that as armed," one user insisted, positing that if "everyone commits" to carrying weapons at the 
protest then "how can they stop us?" Another user suggested that if participants "aren't marching armed" 
then there is no "point" to marching at all. A user also claimed that when Trump made his statement he· 
knew what we will be bringing,· thereby echoing a call to action previously made by the President in 
regard to the Proud Boys: "stand back and stand by." 
Making reference to Trump's tweet asserting the event "will be wild," one user claimed Trump was implying 
the rally would be violent like the "wild West.· Another user insisted that Trump was thereby asking 
protest participants to "be wild," asserting that a supposedly violent insurrection by his supporters has 
"always been the plan.· 
"[Trump] can't exactly openly tell you to revolt. . .This is the closest he'll ever get,· the aforementioned 
user continued, receiving a response from a user declaring: "Then bring the guns we shall." A screenshot 
of the interaction follows: 
[Wild plan] 
Openly denouncing and disregarding the strict gun laws of Washington D.C., several users declared their 
intentions to bring firearms and other weapons to the march. "Armed and ready, Mr. President,· wrote one 
user, with another declaring they will "be open carrying and so will my friends.· The latter user also 
noted that Trump's supporters have just been ·waiting for Trump to say the word" and thereby proclaimed: • 
there is not enough cops in DC to stop what is coming.· These and other examples of users announcing they 
are bringing weapons to the protest can be seen in the screenshot below:

Moreover, users on the forum strongly urged those who plan on attending armed to do so in large groups in 
attempt to avoid being apprehended by law enforcement. One user also suggested going to the march "in 
numbers so heavy and so protected" that they are "able to arrest treasonous members of the government.· A 
user responded to the aforementioned comment opining that "this is what Trump expects,· underscoring that  the President's supporters can "not allow congress to certify a fraudulent election and get away with ... 
don't allow any government forces to intimidate us." 
"Numbers and organization will matter," another user commented, warning that "the lone wolf armed 
patriots" will be "picked off deep in the city" by law enforcement. 
Following several inquiries regarding the legality of open and concealed firearm carry in the u.s 
capital, users proposed that that participants of the protest should not have to abide by the law: 
claiming as justification that the "treasonous" Democratic party is responsible for committing numerous 
crimes:" such as "stealing the election," "betraying your country to a Chinese spy," "murdering the elderly 
in nursing homes," and "killing Ambassadors and Americans with proxy wars or drone strikes." One user 
thereby proclaimed, "[Democrats] did what they had to do now we gotta do the same." 
User "POS" posited that because Democrats have already allegedly "broken" the "Rule of Law," Trump's 
supporters must "fall back to the next level: the Rule of War." Notably, the aforementioned user concluded 
their statement with the phrase "Might makes Right," a popular creed among totalitarian regimes. 
"We need to follow the law while stopping a communist takeover?" remarked a user, with another baselessly 
maintaining that the Capital's firearm ban is "completely unconstitutional and therefore illegal." 
Acknowledging that bringing guns to the march is "definitely not legal," one user nonetheless encouraged 
others to "2A anyway." Similarly, another user suggested that protesters should disregard the legality of 
firearm carrying because "this is war and we're clearly in a post-legal phase of our society." 
Many users also drew on Revolutionary War language to incite violence at the event, with one user urging 
"Be there on the 6th ready for 1776" and another making the following incitement against Trump's 
opposition: 
This is taxation without representation. Im nothing special and I pay 50 g's a year in taxes and who it 
goes to hates me because I'm a white male. This is war and these blue haired pussies are about to get 
capped. 
Predicting and encouraging violent unrest at the rally, user "CR6" stated that they would be "shocked" if 
the pro-Trump protesters "just stand by waving a bunch of flags while they go right ahead and certify an 
illegitimate president." The user then proposed that the "goal" of the protest should be to make sure 
politicians known there "WILL be consequences" if President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated. CR6 asserted 
that the protest is a "historical opportunity" to "change the world," declaring that Trum~s supporters 
will not "accept a fraudulent election" and that the "DC Rats" -or government officials involved in 
deciding the election -will either "listen to [their] voices" or face "their own peril." 
Prophesying left-wing counter-protesters engaging in altercations at the protest, one user asked if 
"citizen's arrests" would be legal, to which another user responded: "don't arrest," instead advocating 
for "Citizens firing squad." 
"Shooting tyrants is the basis of the 2nd amendment," incited another user. 
Mai ntai ni ng that "peaceful action" is not an option, user "AN456" declared that they "do want violence" to 
ensue at the protest, positing: "You think a crowd of yelling peaceful protesters is going to actually 
change anything? ... If you can't find a use for violence, then In January, Biden will be your president." 
The aforementioned user further insisted that "people will get shot" at the protest. 
"Fun fact: no revolution has ever been won without violence," one user postulated, with another user 
insisting that Trump's supporters now have the opportunity to "kill the opposition." After a user 
responded to the latter comment cautioning that killing the opposition is "not a legal avenue" to secure 
the election for Trump, another user retorted, "when they are committing treason it is ... treason is 
punishable by death," with user "B2040" also thereby proclaiming: "I'm gonna do it anyway."  A screenshot of the incitement follows:
