Boris, 
I'm fine with all of Ken's edits. They had not come through to me on the last round. Here's the final. 
As for hearings, I think both are unnecessary. The fact that we have multiple slates of electors demonstrates the uncertainty 
of either. That should be enough. And I agree with Ken that Judiciary Committee hearings on the constitutiona lity of the 
Electoral Count Act could invite counter views that we do not believe should constrain Pence (or Grassley) in the exercise of 
power they have under the 12th Amendment. Better for them just to act boldly and be challenged , since the challenge would 
likely lead to the Court denying review on nonjusticiable political question grounds.
