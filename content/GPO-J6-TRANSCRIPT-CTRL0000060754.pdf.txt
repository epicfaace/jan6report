2 - Let's go on the record at 2:03 p.m. Good afternoon. This is a 3 
3 transcribed interview of Lawrence Stackhouse conducted by the House Select Committee 
4 to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol, pursuant to House 
5 Resolution 503. 
6 At this time, I would ask the witness to please state your full name and spell your 
7 last name for the record. 
8 Mr. Stackhouse. Lawrence Stackhouse, S-t-a-c-k-h-o-u-s-e. 
9 Thank you. This is a staff-led interview. I don't see any members 
10 on right now, but if they do join, they also may ask questions. So speaking is-
11 -investigative counsel. And with me in the room today is 
12 investigative counsel. So, at this time, could counsel please state your name for the 
13 record. 
14 
15 Ms. Akpan. Hello, my name is Ubong Akpan, spelled --last name is A-k-p-a-n. 
Thank you very much. There is an official reporter transcribing the 
16 record of this interview. Please wait until each question is completed before you begin 
17 your response, and we will try to wait until your response is complete before we ask our 
18 next question. The stenographer cannot record nonverbal responses, such as shaking 
19 your head, so it's important that you answer each question with an audible, verbal 
20 response. And, if I see you, you know, nodding yes or shaking your head no, I'll just 
21 repeat for the record and confirm that that's what indeed you meant to say. Now, we 
22 ask that you provide complete answers based on your best recollection. If the question 
23 is not clear, please ask for clarification. If you do not know the answer, just simply say 
24 so. 
25 And now I am going to go through a couple of other important things to note  4 
1 before we start. First, it's important that you understand that this interview is 
2 voluntary. If at any time you would like to stop speaking with us, that is your choice. 
3 Similarly, if at any point you need to discuss something with Ms. Akpan in private, please 
4 let us know, and we will take a break so you can have that conversation. 
5 Second, this interview is not under oath. But because this is formal 
6 congressional investigation, you're obligated under Federal law to tell the truth, the same 
7 as if you were speaking with the FBI or the Department of Justice. It is unlawful to 
8 deliberately provide false information to Congress. For this interview, providing false 
9 information could result in criminal penalties for false statements. 
10 Do you understand? 
11 
12 
13 Mr. Stackhouse. Yes. 
Thank you. 
Third, you are not obligated to keep the fact of this interview and what we discuss 
14 confidential. You are free to tell whomever you wish that you met with us, including the 
15 prosecutor or judge on your case, or you can tell no one at all. That is entirely up to you. 
16 Fourth, the select committee is separate and independent from the Department 
17 of Justice. We have no involvement with the prosecutions, and DOJ is not a partner 
18 with the select committee in this investigation. The select committee also is not a party 
19 to your criminal case and is not agreeing to submit anything on your behalf to the judge, 
20 nor can we make any representation whether you tell the judge you have met with us 
21 that the judge will be more favorable to you during sentencing. 
22 Fifth, we have agreed with Ms. Akpan not to share the substance of what you say 
23 with the Department of Justice prior to your sentencing, but there are two possible 
24 exceptions to this. If you told us about evidence of a crime that we thought law 
25 enforcement was unaware of or if had we had any reason to believe that you lied during  1 this interview, then we would be obligated to tell the Department of Justice or another 
2 appropriate law enforcement about that. But if you tell the judge that you met with us, 
3 please understand that may prompt questions from the judge about what you said and 
4 whether it is consistent with your prior statements and acceptance of responsibility. 
5 And if the judge starts asking questions of us, we may get --we may have to respond and 
6 divulge what you said. 
7 So does that all make sense, Mr. Stackhouse? 
8 
9 Mr. Stackhouse. Yes. 
Thank you. And, like I said, if you need a break for some reason or 
10 for whatever reason you would like to discuss something with Ms. Akpan privately, let us 
11 know, we are happy to accommodate, take a break, and give you that opportunity. 
12 And may pop in. And if he and I are asking questions at the same 
13 time, please let us know so that we stop doing that, and I'll clarify the question for you. 
Mr. Stackhouse. Okay. 
Great.

Q All right. Let's start with a little bit of background --a little bit about your 
19 background. How old are you, Mr. Stackhouse? 
20 A 34 years old. 
21 Q And where do you currently live? 
22 A I live in West Deptford, New Jersey. 
23 Q And how long have you lived there? 
24 A Eight months. 
25 Q Did you grow up in New Jersey? 5  1

A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q I grew up in Pennsylvania. 
Okay. So not too far away. How long have you lived in New Jersey? 
I have lived in New Jersey for 4 years. 
Got it. Now, what is your educational background? 
Some college. And I have a certificate in sheet metal. 
Okay. And what do you do now for a living? 
I build aircraft for Brenner Aerostructures. 
And that's in New Jersey? 
That is Bensalem, Pennsylvania. 
Okay. Great. Is that your only job or any others? 
I DoorDash here and there for extra money on the side. 
Got it. Thank you. Now, we're going to talk a little bit about the time 
13 period leading up to January 6th. And a lot of these questions at first are actually going 
14 to be from President Trump's election in 2016 until the 2020 election. So, just to orient 
15 your mind, think about that timeframe, but not yet after the election. So, after 
16 President Trump got elected in 2016, how would you describe how involved in politics 
17 you were? 
18 A Right then and there, that's when I started to get involved in politics. 6 
19 When he got in office, I started taking more of an interest. Obviously, I was going along, 
20 and I just followed certain social medias. 
21 Q Did you follow President Trump on social media, or are you talking about like 
22 news organizations on social media? 
23 A Yes, I followed --yeah, well, I would --
24 Yeah, can we pause the record for a second until we get Mr. 
25 Stackhouse back.  1 
2 
3 [Discussion off the record.] 
BY 
Q Okay. Great. Let's go back --well, we'll go back on the record right now 
4 at 2:11. And I just asked Mr. Stackhouse whether he was following President Trump or 
5 other news organizations on social media, and his answer got interrupted by technical 
6 difficulties. So, Mr. Stackhouse, do you want to go back to that answer? 
7 A Yes, I started following President Trump when he took office. 
8 Q And what other things were you seeing on social media? Was it like news, 
9 any news organizations? 
10 A Back then, it wasn't too much really because he was just getting --he was 
11 just starting --he was just starting to get involved. 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 - Yes. Let's pause for a minute. 
[Discussion off the record.] 
[Discussion off the record.] 
BY-: 
Q We'll go back on the record at 2:17 p.m. And just to reorient ourselves 
17 because we were having some technical difficulties here, Mr. Stackhouse you had 
18 mentioned that you were following President Trump on social media following the 2016 
19 election. And then I think things got a little cut off. So which social media accounts 7 
20 were you following, or sorry, which social media sets were you following President Trump 
21 on? 
22 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A 
Q At that time, I just seen it on Facebook. 
Great. And did you follow political news on Facebook for any other sites? 
Not then, no. 
Okay. So you didn't like look at The Wall Street Journal or The New York  8 
1 Times or The Washington Post? 
A No, I wasn't that interested. 
Q Okay. Did you watch news on TV around then? 2 
3 
4 A At that time, whatever was on. I didn't look forward to politics or anything. 
5 I just watched whatever was on TV. 
6 Q Okay. I'm going to ask some about other social media sites, and we will run 
7 through a list, and you can say like, yes or no, whether you used them at that time or 
8 have heard of them. So --
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 A At that time? 
Q Yes, yes, at that time. We'll get to the other time in a little bit. So Parler? 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A No, I don't think that was around then. 
Reddit? 
I heard of it. 
But you didn't use it? 
No. 
Q Got it. Telegram? 
A No. 
Q Twitter? 
A No. I heard of it, but I didn't use any of them. 
Q Got. Something called GETTR, G-E-T-T-R? 
A No, I never heard of that. 
Q All right. And then a couple of these are --so now I want to ask you about 
23 whether you used the social media sets following the election, something called The 
24 Donald.win? 
25 A No.  9 
Q Gab? 
A No. 
Q Wimkin, W-i-m-k-i-n? 
A No. 1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 Q And did you use any of the ones I mentioned earlier after the 2020 election? 
10 
11 A Yes. 
Q But which ones? 
A Parler. 
Q Okay. Did you follow --
A Telegram too, yeah. 
Q Okay. Parler and Telegram? And did you pay attention to political news 
12 on Parler or Telegram? 
13 A Parler got shout down pretty quick, and Telegram was just more of like --it 
14 was a group chat thing; people would just upload chats. 
15 Q Right. Did you rely on those chats or anything on Parler for political 
16 information? 
17 A I will check here and there. I never really did rely on them. I found them 
18 interesting, but I didn't rely on it. 
19 Q Were you part of like particular groups on --well, let's stick with Parler? 
20 Did you like follow particular groups on Parler? 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 A Yeah, I think it was just like Trump 2020. 
Q Was that a hash --sort of like a hashtag --
A Yeah. 
Q --kind of group? 
A Yeah.  10 
1 Q Okay. Do you remember the kind of posts that were in Trump 2020 on 
2 Parler? 
3 A I got --all positive things are going --all of those rallies. Just wherever he 
4 has been, his crowds, the miles of lines to get into his rallies. It was just things like that. 
5 Q Understood. And, on Telegram, were you talking with people about 
6 politics? 
7 
8 A I couldn't get anyone on there, no. I just read the threads. 
Q Okay. Do you remember threads that you specifically paid attention to for 
9 political --
10 A I have no idea. I really --I wasn't into it that much. Whatever was there, I 
11 just clicked on. It wasn't really that big to me. 
12 Q Understood. And, following the 2020 election, did you still use Facebook to 
13 pay attention to politics? 
14 
15 
16 A No. I deleted Facebook, 2018. 
Q Okay. So were you following President Trump on any other social media? 
A I was --I was on lnstagram and Parler. And then once everything 
17 happened, I got rid of everything. 
18 
19 
20 Q When you say "once everything happened," do you mean January 6th? 
A Yes. 
Q Okay. So, in the time period between 2020 election and January 6th, were 
21 you following President Trump on lnstagram or other social media accounts? 
22 
23 
24 
25 A Yes, lnstagram, Twitter, those things. 
Q So you did have a Twitter at that time? 
A Yes. 
Q Did you get a lot of political news from Twitter?  1 
2 A 
Q The same stuff everywhere. Nothing new. 
Understood. So, right after the 2020 election, did you believe that it was 
3 stolen from former President Trump? 
4 
5 
6 A Yes. 
Q Do you remember when you started to believe that? 
A When I started seeing all these mail-in ballots come in days later, and then 11 
7 things weren't making sense in Philadelphia with people like not allowing people to view 
8 the election and stuff like that. Things weren't adding up. So then I thought, yes, it 
9 was stolen. 
10 Q Do you remember if you had heard anything about election fraud before the 
11 2020 election? 
12 
13 A Yes. About --just a --mail-in ballots, in general. 
Q Okay. Was that the first time you had thought about mail-in ballots and 
14 election fraud? 
15 
16 
17 
18 A Yes. 
Q Did you ever use a mail-in ballot? 
A No. 
Q Was there anything else about the 2020 election that you found helped your 
19 belief that the election was stolen? 
20 A Because everything that I was seeing on the news, I mean, regular and 
21 locally in Philadelphia. There was people in Philadelphia that were not allowing people 
22 to view the elections. If you were wearing Trump shirts, they were not letting you vote. 
23 And I feared that was some kind of form of cheating. 
24 
25 Q Where were you seen that reporting? 
A All over Philadelphia. It happened in person. It happened in [inaudible].  1 It happens to a couple of friends of mine. So it was just, it made sense to me. If you 
2 were wearing Trump stuff to go up to the voting polls --
3 
4 
5 Q 
A 
Q I'm sorry. Did you just cut out, Mr. Stackhouse? 
Oh, yeah. That's --yes, I did believe it was stolen. Can you hear me? 
Now we can hear you. I think you got cut off when you said --I asked 12 
6 where you had seen that reporting, and you were answering about, all over Philadelphia. 
7 A Yes, it was also on the news in Philadelphia. And it happened to people 
8 that I have actually known who live in Philadelphia who went to south Philly, who went to 
9 voting polls, who were basically turned away by the place for wearing a Trump 2020 shirt. 
10 
11 Q Okay--
A So I just added things up in my head. Again, I mean, it doesn't make 
12 sense --it's not right. It doesn't make sense. 
13 Q Okay. Thank you. We'll both do better not to make sure that we're not 
14 talking over each other. So, Mr. Stackhouse, you said that you received news reporting 
15 about this. Are you talking about local news? 
16 
17 A It was on Fox. Fox Philly. 
Q Okay. It was on Fox Philly. Were you also seeing reports like that on 
18 social media? 
19 
20 A Yeah. 
Q Okay. Did you ever see reporting that, in fact, the Philadelphia --the 
21 election counting apparatus in Philadelphia had a livestream video that anybody could 
22 watch? 
23 
24 
25 A Oh, yeah. 
Q So did that matter to you? 
A There were a lot of livestream videos that people went up to the --they  1 went up to voting polls themselves and were turned away. Those kind of livestreamed 
2 videos? 
3 Q No. Sorry if my question wasn't clear. So the actual government entity 
4 that counts the votes had a camera livestreaming the process. Did you ever see 
5 reporting about that? 
6 
7 A No. 
Q Okay. Thank you. So, given that you had believed the election was 
8 stolen, did you participate in any activities following the 2020 election related to like 
9 alleged voter fraud? 13 
10 A No, I just looked into it. And, after it happened, it happened. There was 
11 nothing I could really do about it. It is what it is. 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 Q So you didn't attend any rallies before January 6th about election fraud? 
A No. 
Q So, just for the record, you were not in D.C. for the November 14th rally? 
A I was not. 
Q And the same question for December 12th, 2020? 
A I was not. 
Q Okay. Did you ever make any political donations to groups or entities that 
19 were challenging election issues between the 2020 election and January 6th? 
20 
21 A No. 
Q Thank you. Did you go to any other rallies in that time sphere --sorry, time 
22 period, maybe like COVID lockdowns? 
23 
24 
25 A In 2020? 
Q Yes. 
A No, I --the only rally I went to was January 6th.  14 
1 Q Okay. Thank you. So now we're going to move on to talk about why you 
2 decided to go to Washington, D.C., for the January 6th rally. So was there anything else 
3 besides election fraud --sorry. I don't want to presume. Was election fraud the 
4 reason why you decided to go to Washington, D.C., on January 6th? 
5 A Well, part of it. The main reason was because usually his rallies are very 
6 fun, very upbeating, very --just bands everywhere playing. Everyone loves everyone. 
7 Everyone is very friendly. I have been to other rallies that he has had, and there is never 
8 any problems. It's just everybody loving everyone. So that's why I went. 
9 Q Okay. So did President Trump say anything that influenced your decision to 
10 go on January 6th? 
11 A No, no. I thought maybe --I thought it was going to be his last rally. And I 
12 thought it would be just nice to attend. 
13 Q How did you learn about the rally? 
14 A 
15 big secret. 
16 
17 Q 
A I don't know --I think word of mouth and social media. I mean it wasn't a 
Right. Right. Was it Twitter, Parler, Telegram? 
Not, it was not Twitter. Maybe people just sending me links I have seen on 
18 lnstagram. I can't really --I can't really --I just knew about it. It was all over the news. 
19 It wasn't --and once I heard about it, I said, okay, yeah, I'll go. 
20 Q So do you remember a tweet from President Trump on December 19th that 
21 called on people to come to Washington, D.C. on January 6th and mentioned that it 
22 would be a wild protest? 
23 
24 A 
Q My Twitter was not active on December 19th. 
Okay. And did you see anyone then get other social media, you know, 
25 repost that tweet or something like it?  15 
1 A No, I just seen screenshots on the whole rally itself. That would be 
2 people's stories of the dates and times, stuff like that. Just where food vendors would 
3 be, stuff like that. 
Q Were these screenshots like busses and inviting invited people to D.C.? 
A No, they were just like pretty much like a rally ticket, like a flyer. 
Q Okay. Do you remember what the flyer said? 4 
5 
6 
7 A Stop the steal rally, Washington Monument, MAGA Millions March, stuff like 
8 that. I can't really remember. 
9 Q That's okay. Thank you. Do you remember when you first decided to 
10 travel to Washington, D.C. for the January 6th rally? 
11 A When I first heard about it because I figured it would be his last one. 
12 figured it would be. 
13 
14 
15 Q 
A 
Q Do you remember like a specific date or time? 
Around December. I don't remember. 
I think you broke up there a little bit. I think you were saying, you said 
16 some time in December? 
17 A Yeah, that is all I can remember. It wasn't, like I said, it wasn't a real, real, 
18 big deal of mine. And like I wasn't like --I wasn't so thrilled to go because it was the 
19 middle of December, but at that time, I told someone that he could come down. So we 
20 just --we set a date, made plans, and just went. 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 Q Who was the person you decided to go with? 
A At that time, it was my ex-girlfriend's younger brother. 
Q And what was his name? 
A Scott. 
Q I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 A Scott. 
Q Scott. Okay. 
A He has never been to a rally --yes. 
Q Did Scott end up going with you to Washington, D.C.? 
A Yes, he went down, but he did not go in. 
Q Understood. Did you plan on traveling with anybody else? 
A My friend Rachel, who was also arrested already. 
Q And any --how do you know Rachel? 
A Just a friend from around here. 
Q And is this Rachel Myers? 
A Yes. 
Q Did she give you a reason why she wanted to be in Washington, D.C., on 
13 January 6th? 
A I don't think she's ever been to a rally either. 16 
14 
15 
16 
17 Q So what prompted her to go to this rally instead of, you know, earlier rallies? 
A I think because maybe we realized it was going to be his last one. 
Q Okay. Did you attend the rally with Michael Gia nos, if I'm pronouncing his 
18 last name right? 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q He was down there, yes, but we did not go down there with him. 
did you have a question? 
Okay. So how do you know Mr. Gianos? 
A I know him from just around the way. He is more of her friend. 
Q So you knew him through Rachel? 
A Yeah. He is more of an acquaintance to me, not a friend. 
Q Got it. Did he give you a reason for why he wanted to be in D.C. on  17 
1 January 6th? 
2 A I am guessing the same reason. I mean, like I said, I don't really talk to him 
3 that much. I know he went --he went --he goes to a lot more rallies than I have. So 
4 he attends a lot of rallies. 
5 
6 
7 
8 Q 
A 
Q 
A Okay. So --
So like him going is not a surprise to me. 
Did you all talk before heading up to Washington, D.C.? 
I'm sure, yeah. I am sure we communicated. He kind of--we gave each 
9 our times when we were arriving, stuff like that, where we were staying. 
10 Q Understood. Was there any other reason that y'all wanted to be in 
11 Washington, D.C., on January 6th? 
12 
13 A 
Q No. 
Okay. Well, I'm going to read from some text messages that you had with 
14 Mr. Gia nos. These are from Mr. Gia nos' complaint that was filed in his case. So this is 
15 not filed in your case. But they say that Mr. Gia nos says: Well, I got a hotel. 
16 And you respond: You want to fight so bad. 
17 He responds: Night before too. 
18 So why did you --
19 
20 A 
Q Oh, because --
Please let me finish the question. Sorry. Why do you assume that Mr. 
21 Gia nos wanted to fight? 
22 A Because he --like I said, he went to rallies beforehand, and he was there in 
23 December. And, last time he was in December, he was jumped. 
24 
25 Q 
A Okay. So he was expecting violence on January 6th? 
Yeah, he was. He knows different people than I know, yeah.  18 
1 Q Okay. Did you take that as a reason that he wanted to be there on 
2 January 6th? Did we lose you Mr. Stackhouse? I think we lost you for --
3 A Hello? 
4 Q All right. We can hear you now. Sorry. I asked, did you take Mr. Gia nos 
5 wanting to fight as a reason that he wanted to be in Washington, D.C., on January 6th? 
6 A No, I think he would have went either way. Like I said, he goes to a lot of 
7 them. 
8 Q I understand that he had other reasons for going, but did you take fighting as 
9 one of reasons that he wanted to go? 
10 A I do not think that was his main priority, no. I think it was --he was 
11 just --he was a lot of talk, if you have ever like been around him. 
12 Q All right. I was not asking whether it was his main priority. I am just 
13 asking if you thought one of the reasons that he went to D.C. was to fight. I think we 
14 might have lost Mr. Stackhouse again. Let's pause the record at 2:35 p.m. I am trying 
15 to figure out this technical difficulty. 
16 [Discussion off the record.]

18 Q So let's get back on the record at 2:36 p.m., and, Mr. Stackhouse, before the 
19 technical difficulties, I had asked you whether you thought it was one of Mr. Gia nos' 
20 reasons for attending January 6th that he wanted to fight so badly? 
21 
22 
23 A No, I do not believe that was one of his reasons. 
Q Can you explain then why you said "you want to fight so bad"? 
A I was being sarcastic because of what he had told me. I was joking about it. 
24 He wanted to go down just to go down. He wasn't going down --I don't think he was 
25 going down to fight people, but I didn't go with him. So he was meeting up with  19 
1 different people. 
2 Q Okay. Did Mr. Gia nos' experience at earlier rallies make you worry about 
3 violence on January 6th? 
4 A Make we worry about it? Yes. I mean, I have seen it before too at other 
5 rallies. So I do know what he was talking about. 
6 Q Had you seen that on like news reports or --
7 A I have seen it in person. 
8 Q Do you remember which rallies? 
9 A Wildwood, and the Wildwood rally in New Jersey. 
10 Q That was before the 2020 election? 
11 A That was 2017, I think, or 2018 maybe. 
12 Q And what did you see? I think we lost you again, Mr. Stackhouse. Let's 
13 pause the record again at 2:38. 
14 [Discussion off the record.] 
15 BY-: 
16 Q We will go back on the record at 2:44 p.m., and before the technical 
17 difficulties, I believe I had asked --so I am just going to ask again whether you took Mr. 
18 Gianos' desire to fight as one of his reasons to attend January 6th? 
19 
20 
21 
22 A 
Q 
A 
Q No. 
Not at all? 
No. 
Right. Okay. Thank you. I had asked you about you had seen violence 
23 on a Wildwood, New Jersey, protest. And I think I asked you to describe that before we 
24 got cut off. So if you would describe that, please. 
25 A Down there, when you would be walking away from other rallies would be,  20 
1 you would have antifa members and BLM all over the place, and they would be throwing 
2 stuff at you. My friends' car that I went down with actually had spray paint BLM all over 
3 it. Antifa was throwing at, I guess, balloons of pee or something at us. 
4 Q So it was antifa and BLM that you take as causing this violence. Did that 
5 theme stick with you through 2020 where you were expecting antifa and BLM to show up 
6 at the January 6th rally? 
7 A I feared they were there --I thought they would be there. They're at every 
8 rally. I mean, they were there. 
9 
10 
11 Q Okay. 
A They were down there, yeah. 
Q Where were you getting --I am sorry, Mr. Stackhouse. Where were you 
12 getting any information that BLM or antifa would be at the January 6th rally? 
13 
14 
15 A 
Q 
A From the BLM Facebook site. From BLM site. It's all over it. 
Did you follow --do you follow those specific sites? 
No, I was --other people would just show me stuff from the group. I didn't 
16 have Facebook book then. 
17 
18 Q 
A Right. So people --
But that's not a reason. They're everywhere because they're at everything. 
19 So that is not reason that anyone would go down there. You avoid them. 
20 Q I'm sorry. So it's not a reason to go. You wanted to avoid them, but you 
21 still went. So were you expecting them to be there? 
22 A Oh, yeah, they're at every rally. 
23 Q Okay. And what did you expect to happen because they were there at a 
24 Trump rally? 
25 A Nothing. They just like --I will go about my way and mind my business.  21 
1 Q You just stated something to the effect of BLM and antifa would be a reason 
2 not to go to a rally. You expected them to still be at the --
3 
4 A 
Q I never said they would not. I never said that would be a reason not to go. 
Okay. Maybe I misheard you, but either way. So you are getting 
5 information through posts --other people's posts on social media about BLM and antifa. 
6 Is that correct? 
7 
8 
9 A 
Q 
A Yes. 
Do you remember, specifically, like which groups were posting about this? 
No, I didn't really care about it too much because I was used to it because 
10 they're everywhere. They're not really --I didn't really care. That was not why I was 
11 going. 
12 Q Even if it wasn't why you were going, was it something that was on your 
13 mind before January 6th? 
14 A I mean, I guess it is always on your mind if you're going to be there. I really 
15 don't --like I said, I really like didn't care. 
16 Q Let's just talk generally a little bit. How are you getting most of your 
17 information about January 6th? 
18 A Through posts, I guess. I don't know. I mean, you the flyer once, so that's 
19 all I need to see. I just needed a date and a time. I wasn't looking into it. I think you 
20 are thinking too much into it. I wasn't like looking into it. I wasn't obsessed with it. 
21 Like I said, I seen the flyer and said, okay, we'll go, and that's how I went. 
22 
23 Q 
A 
24 That's it. 
25 Q Yeah, but what were you doing to plan for January 6th? 
I bought warm clothes because it was going to be cold. Rachel got a room. 
Well, I want to read to you from some text messages on December 30th put  22 
1 between yourself and, I think, Ms. Myers, according to the complaint filed for Ms. Myers 
2 and Mr. Gianos. So, according to this complaint on December 30th, Ms. Myers says: 
3 I'm not scared of those little faggots, and if I died, it would be something I was so 
4 passionate for. So whatever, LOL. 
5 You said: You are not dying, Rach. 
6 And then, some --and a few, like skip some text messages, Ms. Myers said: 
7 Those twerps have weapons because they can't fight. 
8 
9 And you said: I'll give you a knife. 
And someone else mentioned a lot of bear mace. And I'll represent to you that 
10 "those twerps" seem to be a discussion of counterprotesters at January 6th. So were 
11 you planning --
12 
13 A 
Q It was large --
Let me finish the question. Were you planning to interact with or see any 
14 protesters on January 6th? 
15 A I was not planning on interacting with anybody. I mean, she's a girl, if she 
16 is scared, then get her protection, but she had no reason to be scared. And we didn't 
17 bring any weapons. That's not why we were going. Because the protesters were not 
18 near the monument. They were near Black Lives Matter Plaza, which was not near us. 
19 So what we did was we tried to avoid that area. [Inaudible.] She had a right to be 
20 scared. 
21 Q So Ms. Myers --I'll read the last text from Ms. Myers: I'll be marching with 
22 the PBs --which I'll represent to you means Proud Boys --so they stay away from me. 
23 Do you think Ms. Myers was scared? 
24 
25 A 
Q Yes. 
Okay. And why did you think she would need a knife?  23 
1 A For protection. I've been to rallies where I've seen physical fights; I've seen 
2 women get harassed. I've seen it. But the best thing to do is --to do is to avoid those 
3 situations. 
4 
5 Q , do you have a followup? No. 
All right. You just mentioned that Ms. Myers did not have a reason to be afraid. 
6 Was that your belief at the time. 
7 A Yeah, she shouldn't have to be afraid because everyone been down 
8 there --she's never been to a rally. So when you get down there, you see how 
9 everybody loved like one another. You had no reason to be afraid. 
10 
11 
12 BY 
Q I do have a question, 
I guess this is just not the adding up, Mr. Stackhouse. It's not. So what were 
13 you expecting as you were mentally preparing to come to the rally on January 6th? 
14 A I told you. You need to go down there. You attend the rally. You walk 
15 around, and that's it. 
16 
17 Q 
A So why didn't you say that to Ms. Myers? 
Because if you get harassed, you are going to have to protect yourself. 
18 mean, it's common sense, and at these rallies, people do get harassed. I've seen it. It 
19 happens in Philadelphia. It happens at rallies. It happens at every rally. 
20 Q I guess that's my question then, were you expecting to be harassed on 
21 January 6th? 
A No, I wasn't expecting it, but it's always a possibility. 
BY-: 
Q Is that it, ? Thank you. 22 
23 
24 
25 So let's move on to when you got to D.C., Do you remember what day you arrived  1 in Washington, D.C.? 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 A Yeah, January 6th. 
Q Okay. And how did you travel there? 
A A car. 
Q Did you stay in Washington, D.C., anywhere, or did you leave that day? 
A We stayed at a hotel. 
Q Was it in the District or somewhere around there? 
A Yeah. It was about, like a 20-minute walk or something. 
Q Okay. Do you remember what you were wearing that day? 
A Yeah, I had a Proud Boys Trump shirt on. 
Q What is a Proud Boys Trump shirt? 
A It just said "Proud Boys" on it, and it said "Trump 45" on the back of it. 
Q Okay. Thank you. And why did you have a Proud Boys sweatshirt on? 
A To feel protected. And it wasn't just a --it was just a shirt from a Trump 
15 website. It was red, white, and blue. It was a nice shirt. 
16 Q I'm sorry. Did the shirt --let me ask then, you had a Trump shirt on and a 
17 Proud Boys sweatshirt over it, or was it the same thing? 24 
18 A No, it was all one shirt. There was no sweatshirt. There was just a Proud 
19 Boys shirt with Trump on it. It was from the Trump website. 
20 Q Are you saying that you bought a Proud Boys sweatshirt from a Trump 
21 website? 
22 
23 A It was a T-shirt. It wasn't a sweatshirt. 
Q All right. Sorry. You bought a T-shirt that said "Proud Boys" on it from a 
24 Trump website? 
25 A Yes.  1 
2 
3 Q Okay. Were you a member of the Proud Boys? 
A No. 
Q Why did you think wearing a shirt that said "Proud Boys" on it would help 
4 protect you that day? 
5 A Because in case anything happens. You see them all over the place 
6 harassing people. Like, in Philadelphia, if you watch on the news, people are trying to 
7 take down statues. And then people are getting jumped. I mean, when people are 
8 getting jumped --I mean, people are getting jumped for COVID --for there --for being 25 
9 Asian over COVID. The Proud Boys are there to protect them. That's --and you see it. 
10 You see it on local news. It was just a nice shirt. It was red, white, and blue, Trump 45, 
11 it was black. That's why I wore it. 
12 Q So were you a member of the Proud Boys? 
13 A No. 
14 Q Were you ever in contact with any Proud Boys? 
15 A No. 
16 Q Did you ever get into a Signal chat with any Proud Boys? 
17 A No. 
18 Q Any Telegram chat with Proud Boys? 
19 A No. 
20 Q How about Parler chats? 
21 A No. 
22 
23 
24 Q 
Q BY 
I just have to take a step back, Mr. Stackhouse. So, of all the shirts in the 
25 world you could have purchased, you purchased the Proud Boys shirt. So just help us  26 
1 understand why that was your shirt of choice? 
2 A I mean, it was a nice shirt. It had red, white, and blue over it. I guess, at 
3 that time, I didn't understand how violent they were. I mean, it was just a shirt from his 
4 website. And I mean --
5 Q I'm going to stop you there. You mentioned when you were talking about 
6 the Proud Boys, you mentioned --and I have no idea where this came from --but statues 
7 being taken down in Philly. So the Proud Boys --
8 
9 A 
Q Yes. 
--doing in Philly as statues were being taken down? 
10 A They were protecting the statues. They were protecting the violence. 
11 There was a lot fights going on in Philadelphia around stuff [inaudible] at the time. And I 
12 guess the Proud Boys were all in there protecting the statues. They were protecting the 
13 people who were getting jumped by people who were trying to take the statues down. 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 them. 
19 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q You said the Proud Boys were protecting people. How are they doing it? 
By standing in the way. By not letting them get through --
They were fighting back, right? 
No, they were not. They were standing there, and the cops stood next to 
So the Proud Boys --as you're just saying, the Proud Boys were involved in 
20 violence in Philadelphia, and you were aware of it, but yet you also just said to us that you 
21 were not aware that the Proud Boys were --
22 
23 A 
Q There weren't about the violence --
--Mr.Stackhouse, let me finish. But then you also said that you weren't 
24 aware that Proud Boys were involved in violence. So those two statements just --
25 A At that time. At that time.  27 
1 Mr. Stackhouse, you need to let inish his question 
2 before you answer, please. Thank you. 
BY 3 
4 A Well, you're trying to make a statement that I'm lying, and I'm not. I think 
5 you're trying to put words in my mouth. 
6 Q I'm not saying you're lying, but what I'm trying to understand, though, is that 
7 you made a comment you didn't know the Proud Boys were involved in violence and I 
8 just --
9 Ms. Akpan. Can I --I am sorry. Can I just get a --can I get a 2-minute or 
10 5-minute break and talk to Mr. Stackhouse? 
11 Yes, please. Sure, Ms. Akpan. That's fine. And we can go 
12 back on the record at, what, 3:05 work for you? 
13 
14 
15 Ms. Akpan. Yes, thank you. 
Okay. Thank you, Ms. Akpan. 
[Recess.]  28 
1 
2 [3:09 p.m.] 
- So I guess with that, we can go back on the record at 3:09. And I 
believe , did you --you were in the middle of a question. 3 
4 
5 Yeah, I guess, and look, we were talking about the Proud Boys and 
6 how you wound up wearing a Proud Boys shirt. And I guess what we're trying to 
7 understand, and the way I think about it in my head is, like, look, either you were wearing 
8 the Proud Boys shirt, in some ways to try to create the identity of whatever the Proud 
9 Boys represented to you or you were a member of the Proud Boys. 
10 That's all I'm trying to understand, is, like, why you were wearing a Proud Boys 
11 shirt on January 6th. 
12 Mr. Stackhouse. Okay. At first I bought the shirt, like, I did think it was nice. 
13 liked the shirt in general. When I wore the shirt down there, I kind of myself affiliated 
14 the Proud Boys of like --being like a positive group, because when I would see them, and 
15 like I said, in Philadelphia, they would be standing with the police, like, side by side. So I 
16 figured them as a positive group. 
17 Okay. 
18 Mr. Stackhouse, you might've moved away from the phone a little bit 
19 there. 
20 
21 Mr. Stackhouse. Hello? 
Ms. Akpan. I think, Mr. Stackhouse, you were saying you had identified them as 
22 a positive group? 
23 Mr. Stackhouse. Yes. Because when I would see them on the local news, they 
24 would be standing with the Philadelphia Police, guarding those statues. So, like, I never 
25 really thought about it as wearing something bad or gang-affiliated, nothing like that.  1 wore the shirt because I --I just initially liked the shirt. 
2 
3 Got it. Okay. 
Mr. Stackhouse. I --I didn't want to feel like I was a part of the Proud Boys. 
4 I --I found them to be, like, a positive group around Philadelphia when a lot of things 
5 were kind of up in the air around here. 
Okay. Thank you. 29 
6 
7 
8 Ms. Akpan. And I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm not trying to take control of the meeting 
here, and I think it might be helpful to go back to the question 
9 about the Proud Boys and what he saw in Philadelphia. I think that informs this last 
10 answer that he gave here. 
11 I think it might've been around, you said, there were 
12 disagreements about the statutes in Philadelphia where you saw the Proud Boys. And I 
13 believe you even, I don't know, we can't read back the record, but I think you used the 
14 word protection. So please provide any type of color that will help us. 
15 Mr. Stackhouse. When I would see that stuff on the news, they would be 
16 standing there in large groups, protecting the citizens of Philadelphia, who were, like, 
17 elderly, the small, who were there for their statue. They would just be there, standing 
18 there protecting the group. 
19 But they would be standing with the police against all these other people trying to 
20 take it down, trying to set it on fire, and stuff like that. That's what I mean, like, they 
21 were standing with the police, and I just --I looked at them as a positive group at the 
22 time. 
23 BY-: 
24 Q Okay. Understood. So but why specifically wear that shirt on 
25 January 6th?  30 
1 A Honestly, I do not know. I --I just like --I honestly I like the shirt. I like 
2 the way it fit. I mean, I know it sounds stupid, but that is the reason why, I liked the way 
3 it fit. 
4 
5 Q Okay. And were Mr. Gianos or Ms. Myers affiliated with the Proud Boys? 
A Rachel is not. I know the kid Michael does have some kind of connection 
6 with some of them or talk to some of them, I don't know. But like I said, I did not know 
7 him that well. 
8 Q Understood. And do you know why Ms. Myers said she would be marching 
9 with Proud Boys on January 6th? 
10 A She --she just likes to talk. I have no idea why. To my recollection, I do 
11 not know of her knowing any Proud Boys. 
12 Q Understood. So on January 6th, did you meet up with Ms. Myers and 
13 Mr. Gianos? 
14 A I went down with Rachel, and then we met up with Mike --Mike earlier 
15 before we went over. 
16 
17 Q 
A Before you went over to the rally at the Ellipse? 
The rally, yes. And then when we got there, I'd say maybe 15, 20 minutes, 
18 we kind of all got separated. 
19 
20 
21 Q Okay. But while you were all at the rally, did you listen to all the speeches? 
A Yes. 
Q Okay. Were you there --were you particularly excited to hear any one of 
22 them speak? 
23 A No. I just --I just like hearing what most of them had to say usually, but at 
24 this time in the rally, you couldn't really hear that much. It was very unclear. 
25 Q Okay. So you were hearing through loud speakers or something, it was  1 hard to hear? 
2 A Yeah. I was all the way in the back, near the Monument at the one point, 
3 like, it was very, very cold, so I was trying to be fine near a wall. 
4 
5 
6 Q Okay. 
A To hide from the wind. 
Q And do you remember President Trump saying, and if you don't fight like 
7 hell, you're not going to have a country anymore? 
A I do not. 31 
8 
9 Q Okay. Do you recall President Trump saying anything about Vice President 
10 Pence during his speech? 
11 
12 
13 A No. Or that he --that he would have the power to overturn the election. 
Q Okay. So that's what you took President Trump to say or to mean? 
A I've heard him say that, but I mean, like, I --I can't --it's been so long, I can't 
14 remember exactly what was said at the speech. 
15 
16 Q That's okay, but --
A But I know that, like, that's the reason why we went down there, because we 
17 felt Pence could overturn the election. 
18 Q Oh, okay. So earlier you had told us that you had went to the rally because, 
19 you know, they're fun, they're a good time, you thought it would be President Trump's --
20 
21 
22 
23 A Yeah, Stop the Steal. 
Q All right. 
A Same thing. It's all goes in one, yeah. 
Q Sorry. Please let me finish the question, and then I think it would be good 
24 if you could repeat that answer. 
25 So are you representing then that going to a rally, President Trump's last rally, and  32 
1 overturning the election are all the same thing? I'm trying to understand. 
2 A Well, yeah, that's all --that's all included in Stop the Steal, right? I mean, I 
3 went down there to have fun. I went down --I went down just to be there, to show my 
4 support and just be there. I didn't plan on any of this happening. I didn't know any of 
5 this was going to get physical. 
6 Like I thought we were just going down. I thought they were going to have a 
7 court meeting, and whatever happens happens. Then I would go home. 
8 Q All right. So I'm just trying to understand. So if you thought it was 
9 President Trump's last rally, but you were also hearing that Vice President Pence could 
10 overturn the election, wasn't there a chance that it wouldn't be President Trump's last 
11 rally? 
12 
13 A 
Q Yes. But there's still a chance that would be his last rally. 
Okay. So you did believe Vice President Pence had the power to overturn 
14 the 2020 election? 
15 A At that --at some time, yeah, but not fully. You try to read up on it, you 
16 couldn't really get too much information on it. 
17 
18 Q 
A Do you remember where you --
1 --I wanted --the reasons going down, to show that --well, my one friend a 
19 good time because he's never been there. 
20 Q Right. But you also just said you went down, in part, because of Stop the 
21 Steal and to --
22 
23 A 
Q Well, yeah, I mean, they --
Please let me finish, Mr. Stackhouse. It sounded like you were going for 
24 Stop the Steal, and it sounded like it was in support of the idea that Vice President Pence 
25 could overturn the election. Is that correct?  1 A Well, yes. That's the whole point of the Stop the Steal Rally, the thought 
2 that it could be overturned. 
3 Q Thank you. And do you remember where you were, like, where were you 
4 getting the information that Vice President Pence could do that? 
5 A Just word-of-mouth, a little bit of, like, research. I mean, like I said, 
6 whatever, just word-of-mouth --
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 Q What is word-of-mouth? 
A --LAN News. LAN News. 
Q Okay. LAN News. Were you seeing that on --
A 
Q Newsmax. 
Newsmax. Were you seeing that --
A Yeah. 
Q --on Parler? 
A I don't think Parler was even active around that time, like, I think it was --I 
15 don't remember --I don't think it was --I mostly seen it on the news channels. 
16 
17 
18 
19 Q Okay. And you didn't have Face book at this time or Twitter, but --
A No. 
Q --was anyone talking about it on Telegram? 
A Telegram, I wasn't really too into Telegram. There would be people, like, 
20 on, like, on lnstagram, like, Ted Cruz, stuff like that and --and videos from him and stuff 
21 like that on lnstagram, I would see. 33 
22 Q Okay. So you saw Senator Cruz on lnstagram talking about Vice President's 
23 power to overturn the 2020 election results? 
24 A At one point. That's one video that stands outs. Like, if you were, 
25 like --yeah, that's one video that stands out.  34 
1 Q Do you remember any other videos on lnstagram by elected officials or Rudy 
2 Giuliani? 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 A The --the Hodgetwins. 
Q I'm sorry, the Hodgetwins? 
A Yeah. They would talk about it. Candace Owen. 
Q Candace Owen. Okay. Who --
A Dan Crenshaw. 
Q Dan Crenshaw. 
A Yeah. 
Q Sorry. I'm just repeating because there's little bit of an echo. So Dan 
11 Crenshaw. Can you explain who the Hodgetwins are? 
12 A They're two YouTube channel guys with millions and millions of followers. 
13 They go to every rally. I mean, you just --you can look them up. 
14 
15 
16 
17 Q Right. 
A They give up to date news. 
Q And what did they say about Vice President Pence's power? 
A That he would have the power to overturn the election if he thought it 
18 was --was the right thing to do. 
19 
20 Q Okay. And you trusted these news sources? 
A I just looked into it. I mean, like, I didn't make it my life. I would just hear 
21 about it. If I heard it, then okay, cool. If not, so be it. 
22 Q And were there a lot of conversations on January 6th with the people around 
23 you about Vice President Pence's ability to overturn the election? 
24 
25 A 
Q Not --not that I recall. 
Do you recall people talking about Congress certifying the electoral vote?  35 
1 A No. I don't think --it's weird because when you get down there, everyone 
2 just starts talking about other --no, it wasn't really --no, I don't recall any of that. 
3 Q Okay. But were you aware that Congress was certifying the electoral count 
4 that day, on January 6th? 
5 A I didn't know what was going on. I didn't know what they were going to 
6 do. Like I said, I just went down there to show my support. 
7 Q Okay. Do you remember President Trump saying anything about 
8 marching --attendees marching to the Capitol and that he would go with them? 
9 A I remember hearing him say I'd march down to the Capitol and show 
10 your --show something or --yeah, I remember him saying something like that, but I think 
11 I was already walking down, on the way down. 
12 
13 Q Okay. So you left before the --
A I had to find --1 had to find --I left to find --before the end because I had to 
14 find a bathroom. 
15 Q Understood. Was it always your intention to walk towards the Capitol after 
16 the speech? 
17 A Well, I thought that was part of the entire plan, like, you had people telling 
18 you there --while you're there, standing there, saying the speech here, then --then 
19 march --march down whatever that street was, that long street there. 
20 Q Okay. So ahead of time you believed that part of this involved a march to 
21 the Capitol? 
22 A I thought it was all part of one rally. I didn't know that there was 
23 separate --I thought it was all part of one little organized rally. 
24 
25 Q And where did you get that idea? 
A Just by how it was organized, people telling you what to do, go here, go  1 there, do this, where the gates were set up at, stuff like that. I thought --1 thought it 
2 was just part of the rally. 
3 
4 Q 
A Right. And did you have that idea before you got to D.C. on January 6th? 
I didn't know that they were that far apart. I didn't know that there was 
5 that much walking involved, to be honest with you. 
6 
7 Q 
A Right. But you did think there would be a march of some kind? 
Well, it's a --it's a rally with Stop the Steal. I mean, I guess people walk 
8 everywhere. Happened in Wildwood, people walk the streets too. The people were 
9 walking, they were marching in circles around the block there. 36 
10 Q Right. But for January 6th, I'm going to read a text that Mr. Gia nos sent to 
11 you on January 4th, 2021, so 2 days before January 6th, where he indicates his intention 
12 to attend the Stop the Steal Rally. So he says the main event is starting at 7 a.m., and 
13 then he says, quote, then march to Capitol. So did you --
14 
15 
16 
17 A Sure. 
Q --were you of the --sorry. 
Did you know before January 6th that there would be a march of some kind? 
A When I hear the word march, I just think a walk, so, yeah. I know it was like 
18 a --you walk back and forth. That's how I thought --happened at every other rally too. 
19 You walk different places. 
20 Q And how is what happened on January 6th different from a walk? People 
21 were walking, correct? 
22 A Yeah. But like they were just walking to different events and, like, going to 
23 different bars, going --
24 Q I'm sorry. You cut out, Mr. Stackhouse. 
25 - We'll go on a quick pause at 3:23.  1 
2 
3 [Recess.] 
BY-: 
Q All right. We'll go back on the record then. 
4 So I was trying to get a sense of why --why you're differentiating a march at an 
5 earlier rally from what happened on January 6th? 37 
6 A I thought --considered a march and a rally were the same exact thing, you're 
7 going somewhere, you know, to show your support. I wasn't planning on marching 
8 anywhere. 
9 
10 Q You weren't planning on marching anywhere? 
A No. I just end up going to the rally. I wasn't planning on walking- --I 
11 didn't want to walk anywhere. I didn't want to march. I just wanted to go to a rally 
12 and attend it and find somewhere cool to hang out with. That's usually what happens. 
13 You go down there, and you find somewhere cool to hang out at, and you stay in one 
14 spot. 
15 
16 Q Okay. So --
A But when I hear the word march and a rally, I thought it was all just one 
17 thing. You go to the Monument, you hang out, show your support, you find a group of 
18 people, and you do what you do. And then you go home at the end of the night. 
19 Q But why did you think that marching to the Capitol would be part of the Stop 
20 the Steal rally? 
21 A That's how --well, that's how it was set up, I guess, right? We've --we've 
22 seen it. We've seen everything set up. And there were speeches at the Capitol and at 
23 the Monument all together. So they were --they were just all, just one big --one big 
24 rally. 
25 Q Okay. And did you take any -- 38 
I didn't think I was, like, there to march. 1 
2 A 
Q Understood. Did you take any --I'm sorry, Mr. Stackhouse. Did you take 
3 anything about going to the Capitol, the specific building, as important? 
4 
5 
6 
7 A Going --I mean, I didn't think of anything. I was just going with the flow. -BY 
Q Do you recall seeing advertisements for, like, the event at the Ellipse and 
8 then a follow-on march to the Capitol all in the same advertisement? 
9 A Yes. Everything was all together. I didn't think it was two different things. 
10 I just thought everything was coming together at once. Like I said, I didn't pay too much 
11 attention to it. Once I just heard the date and seen the date, then okay, fine, we'll go. 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 Q Okay. Thank you. 
A I thought it was all just one set up, just one event. 
Q Understood. Thank you very much. 
So on your way to the --when did you start marching to the Capitol then? 
A I started walking by myself and I started buying, like, souvenirs and stuff like 
18 that because I couldn't find anybody, because I was by myself for a couple hours. And 
19 so I started buying all souvenirs, and I found a bathroom. 
20 And then the only way to contact with people, because there was no service down 
21 there, was through that app, Telegram. 
22 
23 Q Okay. And when did you meet up with Mr. Gianos and Ms. Myers? 
A Well, I ran into --ran into Rachel and them and I --and then I started --I 
24 think I communicated --where he was at because he couldn't see where anyone was or 
25 get together. Like I said, I was by myself.  1 So then, like, I met them on the corner. God, I don't know --I can't --I don't 
2 remember what corner it was. And then we just started walking down, the four of us. 
3 
4 
5 Q 
A 
Q Okay. And do you have any sense of what time that was? 
Oh, man, I want to say around 12:30. 
Okay. And were you communicating with other people via Telegram, or 
6 was it just Ms. Myers --39 
7 A No. Just the one guy, Mike. I wasn't too familiar with Telegram. I didn't 
8 really know how to use it. He had to show me that day, in fact, how to contact him. 
9 
10 
11 
12 Q 
A 
Q 
A And Mike is Mr. Gianos, correct? 
Yes. 
Okay. So when you reunite with these two, what do you do? 
Well, they had to go to the bathroom too, so they found a bathroom. And 
13 then we started walking down. And then we --then we see --we get down there and 
14 see there's massive, massive crowds and then thought this must be it. 
15 
16 
17 
18 Q 
A 
Q 
A Okay. And what were you hearing as you're walking to the Capitol? 
I don't remember. I don't remember. 
Nothing sticks out? 
No. I'm sorry. I really don't remember. I think we were just talking 
19 about --the general conversation. I know we were all freezing, like --like, literally 
20 freezing. 
21 
22 
23 
24 Q 
A 
Q 
A Right. But were people around you chanting? 
Yeah. I just remember the Stop the Steal. 
Did you hear other chants, like, hang Mike Pence? 
I heard them down at the Capitol, like, from other crowds but not when I 
25 was walking down.  1 Q Okay. Did you hear anything else about other elected officials as you're 
2 walking down? 
3 
4 A 
Q No. I really don't --I don't think so. It was more the social walk. 
Right. Did you see any signs of violence as you were walking to the 
5 Capitol? 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 A 
Q No. 
Did you see a lot of police? 
A Yeah. Standing there along the sides and stuff. 
Q Okay. And when you get to the Capitol --
A 
Q No, no. 
Understood. When you get to the Capitol, like, area, can you describe 
12 what you're seeing? 
13 A We get there, and I'm starting to see people --there's like, I guess, the 
14 Capitol police were just shooting --shooting stuff into the crowd. You kept on hearing 
15 these loud flash bangs, kept on hearing all this stuff and, like, smoke and I'm --huh? 40 
16 Q I was going to say, what does that --so you hear flash bangs, you see smoke. 
17 What does that make you think? 
18 A I mean, what the hell is going on. But then I --so we just get closer and 
19 closer just to look and see what's going on, and we're watching all this madness, like, 
20 unfold outside. We're just looking at it. And this is all near the stage. This is not up 
21 top or anything. We're just watching, like, what could be going on. And we're looking 
22 into the crowd then, like, because we didn't understand why people were being shot 
23 with, like --like, all this stuff. 
24 Because when we --when we got down there, it wasn't --it didn't look too --it 
25 wasn't violent. But maybe I was on the wrong side of the building as well.  1 
2 
3 Q 
A But you just said there were flash bangs and smoke and people -­
Yeah. But I'm not gonna --maybe because you guys are alert --
Q Sorry, Mr. Stackhouse, please let me finish. Please let me finish. So if 
4 you're seeing smoke and flash bangs and people crowding --
5 
6 
7 A Yeah. 
Q --that didn't seem violent to you? 
A Well, I'm trying to figure out why it was happening. There was nobody 
8 trying to make their way up when I got down there. I just didn't know what was going 41 
9 on. We all --so it was just me, my friend Scott, and Rachel. We walk up to the side --I 
10 don't know where the guy Mike went --and we were just standing there watching. 
11 BY 
12 Q Where were you when you arrived at the Capitol, Mr. Stackhouse? You 
13 described a stage. So when you were facing the stage, was it on your right side or your 
14 left side, if you recall? 
15 
16 A Left. 
Q On your left side. Okay. And approximately what time, if you remember, 
17 did you get to the Capitol building? 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 A Huh. 
- No, just at the grounds, I think, 
BY 
Q To the grounds. 
A I think it was, like, an hour walk, maybe, something like --took us, like, an 
23 hour to get there, 45 minutes, 40 minutes or something. And we left around, I think 
24 12:30 or something. 
25 Q The reason why I'm asking this question --you said around 12:30?  1 
2 - No. He left --so probably around 1:30. 
Okay. The reason why I'm asking this question is because it 
3 looks like, let's see, it looks like you all entered the Capitol at around, what, 2:22 p.m. 
4 Does that sound about right? 
Mr. Stackhouse. Yes --
- Sorry, we can't hear you, Mr. Stackhouse. 
Mr. Stackhouse. Yes. Around 2:20, yes. 
BY 42 
5

7 
8 
9 Q So the first breach of the Capitol was at 2:13 p.m. so you're walking into the 
10 Capitol just 7 minutes later. And I think, look, we've seen the images of people violently 
11 pushing into the Capitol in that first push when they went in at 2:13. 
12 So I guess it's just hard for us to understand how you didn't see the violence if the 
13 first person who broke the window, the Proud Boy who broke the window at 2:13, and 
14 then you enter at 2:20, how you did not see this violence? 
15 A I wasn't near anybody up top when there was --there was the window 
16 broken. I was right near the front door when they --someone --a guy from inside, it 
17 was an officer, from inside the building, pushed the door open towards us. There was 
18 nothing broken near me where I --where we entered. 
19 If you were seeing it, there was just a group of people standing at the back door, 
20 again, at the other entrance maybe or whatever. But when we got up to the top, the 
21 door wasn't even open. They opened it from the inside. 
22 Q No, I understand that when you walked in, you might not have seen people 
23 breaking windows. But the fact that you entered just 7 minutes after someone broke 
24 windows and there was 30 or 40 minutes of clashing with police to get to where they 
25 arrived, I guess I just find it hard that you didn't witness at least individuals clashing with  43 
1 the police. 
A Oh, no. 2 
3 Q You already talked --you already about flash bangs. I guess I'm just trying 
4 to understand why'd you keep going forward, and why didn't you leave? 
5 A That's when I got down there, there was flash bangs and all like that. Then 
6 as it got --I guess, got, like, all throughout the day, yes, the crowd got more violent, and I 
7 did see that violence.  1 
2 [3:31 p.m.] 
3 BY 
4 
5 Q Okay. So why didn't you leave? 
A I mean, interest, I guess. I wasn't --I wasn't going to get violent. I was 
6 just --I was watching, I was there. 
7 
8 Q What were you interested in? 
A Well, actually, right behind us, there was a rapper performing. His name 
9 was Bryson Gray. So we were listening to the rapper perform. 44 
10 Q That's not what I'm asking. I'm asking, why were you interested in keeping 
11 going forward after you witnessed violence? 
12 A I was just walking with it. I was --it was the Capitol building, I was on a 
13 chant, Stop the Steal. I didn't --I didn't know --I did not know anyone was in the Capitol 
14 building. I thought they were just up top. 
15 BY 
16 
17 Q 
A Right. But you heard people chanting at this time, hang Mike Pence, right? 
I guess in the crowd, yeah, just people chanting. That's whatever. That's 
18 nothing to do with me. But maybe they wanted to go up, I don't know. I didn't know 
19 anyone was going to go in the Capitol building. And when I --when I got up there, I 
20 didn't know anyone was inside the Capitol building. 
21 
22 Q Where did you think they were going? 
A Just up top. To maybe go around the building and protest, to get closer. 
23 didn't think anyone was going in. 
24 BY 
25 Q I guess I don't understand how you didn't think people were going in, but yet  45 
1 you walked in, right? I guess it's --it's --
Just because I didn't think --because when I got up there -- 2 
3 A 
Q Wait, wait, let me finish my thought. It's not us trying to --we're just trying 
4 to understand why you walk into the Capitol, especially the time you walk in, because 
5 when you walk in, there's actual violence going on around you, while you continue to 
6 push forward and walk in the Capitol? 
7 A When they opened --it was someone opened the door for us, we went in 
8 because we were freezing. That is the --that's the God honest truth. The main reason 
9 we went into that Capitol building because we were freezing cold. We couldn't feel our 
10 feet. 
11 
12 So why didn't you turn around and go backwards to your hotel? 
Mr. Stackhouse. We couldn't. We were so far up there, the crowd behind us. 
13 The easiest way was going forward. 
14 Okay. 
15 BY 
16 
17 
18 Q Thank you 
Did you see broken glass, broken windows, any --
A Not once. When I --
19 Q Please let me --Mr. Stackhouse, please let us finish the whole question. 
20 know it's difficult like this. 
21 So I was asking if you saw broken windows, broken glass, you know, overturned 
22 barriers, any sort of evidence of a struggle on your way into the Capitol? 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A Not one. 
Okay. Thank you. And what did you do when you were inside? 
I just walked --it was very, very crowded. I remember seeing a grandmom  46 
1 in a wheelchair. I seen little kids, so I'm, like, thinking, it's not that bad. So we just 
2 walked through, chanted. Somehow we followed people upstairs, walked into Pelosi's 
3 office --Pelosi's office for maybe a couple seconds. Wasn't there long. I had my hands 
4 down my back the entire time because I was nervous, and I didn't want to touch anything. 
5 And then upstairs, that's when we first started hearing people break things. And 
6 if you recover my videos that were on my phone, you hear me yelling, stop breaking stuff. 
7 You hear me say that. 
8 
9 Q 
A Okay. What did you hear when you were in Speaker Pelosi's office? 
I didn't hear much. I wasn't inside that long. I kind of left when someone 
10 mentioned taking a crap in the --in the corner or something like that. 
11 
12 Q 
A So you heard somebody say that? 
Like I said, like --yeah. Someone was talking about it, I don't know. Like I 
13 said, like, I had the nervous feeling that we weren't --we weren't supposed to be in there. 
14 And I didn't want to be in there, but like I said, we were freezing, and my hands are 
15 behind my back from when we were upstairs. I didn't want to touch anything. We 
16 walked, I guess, to the front and opened a door and overlooked the entire, I guess, the 
17 one street. And then we seen all these cops, you know, ready to come in and were, like, 
18 nope, let's go. 
19 BY 
20 Q Why did you feel uncomfortable? And I totally hear you, you're saying you 
21 walked in because you were cold. You made it to the Speaker's office. You were 
22 nervous, so you had your hands behind your back. But help us understand why you 
23 were nervous? 
24 A I mean, like, I'm in the Capitol building. Like, I knew what I was doing was 
25 wrong, but I didn't want to believe it. I --I felt like I was just following the rally, I went  47 
1 with the flow, and I got myself to a point where I couldn't turn back. 
2 So I was very, very nervous. 
3 Q When you found your way to the Speaker's office, like, how did you wind up 
4 there? Did you know where you were going, or did the people you were following know 
5 where they were going? 
6 A I had no --I had no earthly idea where I was going. We walked past a 
7 doorway and I --it says Pelosi on top of the doorway, and it was locked. And I'm --we're 
8 walking back, like, okay, stay away. And then someone kicks it open. So out of 
9 curiosity, I walk in. 
10 Q Did you hear anybody around you, though, who seemed like they know 
11 where they were going when they went to the Speaker's office? 
12 A I don't --I don't recall. I don't. It's like people were just frantic. 
13 Q Did you hear anybody chanting anything about the Speaker, about trying to 
14 find Speaker Pelosi? We've heard audio of this already. I'm trying to understand, did 
15 you hear people looking for Ms. Pelosi? 
16 A I don't --I don't remember what people were saying. It's been so long ago. 
17 Like, I remember hearing a lot of things, but I was also, like, very, very, like, 
18 uncomfortable too because there was --I guess there was also pepper spray being 
19 sprayed in there, and that would get in your lungs and your throat and stuff like that too. 
20 So I wasn't really focused on other people. I was kind of more focused on getting 
21 the heck out of there. 
22 
23 Q BY 
Okay. Do you remember, like, why were you curious about going in 
24 Speaker Pelosi's office? 
25 A I don't have an answer for that. It just, the door opened, and I was right  48 
1 there when it happened, and I, just out of curiosity, said, I'm going to walk through. And 
2 I literally walked through, maybe for 5 seconds, then out. 
3 
4 Q Okay. Do you remember seeing any Proud Boys around you? 
A No. I don't remember seeing --I can't recall who it was. It ranged from 
5 everyone, from young to old, from male to female, from White to Black, everything, it 
6 was just everything. 
7 Q So was part of your hope of stopping the steal, attending President Trump's 
8 rally, did going into the Capitol have anything to do with that? 
9 
10 
11 A 
Q 
A No. I didn't know how I ended up there. I didn't want to be there. 
Did you --
Like I said, I wanted a nice, fun rally, man, and like, it just turned into 
12 something that I didn't want to be. And, like, it's a day that I'm going to regret for the 
13 rest of my life. 
14 Q Understood. Do you get the sense that other people in there were hoping 
15 to keep stop --keep going with Stop the Steal? 
16 A Yeah. 
17 
18 Q You heard a lot of chants about Stop the Steal? 
A We heard chants, like, to that. And you can tell by, like, probably what 
19 people --some people were wearing. They're, like, where the heck are you from? 
20 Like, why are you dressed like you're in the military? Why are you dressed you're ready 
21 for war? A lot of things just didn't add up. 
22 Q Okay. So you got the impression based on what you were seeing and 
23 hearing that there were people in who were hoping to stop the certification of the 
24 electoral vote or just, you know, keep President Trump as President? 
25 A I had a feeling that there were people in there who were not just there to  49 
1 chant. 
Q And by not just there to chant, you mean precisely? 
A Violence. 
Q Violence against whom? 2 
3 
4 
5 A Against anyone who got in their way. I can --like, I'm not sure what party 
6 they represent or who they're --but there were people there who looked like they were 
7 straight from militias. 
8 Q Okay. And did you get the impression that the people who were standing 
9 in the way would be the people who were trying to certify the 2020 election for President 
10 Joe Biden? 
11 
12 
13 
14 but --
15 A Yes. 
Q Okay. Thank you very much. 
Do you remember why you eventually left the Capitol? I think you mentioned it, 
A Yeah. I mean, like --like I said, at first, I kind of felt like I was just, 
16 like --almost, like, forced in because I had nowhere else to go. And then we got up top, 
17 and we took a picture of, like, the crowd and stuff like that on the streets. 
18 And when you look down, you see all these police officers, and I'm like, Rach, I'm 
19 like, let's go, this is getting ugly. We're not supposed to be here. 
20 Q Got it. So I believe you left before President Trump's video at 4:30, but just 
21 for the record, did you see President Trump's 4:30-ish video asking everybody to leave? 
22 
23 A No. I was already back --I think I was already back in my hotel by then. 
Q Okay. Thank you. So right after, in the days after you left the Capitol, did 
24 you talk to Mr. Gianos and Ms. Myers? 
25 A Yeah.  50 
Do you remember what you were talking about? 1 
2 Q 
A Yeah. I said, F the government, I don't regret one thing. Because at that 
3 time I felt like I really didn't do anything wrong, because I didn't touch or break anything, 
4 and we were just in and out. 
5 Do I feel different now? Completely. I regret every single moment of that day. 
6 I regret --I regret getting involved in politics to be honest with you. 
7 
8 Q 
A Understood. And we'll --
1 regret --I regret falling into deep holes. I regret looking at social media. 
9 I regret believing stuff that wasn't true. 
10 Q Thank you. We'll give you a chance to expand on that in just a little bit, but 
11 I want to focus again on how you were feeling at that moment. So at that time, did you 
12 still think President Trump would be President come January 20th, 2021? 
13 
14 A After the Capitol? 
Q Yeah. At like --at the inauguration that would follow, did you think 
15 President Trump would stay President? 
16 A I think there was a slight possibility I thought that it could've been 
17 overturned, but --and also like in my head and reality, like, if it could've been overturned, 
18 wouldn't it have already been overturned? 
19 Q Right. Do you think President Trump's speech had any --or later speeches 
20 had anything to do with your belief that he could still stay in power? 
21 
22 A Not from his speeches, no. 
Q What was giving you the idea that there was a chance the election could still 
23 be overturned? 
24 A Certain things that people hear. It's, like, certain --like, just outrageous 
25 conspiracies about, like, America not being a country no more and it being a Republic, like  51 
1 weird things, like far-fetched ideas. 
2 Q Okay. So you have --it's hard to tell from the Gianos-Myers complaint, but 
3 you have a text on January 7th, and they had admitted a bunch of text messages, 
4 discussing whether the election results would be overturned. And you say, I think this is 
5 what he was talking about in his speech. Do you have any idea what you were 
6 referencing there? 
7 
8 
9 A I don't. And I'm not even sure what speech. 
Q Okay. That's okay. It was a long time ago. 
A Yeah, I don't --and honestly it probably wasn't from that speech during the 
10 day, because you could barely hear anything he was saying. So I didn't hear that speech 
11 from that day pretty much really, and I didn't hear the 4:30 one. So it had to be from 
12 another --some other thing. 
13 Q Okay. But is it your belief that you were seeing on social media, you 
14 mentioned like outrageous conspiracies, you were seeing this stuff somewhere on social 
15 media? 
16 
17 
18 
19 on? 
20 
21 A Yeah. 
Q Okay. Thank you. -, do you have any anything to follow-up before we move 
Nothing from me. Thank you. 
Thank you. So Ms. Akpan, we usually ask this question of counsel, if 
22 you could just describe the current status of Mr. Stackhouse's case for the record. 
23 
24 
25 Ms. Akpan. Sure. We are pending sentencing. 
- Okay. And he had pied guilty previously, correct? 
Ms. Akpan. Yes.  1

4 BY-: 
Q Okay. Thank you. 
Okay. Mr. Stackhouse, this is the last sort of portion of our questioning here, 
5 and you started talking about it a little bit when you were mentioning your regrets. So 
6 can you expand a little bit about how you feel about January 6th now looking back? 52 
7 A Without a doubt, it is the worst day of my life. That is --that's that. It is, 
8 the worst day of my life. 
9 Q Right. And you mentioned that you wish you had never fallen down into 
10 some sort of holes of information --
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 A Conspiracies. 
Q Okay. So, yeah, please --
A --yeah. 
Q --expand on that. 
A QAnon. 
Q So you watched a lot of QAnon --or saw a lot of --
A Yeah. 
Q --QAnon stuff? 
A No, I would follow it. Yeah. 
Q Okay. Did QAnon really influence your beliefs about the 2020 election? 
A 
Q Yes. 
Did you see posts on QAnon about January, I don't know, sorry. Did you 
23 see QAnon-related posts about January 6th? 
24 A No, not really about January 6th. They were more into, like, deeper and, 
25 like, bigger things but you would see people there wearing Q, stuff like that, flags --Q  53 
1 flags, stuff like that. But I never really tried to get into it about January 6th. Like I said, 
2 January 6th was the flyer, and I just wanted to go to a rally. 
3 
4 Q So what did you take away from Q about the 2020 election? 
A That's when they pumped your head with a bunch of information about 
5 how --you started thinking it could be overturned, how illegal vote --of mail-in voting 
6 over certain time is illegal and they're going to be thrown out, that they're going to get 
7 thrown out, and certain --certain representatives or something are going to do this, to do 
8 this, to change the election this. They didn't --it went all over the place. 
9 
10 Q 
A Right. And do you remember why you started paying attention to Q? 
Because when COVID first happened, I got very, very bored, and I didn't have 
11 any work, and I just --I just --it became a hobby almost at one point when I had nothing 
12 to do. 
13 
14 Q So you would actively go into the internet and look for Q-related things? 
A Yes. And it was, like, sometimes last 12 hours. Sometimes, you know, go 
15 overnight. 
16 
17 Q And had --
A I had nothing to do. Nothing was open, no work, no nothing. You know 
18 what I mean? 
19 Q Yeah, no, I understood. I'm just wondering, did you talk to your friends and 
20 family about Q? 
21 A Yeah. 
22 Q And how did they feel about the amount of time you were spending in that 
23 world? 
24 A Well, my dad pretty much wanted to disown me. A lot of other friends 
25 were just listening to it, taking in, whatever, blah, blah, blah, you know. And some other  1 friends who were very into it as well. So it was all over the place. But everyone had 
2 their own opinion, and everyone is entitled to their own opinion. So it's not like I'm 
3 just not --no one is wrong for it. 
4 
5 
6 
7 Q 
A 
Q 
A Did you keep following Q through January 6th? 
No. Until January 6th? 
Yeah. Like up through --like, up until January 6th. 
I --I kind of stopped getting into it a couple months before that, because 54 
8 some of this stuff just started going crazy. But, like, you see some stuff here and there, 
9 and, yeah, it didn't really --it didn't influence me about January 6th or have anything to 
10 do with me going down January 6th. I just, I have seen posts about it --I did see posts 
11 about it, but it didn't influence me. 
12 
13 
14 Q 
A 
Q But fair to say it influenced your views about the 2020 election, correct? 
It did, yeah. It did. 
And were there other --you mentioned conspiracies. Were there other 
15 conspiracies you were following at the time? 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Yeah. So many. 
Anything specific come to mind that you want to talk about? 
Are you ready --are you ready for a laugh? 
I am not laughing --
JFK Jr. was going to come back --JFK Jr. was going to come back on 
21 January 20th --or January 6th and announce he was Vice President or he was President 
22 now. 
23 
24 
25 Q 
A 
Q Was that a Q-based conspiracy? 
Yes. 
Okay. So did you, on January 6th when you were in Washington, D.C., did  1 you think that would happen? 
2 A No. Did I want it to happen? I mean, it'd be pretty cool. Did I think it 
3 was going to happen? Absolutely not. 
4 
5 
6 but --
7 Q 
A 
Q But there was an outside belief or hope that it could happen? 
There's no way that could've happened. It would've been nice to see, 
I just meant on day of, when you were there, did any part of you believe it 
8 could happen? 
9 
10 A No. 
Q And can you just expand a little bit how that --like, how would JFK Jr. 
11 become Vice President? 55 
12 A Geez. Sometimes --like, his name, like, he's under an alias of, like, Vincent 
13 Fusca, who was a guy that looks just like JFK Jr., who was always at Trump rallies, 
14 somehow he's secretly aimed at Trump's party and, like, was going to make an 
15 announcement that he was going to --that he was the next President or he was next 
16 President of the Republic of the United States or something like that. It --it gets so 
17 far-fetched. 
18 Q Understood. So how do you feel about all of these, like Q and other 
19 conspiracies, now more than a year later? 
20 
21 
22 
23 A I hate them. 
Q Why do you hate them? 
A Because I allowed them --I allowed them to literally ruin my life. 
Q You believe they did influence your decision to go in some way to 
24 January 6th? 
25 A No, not that. Not --they just --they just got me kind of into --involved and  56 
1 interested in politics because it seemed so interesting to me. If it wasn't ever for that, I 
2 might've never --never been so involved or even cared. 
3 But having Q, that did not --that didn't really influence me going down 
4 January 6th at all. It had nothing to do with Q at all. 
Q Thank you. I understand. 5 
6 So what about your views about the election being stolen? Do you still believe it 
7 was stolen? 
8 
9 
10 A 
Q 
A No. 
Do you have any idea what changed your mind? 
The reality of, like, if it was stolen, I mean, wouldn't it have already been 
11 changed by now? 
12 Q All right. Thank you. And how about President Trump, what are your 
13 views about him today? 
14 A I have no idea. I don't even --I don't follow him no more. I don't --I don't 
15 even have social media. I try not to pay attention to it. I don't remember anything 
16 anymore. I don't --I don't get involved in it. I don't want to be involved in it. 
17 Q Did you ever assign any blame to former President Trump for what 
18 happened on January 6th? 
19 A No. It's my fault because I did it. 
20 Q Maybe not personally to you necessarily, but just in general, do you feel 
21 President Trump played any role in what happened? 
22 A I mean, he held a rally there, but --and when it comes down to it, it's no 
23 one's fault but mine. I made the choice to walk into the Capitol building. I made the 
24 choice to go down. It was my fault. It was the dumbest decision of my entire life. 
25 Q Understood. Thank you.  57 
1 So we covered a lot today, and we appreciate your willingness to talk to us. It 
2 can be hard for us to get a lot of people in your shoes who are willing to share their 
3 stories, and we're really looking for all perspectives when we do this, so we do very much 
4 appreciate you taking the time to speak with us. 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 A You're welcome. 
Q Is there anything else that you want to share that we missed? 
A Not --I don't think so. If you have any more questions, I'll answer them. 
Ms. Akpan. Can I ask a question? 
Go ahead, Ms. Akpan. 
Ms. Akpan. Mr. Stackhouse, I know that we got through the shirt discussion, but 
11 I wanted to just get you to clarify again whether you purchased the shirt, the Proud Boys 
12 shirt, because of any thought that you had about feeling protected with the --
13 
14 
15 Mr. Stackhouse. Oh, no. 
Ms. Akpan. --Proud Boys? 
Mr. Stackhouse. I --I really--I really just purchased the shirt because it was a 
16 nice shirt, and when you bought one, you got one half off. And it was American colors 
17 and --yeah, it had nothing to do with actual --the actual Proud Boys when I bought it. 
18 just liked the shirt. 
19 And like I said, when I did see the --when I did see the Proud Boys on TV in the, 
20 like, there's different Proud Boy groups, like there's different, I guess, from all over, I 
21 guess, the U.S., I guess. 
22 And maybe just the one --maybe the ones that I just seen, they were standing 
23 with the police. They were just --they were just --they weren't doing anything. So, 
24 like, one, they were --they were just there, like, I never think anything bad of it. I never 
25 thought anything bad of it. I --I didn't probably equate it with a fricking gang, like, I  58 
1 don't want to do that. 
2 - Understood. Can I follow up on that actually, Mr. Stackhouse? 
3 Just in terms of, like, where you bought it, you mentioned you bought it from a Trump 
4 website. Do you remember specifically? 
5 Mr. Stackhouse. Yeah. I forget, but the FBI does have that information 
6 because the day I was arrested, I gave them that site. 
7 Okay. But you don't --you don't remember specifically? You just 
8 remember buying --
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 Mr. Stackhouse. I don't. I really don't. I'm sorry. I'm not -­
That's okay. We just want to --
Ms. Akpan. Mr. Stackhouse? 
Mr. Stackhouse. But they do --they do have that site. 
Ms. Akpan. Mr. Stackhouse, was it something like a 45, did it have some kind of 
14 reference to 45 in the website, do you remember? 
15 Mr. Stackhouse. Oh, man. I can't --I can't remember. I can't remember the 
16 exact website, I'm sorry, I really can't. But the FBI has the site. 
17 Ms. Akpan. Oh, Mr. Stackhouse, one more question on that site. Was it 
18 something like 19---was it 1776 or 776 or something like that? 
19 Mr. Stackhouse. Oh, the 1776 shop, maybe. Yes, it's --yeah, something --yes, 
20 that is in it, yes, 1770---yes. 
21 BY-: 
22 
23 
24 
25 Q Okay. So it's something like 17---
A That --that might be it actually. 
Q Okay. Thank you very much. 
All right. Ms. Akpan, do you have any other questions?  59 
1 Ms. Akpan. Just one more. When you talked about the --you mentioned there 
2 was a guy that looked kind of like JFK Jr. at rallies. 
3 
4 Mr. Stackhouse. Oh, yeah. 
Ms. Akpan. Was that something you had seen at other rallies or other people 
5 talked about at other rallies you attended? 
6 Mr. Stackhouse. Oh, yeah. I mean, there's flags for him and everything, and, 
7 like, at every single one of Trump's rallies, in the background where he's on the podium, 
8 the guy, Vincent Fusca, is in the back. At every single one, some random guy, and he 
9 looks like JFK, and his wife looks like JFK's wife. It's the craziest thing, but it's a very wild 
10 conspiracy. 
11 
12 
13 
14 Ms. Akpan. Is it --you said his name was --he was referred to as vintage -­
Mr. Stackhouse. Vincent, V-i-n-c-e-n-t, F-u-s-c-a. F-u-s-c-a. Fusca. 
Okay. 
Mr. Stackhouse. So, like, you would see like --you would see, like, Trump JFK 
15 2020, or Trump JFK Jr. 2024 as referring to that guy. 
16 Got it. Thank you. Well, if there are no other questions, we just 
17 want to say thank you again for taking the time to talk to us, and I think we can go off the 
18 record at 3:57 p.m.
