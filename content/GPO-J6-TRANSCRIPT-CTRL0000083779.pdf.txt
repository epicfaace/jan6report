3 This is a transcribed interview of Stephanie Grisham conducted by the House 
4 Select Committee to investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol 
5 pursuant to House Resolution 503. 
6 At this time, I'd like to ask the witness to please state your full name and spell 
7 your last name for the record. 
8 Ms. Grisham. Sure. Stephanie Ann Grisham, G-r-i-s-h-a-m. 
9 Thank you, Ms. Grisham. 
10 This will be a staff-led interview, although I know at least one member of the 
11 committee, the vice chair, Ms. Cheney, has joined. Others may, but I don't expect that 
12 they will. 
13 Ms. Grisham. No problem. 
14 My name is-. I serve as the chief investigative counsel 
15 for the select committee, and I believe , one of our professional staff 
16 members, is also on. And I see Ms. Cheney has now come off of mute and is here to say 
17 hello. 
18 
19 
20 
21 Ms. Cheney. I just wanted to say good afternoon and thanks for joining us. 
Ms. Grisham. Hi there. Of course. Nice toe-meet you. 
Ms. Cheney. Thank you. 
- So, Ms. Grisham, there is also an official reporter who is 
22 transcribing the record of the interview. To make it easier for her, just wait until each of 
23 my questions is complete before you begin your response. I will try to wait until you 
24 finish your answer before I ask the next question. 
25 Ms. Grisham. Okay.  1 The reporter can't record nonverbal responses like shaking your 
2 head. 
3 Ms. Grisham. Got it. 
4 So it's important that you answer each question with an audible, 
5 verbal response. 
6 
7 Ms. Grisham. Okay. 
I want you to just provide complete answers based on your best 
8 recollection. If you don't know the answer, just simply say that you don't recall or you 
9 don't know. Don't hesitate to ask me to repeat a question if it's not clear. 4 
10 This is voluntary. You have not been subpoenaed. And although this interview 
11 is not under oath, I just want to remind you the same thing we remind every witness, that 
12 it is unlawful to deliberately provide false information to Congress. 
13 
14 Ms. Grisham. Understood. 
Okay. Great. 
15 And if you need a break at any point, you just need a couple minutes for a phone 
16 call or to hit the restroom, just let me know and we can stop. 
17 
18 
19 Ms. Grisham. Okay. 
We'll do this at your pace. 
Ms. Grisham. Okay, thank you. 
20 EXAMINATION 
21 BY 
22 Q Okay. Great. All right, why don't you just start, Ms. Grisham, by telling 
23 me, maybe work backwards from your last White House job going back in time. Tell me 
24 about the positions in which you served in the Trump administration. 
25 A Starting with the last one?  5 
Yeah. 1 
2 Q 
A Okay. I was chief of staff to Melania Trump in the East Wing. I'm going to 
3 be terrible with dates. I have the worst memory, which you and I talked about the first 
4 time. 
5 Prior to being her chief of staff, I was press secretary and director of 
6 communications for the President and I was press secretary and director of 
7 communications for the First Lady. 
8 Prior to that, I was the First Lady's director of communications. Prior to that, I 
9 was the deputy press secretary for the President, which is the role I started at the White 
10 House. 
11 
12 
13 Q 
A 
Q And you started, I believe, right in January of 2017, the very beginning? 
Correct. First day, yes. 
And served until January 6th of 2021 when you resigned. And we'll get to 
14 the reasons for that. 
15 
16 A 
Q Sure. 
Before that, Ms. Grisham, did you have a role on the Trump campaign, the 
17 Presidential campaign in 2016? 
18 A Yes. 
19 Q What was your role there? 
20 A I joined the campaign in July 2015. I believe it was his first rally in Phoenix, 
21 Arizona. So you could double-check the dates. And I was just working as an advance 
22 person, a press advance person. I started working for him after that. 
23 I joined the campaign as his director of press advance, and I was with him until we 
24 joined the White House. I was named to the transition team, but I was never paid by 
25 any transition team. I was always paid by the campaign.  6 
1 Q I see. Okay. And you mentioned Arizona. Is it fair to say that your 
2 career in media and in politics started in Arizona, that was the place where you had 
3 worked prior to your time with President Trump on his campaign and at the White 
4 House? 
5 A Yes. But prior to that, I worked for Mitt Romney on his Presidential 
6 campaign with Paul Ryan, and I was a press advance person for them. 
7 Q Got it. Understood. 
8 So let's talk a little bit about going back to your very last job? 
9 Oh, and I see Pete Aguilar, Representative Aguilar has joined now as well, another 
10 member of the select committee. 
11 Welcome, Mr. Aguilar. 
12 Your role, Ms. Grisham, as the chief of staff to the First Lady, you were chief of 
13 staff and spokesperson, is that right, you sort of served both roles? 
14 
15 A 
Q Correct. Yeah. I served so many roles at the same time, yes. 
Tell me a little bit generally about sort of day to day what that work 
16 involved. I assume close coordination with the First Lady, helping her with everything 
17 from communications to managing her time. Is that right? 
18 A Yes, of course. I would talk to her about different events that she was 
19 requested for. I would talk to her about obviously any interviews, any press inquiries I 
20 got. I wrote all of her speeches. I did all of her communications. I oversaw the East 
21 Wing team. 
22 She was very, very hands-on, so any press inquiry that she ever got went past her, 
23 and we would work together to form a response if she chose. 
24 Q Yeah. In that role, Ms. Grisham, when you were talking to the First Lady 
25 about communications issues, potentially statements that she would make, how much  7 
1 coordination did you have with the West Wing, with the President's communications 
2 team? 
3 A None, ever. And that was at her preference. The East Wing and the West 
4 Wing were to operate very separately. 
5 Q Interesting. So if she wanted to comment on something or say something, 
6 you didn't need approval, permission, coordination in any way with your counterpart in 
7 the West Wing? 
8 A Never. I did give, when Sarah Sanders was the press secretary, I did give 
9 her a heads-up often because we had a great working relationship, but that was just 
10 because we had a good friendship. Mrs. Trump was always very clear that the East 
11 Wing and the West Wing were separate. 
12 Q I see. Were you ever part of broader strategic discussions, communications 
13 discussions, like, what is the message that we want to ensure we put forth today or this 
14 week, like, with the press secretary, with the director of communications over in the West 
15 Wing, or does that separation also include prospective strategy discussions? 
16 A Yeah. That was --no, I was not part of that ever, not --not before when I 
17 was first working for her and then not after. 
18 Q Okay. How about, Ms. Grisham, during the 2020 reelection campaign, did 
19 you have any coordination, communication with the folks that were doing 
20 communications for the campaign? 
21 A Yes. I worked with some of the people on the campaign who --or, yeah, I 
22 was reached out to by some of the people on the campaign --I'm going to try to think of 
23 names specifically, but --who would say that it would be very helpful if she would go and 
24 speak here or there. 
25 Q I see.  1 
2 A 
Q And then I would talk to Mrs. Trump about it, and we would go from there. 
Do you recall who on the campaign was sort of your point of contact for 
3 those kinds of requests? 
4 A I'm trying to think. I spoke with Justin Caporale a lot, Jason Miller was 
5 another big one, and Justin Clark. 
6 Q Do you remember anything specific that the campaign asked the First Lady 
7 to do that you facilitated? Any appearance or speech or communications issue? 
8 A They --I mean, they often asked. They often asked if she would just be 
9 either with him at an event or if she would be willing to go to an event. 
10 We did do an event that I cannot remember the State right now, I just remember 
11 the venue, in a barn somewhere, that she went a couple weeks before election, and she 
12 did speak. 
13 But by and large, she didn't do much with the reelection. We declined most of 
14 the things they requested. 
15 Q Yeah. You're anticipating my next question. Did she do some things 
16 independent of her husband, or was she generally someone who would join him for 
17 events? 
18 
19 
20 A 
Q 
A Independent campaign-wise? 
Yes. Like her making an appearance herself. 
She did one or two. Again, one of them was in a barn somewhere that I'm 
21 trying to remember. And then she did show up with him for a couple of events, but 
22 those were generally done. She would decline, and then the President would ask her 
23 personally at home, and then she would let me know that, okay, we're going to go. 
24 
25 Q 
A I see. 
Yeah. 8  1 
2 
3 Q 
A 
Q But only a couple of times where she was on her own separate from him? 
Very rare, yeah. Couple times. Very rare. 
Were you at any time briefed on polling numbers or how things looked in a 
4 particular State, strategic discussions about campaign strategy, that sort of thing? 
5 
6 A 
Q No. 
Okay. So your role was limited to facilitating her potential involvement in 
7 these handful of events? 
8 A Yeah. At that point, Mark Meadows had taken over as chief of staff, and 
9 we weren't the best of friends. 
10 Q I see. Did there come a time when that "not the best of friends" 
11 relationship happened, or was it always that way from the beginning? 
12 
13 A 
Q 
14 Meadows? 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Always that way from the very beginning. 
Okay. So you never had a close working relationship with Chief of Staff 
Absolutely not. 
Was there actual conflict between the two of you? 
Yes. 
Do you remember anything in particular that caused it? 
Oh, I mean, how much time do you guys have? No. 9 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 When he first came aboard, He had a lot 
21 of questions about how I had structured the teams, being that I was director of com ms 
22 and press secretary. 
23 He asked me to hire a couple of individuals, one of whom, Alyssa Farah, I was not 
24 comfortable hiring. 
25 He then got very angry with me when I went on the record for an Axios report,  10 
1 defending myself, saying I was going to be fired. And he told me he wanted to replace 
2 me as press secretary, but please stay on as director of com ms. 
3 I politely told him that wasn't going to work for me, and I was going to go back to 
4 Mrs. Trump, and it went downhill from there. 
5 
6 
7 Q 
A 
Q Got it. 
Which you would think it wouldn't have gone downhill anymore, but it did. 
Yeah. I see. So when he started as chief of staff, you were in the role of 
8 director of communications and press secretary. 
9 
10 
11 
12 A 
Q 
A 
Q Correct. 
And he replaced you with --
1 resigned. I resigned, yeah. 
Okay. I see. Later in the game, like during the campaign, or even 
13 post-election, were there specific conflicts that you had with Mr. Meadows, continuation 
14 of this tense relationship? 
15 A Yeah. I mean constantly. I don't know how it would be pertinent to this, 
16 but I will give it to you. 
17 Yeah, he accused me of leaking some stories. We went back and forth about 
18 that. We just had a really contentious relationship. 
19 
20 
21 Q 
A 
Q I see. Okay. Okay. It's never clear exactly what is or isn't pertinent. 
You're right, you're right. 
So I know it's a bit beyond what we talked about before. But I appreciate 
22 your indulgence there. 
23 
24 A 
Q Whatever you want. 
Was there anybody else like that in the White House with whom you had an 
25 acrimonious or contentious relationship? And, again, I'm talking about now that you're  11 
1 working with the First Lady, last year or so, or even post-election, of the administration. 
2 A Yeah, understood. I would say that I had a very --well, I wouldn't say 
3 acrimonious, but I stopped talking to --or they stopped talking to me --I could name 
4 many. Kayleigh, the new press secretary. Alyssa, the new director of communications. 
5 Dan Scavino. Peter Navarro. Jared and lvanka. They all --everybody kind of stopped 
6 talking to me once I went to the East Wing, and I was walled off from everything because 
7 I was branded a leaker, which is all you had to do in our White House to --
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
14 Kayleigh. 
15 Q I see. 
Yeah. 
So it sounds like not a lot of continued interaction with your successors -­
No. 
--communications or --
Actually, absolutely none. Not once did I speak with either Alyssa or 
I see. And the summary of the root of this was their suspicion or allegation 
16 that you had leaked --
17 A Meadows. Well, it was Meadows. Yeah, he --you know, I didn't serve the 
18 President well, I had leaked the bunker story. Yeah, people that I was close to, Dan 
19 Scavino, they stopped talking to me. You know, it's just kind of how it ended. 
20 Q Yeah. When you say the bunker story, is that the story that the President 
21 was relocated to the secure bunker during the summer of 2020 --
22 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A 
Q Yes, correct. 
--protest in Lafayette Square? 
Yes. 
Okay. It's been --I've seen reports that the President was very angry at -- 1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 A He was. He was very angry, yeah. 
Q And Meadows accused you of being the source of that story, the leaker? 
A Yes. Yes. 
Q I see. Okay. 
A 
Q And I was not, 1,000 percent I was not. 
Understood. Okay. All right. 12 
7 So it sounds, Ms. Grisham, to summarize, that you and the First Lady were sort of 
8 your own island over here in the East Wing, not very connected with the West Wing, the 
9 people closest to the President toward the end. Is that right? 
10 A Yeah, that's correct. I'm grabbing water. I'll just be right back. 
11 
12 Q Of course. 
A But, yes, that's absolutely correct. We did our own thing. Mrs. Trump 
13 was well aware of the things that Mark Meadows was doing. She didn't trust anybody 
14 at that point either. And we were having more and more reports of Rudy Giuliani and 
15 Jenna Ellis and Sidney coming in. And so Mrs. Trump just wanted to do her own thing 
16 and ignore the West Wing and work on her initiatives. 
17 Q Yeah. I'm going to get into some of the campaign lawyers, Giuliani and 
18 others. But tell me more about Mrs. Trump's distrust of folks in the West Wing. Does 
19 that go back prior to the election, that she had that kind of distrust? And I don't want to 
20 put words in your mouth, but --
21 
22 
23 
24 A Yeah. 
Q Who did she distrust and why prior --
A When we very first started in the White House? 
Q Yeah. Well, yeah, in your experience working with her, I'm really focused 
25 on the end of the last -- 13 
Okay. 
--few months of the administration. 1 
2 
3 A 
Q 
A She didn't trust Mark Meadows, was what she told me. She was very angry 
4 with him about his treatment and the things he was doing to me personally. 
5 She was very wary of Giuliani, Sidney Powell, Jenna Ellis, a lot of the people who 
6 were coming up into the residence and talking to the President. 
7 And then I think she was constantly wondering, and I know she got on the phone 
8 with Ronna a few times to kind of ask, like, where really are we with polling, because I 
9 don't think she fully trusted the campaign necessarily. 
10 Q Okay. Was her frustration with Meadows based on Meadows' treatment of 
11 you, Ms. Grisham, or were there other independent reasons why she had that distrust? 
12 A I know she was frustrated with his treatment of me, but I also know that she 
13 felt he was letting a lot of people who were maybe being harmful to the President, giving 
14 him bad advice. He was clearing them into the residence or getting them into the Oval. 
15 And Mrs. Trump never liked it when people would tell Trump what he wanted to 
16 hear rather than the truth or the reality of the situation, and she felt that Meadows was 
17 always just playing into his hand. 
18 Q Interesting. So Meadows would not be an effective screen or gatekeeper, 
19 but rather let people have contact with the President that told him what he wanted to 
20 hear? 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 stuff. A 
Q 
A 
Q Yes. 
That was Mrs. Trump's view? 
Yes. 
Okay. Let's talk a little bit more now about that, about election-related  14 
1 But let me actually stop here and see if Ms. Cheney or Mr. Aguilar, just sort of on 
2 the structural issues, if either of you have any questions. 
3 Ms. Cheney. Thanks, -
4 Ms. Cheney. I just wanted to ask, Ms. Grisham, so you mentioned Mrs. Trump 
5 being frustrated when people would show up in the residence. Do you have a 
6 recollection of particular times or moments when that happened? 
7 A So this is where I'm going to be the worst and most unhelpful person to you 
8 guys because I don't have specific dates or times. But she hated when people would 
9 come to the residence. It was --that was her home, she wanted privacy. 
10 So I do recall, towards the end, her telling me that there were constantly meetings 
11 happening in the Yellow Oval, which is the room up in the residence, with various people. 
12 And she was very upset because nobody would give her a heads-up and was she walking 
13 around in a robe, that type of a thing. 
14 But she never gave me specific names other than Sidney Powell, Giuliani, and 
15 campaign people. Those were her words. 
16 It sounds like, Ms. Grisham --I didn't mean to interrupt you, 
17 Ms. Cheney --but that was sort of post-election that that ramped up, that sort of 
18 unfettered access to the --
19 Ms. Cheney. Sorry,1111 Hold on. Sorry. 
20 But just so with respect to Jenna and to Giuliani and to Sidney Powell, did 
21 she --what were her concerns about them? 
22 
23 advice. 
24 
25 Ms. Grisham. Those were people that she thought were giving her husband bad 
Ms. Cheney. And did she say what kind of bad advice? 
Grisham. She never talked about the advice, and, in fact, I don't know that she  15 
1 was sitting in on meetings often. But from --after the meetings, from some of the 
2 things that the President would then say to her, which I do not have specifics on, she 
3 would say, I think they're giving him bad advice, I don't think this is smart. 
4 Ms. Cheney. And did she say what it was that she didn't think was smart? 
5 Grisham. No. I have no specifics there. Just she was just always frustrated 
6 that those certain people were let up into the residence, because during the day, while a 
7 lot of people were let around him during the day, it was at night where I think --he was a 
8 night owl, people would come up, there was no vetting. Sometimes a chief of staff 
9 wouldn't know. And almost anyone could be up there and tell him something. 
10 And if it was things he liked to hear, he would then start to react the next day 
11 based on that, and she never liked that. 
12 Ms. Cheney. Okay. Thank you. 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 Ms. Grisham. Yes. 
Ms. Cheney. Thanks,. 
Yeah, thanks, Ms. Cheney. 
Mr. Aguilar, do you have anything on this? 
Mr. Aguilar. I don't have anything. Thanks, •. 
Okay. 
BY 
Q And just to follow up for a minute, Ms. Grisham, on Ms. Cheney's questions, 
21 it sounds like this issue, this problem of the access to the Yellow Oval, really became 
22 acutely a problem sort of post-election, the very last couple of months of your tenure. 
23 Is that fair to say? 
24 A I mean, with regard to Mrs. Trump, I will say it was throughout the time, 
25 because she just didn't like a lot of people up in her home.  16 
1 But towards the end, yes, it was more and more people going up into the 
2 residence. The business wasn't being conducted during the day and they would be 
3 there at all hours. And she would be pissed about that. 
4 Q Yeah, I understand. And when she put Mr. Giuliani and Jenna Ellis and 
5 Sidney Powell in the category of people giving the President bad advice, did she contrast 
6 that with people she believed were giving him good advice or were sort of on the other 
7 side of those discussions? 
8 A Not at that time, no. There didn't seem to be anybody pushing back. And 
9 that was one of her concerns, at least push back, at least look at another side. And it 
10 didn't seem at that time that anybody --Mark Meadows included --who would be 
11 offering him other advice. 
12 She really was always the pragmatic, more realistic, "give us the worst case 
13 scenario" type of a person, and nobody did that for him. 
14 Q Okay. Let's talk a little bit about election night. I think that's one of those 
15 nights when there is a crowd assembled in this Yellow Oval. 
16 Where were you, Ms. Grisham, overall on election night? 
17 A So overall on election night, I was on the State Floor. Mrs. Trump was 
18 upstairs in the residence, and so I was leaving her alone to do her thing. I had no reason 
19 to be in any of the other rooms with campaign people, Jason Miller, Justin Clark, 
20 et cetera. 
21 So for the most part, I was just on the floor. And then I went up to the residence 
22 when I knew he was about to give remarks. 
23 Q Okay. Tell me a little bit about where different gatherings were within the 
24 White House. My understanding is that there was sort of a team in the Map Room that 
25 was -- Uh-huh. 
--crunching numbers or assessing results. 
Yeah. 
Were you in there for any part of the night? 17 
1 
2 
3 
4 
5 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A I never walked into the Map Room, but there was a war room, they called it, 
6 in the Map Room down there where people were watching TVs. That was mostly 
7 campaign people, so you had Justin Clark, Jason Miller, and I don't know who else in 
8 there, because I never worked in that room. 
9 
10 Q 
A I see. You were more, you said, on the second floor? There was kind of --
1 was on the main floor, yes, where they had TVs and there were guests and 
11 people were watching. So I was up there watching the results come in with people and 
12 with my colleagues. 
13 Q Who do you recall being present, whether they were White House staff or 
14 folks from the outside, where you were on the second floor? 
15 A Okay. So Marcia Kelly was there, who at that time was working for the East 
16 Wing. I remember Boris Epshteyn was there. I remember the White House doctor was 
17 there, which for whatever reason, I love him, and I'm totally blanking on his name. 
18 Jenna Ellis was there. Rudy Giuliani was there. Hope Hicks was there. Most of the 
19 East Wing team was there. A man named Dr. Perelman was there, who was a guest of 
20 the family. 
21 And that's all I can kind of recall. I mean, it was a lot of friends, friends of the 
22 family, Don Jr., Kimberly, et cetera, friends of the family, and then official people. 
23 Q Yeah. Going into that night, did you have any clear expectation as to which 
24 way it was going to go, based on information you'd gotten from the campaign? 
25 A No.  18 
Didn't have a clear sense -- 1 
2 Q 
A Well, okay, according to --I'm sorry --I mean, according to the campaign, to 
3 everyone, we were going to win, but I was never given any hard numbers or anything to 
4 show one way or the other. 
5 Q I see. What about Mrs. Trump, had she ever shared with you, in advance of 
6 election night, her expectation, whether she had access to numbers or what she thought 
7 would happen? 
8 A No. At that time, in the beginning, Mrs. Trump just was like, well, we'll 
9 have to see what happens. At that time. 
10 Q Yeah. So at some point you said you went upstairs to the residence, is that 
11 right, where she was? 
12 A Yes. So I overheard that he was getting ready to give comments, and I sent 
13 her a few texts, and she wasn't answering. 
14 So I headed up to the residence. I walked into the residence from the main door, 
15 once you step off the elevator, and there were a bunch of people, I cannot remember 
16 everybody, but Justin Clark, all the kids, Don Jr., Eric, lvanka, Jared. I believe Hope Hicks. 
17 Kellyanne was there. 
18 There was just a crowd around him when I walked in, and they were all just kind of 
19 yelling, it was very chaotic, and he was standing in the middle. I couldn't hear what 
20 anybody was saying. He had papers in his hands, and he was very angry, I could tell. 
21 But I just walked straight to her bedroom door and knocked on the door and 
22 walked in. And that was the last I saw of that part. 
23 Q Yeah. Let me stop you there before you get to knocking on her door. 
24 
25 A 
Q Sure. 
Had FOX News made its projection about Arizona yet at the point that you  19 
1 went upstairs? 
I don't recall. I don't recall. 2 
3 A 
Q Do you remember what people were yelling about or the conversation with 
4 the President? 
5 A He was asking --he kept asking for numbers. He was telling people to call, 
6 call them, call them, but I don't have any names. And then there was different opinions 
7 about you need to go out there and address the country. We need to wait this out. 
8 But I don't know who was saying what. It was truly chaos. 
9 I mean, it was this group of people around him while he was angry. And when 
10 he was angry, I tried to disappear into the wall. So I beelined to the residence. 
11 
12 Q 
A So where was Mrs. Trump when you first got there? 
She was in her bedroom. I knocked on the door and I went in, and she was 
13 in her bed, and she was asleep. So I woke her up and said, hey, the President's about to 
14 make remarks, you need to get up so you can be there. 
15 She got up, she went to her dressing room, she started getting dressed. I sat at 
16 the end of her bed and watched some of the results come in, and I was kind of hollering 
17 at her what it was looking like. 
18 
19 Q 
A Okay. About what time was this, do you know? 
Hold on. I can look at my phone really quickly and I can tell you, because I 
20 did try to text her and warn her that I was coming up. Give me 2 seconds. She's easy 
21 to find. 
22 
23 
24 
25 Q 
A Yeah. 
I'm on January 5th right now, so give me 2 seconds here. 
You can ask me things while I'm looking if you want or --okay, okay. 
Q I believe that the FOX call on Arizona was around 11 p.m., so I'm wondering  1 where this might've taken place in relation to that. 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 A Sure. I'm getting there. 
Q Okay. 
A I'm at the beginning of December. 
Q When you knocked on the door, was she actually sleeping? 
A Yes. 
Q Was it your impression that you actually awakened her? 
A No, I did wake her up, for sure. It was dark in there, and I woke her up. 
Q Okay. 
A Yeah, she was definitely asleep. 
Q Yeah. And you probably don't have --
A I mean, at that point it was --I mean, it was pretty late at that point, so I 
13 didn't think anything of that, closing her eyes for a minute, but --
14 Q You said, Ms. Grisham, you had texted her from downstairs with no 
15 response. 
16 A Correct. Which is what made me go up to check on her, because she 
17 always responded immediately. 
18 I'm at November 9th, I'm almost there. 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 Q This is actually November 3rd. This is back a little bit. 
A No, I know. I said I'm almost there. 
Q All right. 
A Yeah. 
Q You're going backwards, I see. 
A I was just giving you an update. Yeah, I have to go backwards in all my 
25 texts with her. November 4th, 3rd. 20  21 
1 Okay. Here we go. At 12:30 I said, do you mind if I come up? She was awake. 
2 Hold on. She said, who is coming up? And I said, Biden is speaking in 4 minutes. 
3 And then the next time we talked was at 3 a.m. So it was between 12:30 and 
4 3 a.m. that I couldn't get a hold of her and I walked up there. 
5 
6 
7 Q 
A 
Q Okay. So sometime after 12:30 but before 3 when you woke her up? 
Correct. 
All right. So just walk us forward. You said she got dressed and was 
8 preparing to go downstairs for the President to issue some remarks? 
9 A Correct. I said, he's --we know Biden's about to speak, so now he's 
10 thinking about speaking, so you should get dressed so that you can take the stage with 
11 him. I sat with, like I said, at the end of her bed, with Barron actually, and we were 
12 watching the results come in. 
13 And I kept kind of shouting out what was happening. I don't remember what I 
14 shouted out, but I just kept shouting out to her updates. And she kept asking me, what 
15 is he going to say, which I had no idea. 
16 She finally got dressed. We went out into the residence where that crowd was 
17 still kind of around him. And at that point people --1 don't have names, I don't 
18 remember --it truly was just this group around him. It was hard to tell. And, again, he 
19 was angry, so I was trying to stay hidden. 
20 But they were telling him, you need to go out, and don't concede, don't concede. 
21 And at that point, that was my first point up in the residence that I started to say to 
22 Mrs. Trump, get in there, you need to make sure he has a level head. He doesn't maybe 
23 need to concede, but he can say, let's wait until the morning. 
24 
25 And she just stood back. She didn't get into the fray at all. 
Q Did you hear her give him any advice at any point about what he should say?  22 
1 A No. And that was very weird because she generally was very outspoken. 
2 But I do believe that it was because of the group that was there. It was a big group. 
3 Like I said, it was all the family, Pat Cipollone was there, you've got campaign people. 
4 I know she did put a lot of faith into Pat Cipollone to always give him good advice, 
5 so perhaps she was --this is me speculating --hoping that he would just be giving 
6 her --him good advice. 
7 But it was very odd because she just stood there. And I never got real aggressive 
8 with her, but that night there were two different times I got very aggressive with her, that 
9 she needed to go speak to her husband. 
10 Q And she did not, it sounds like. 
11 A She did not. It was very weird. 
12 Q Okay. It sounds, Ms. Grisham, like there were people giving the President 
13 conflicting advice --
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Yes. 
--about what he should say? 
Yes. 
Tell me more about that. 
And, again, he's --I mean, these are just snippets I'm hearing. He's like, 
19 make the call, make the call. You know, I think I heard him even say one time, call Sean. 
20 I think more of a, like, what's going on. You know, he kept yelling at his lawyers, like, 
21 what can we do? 
22 It was just --it was chaos. I can't explain it any other way. Some people were 
23 like, don't concede, some people were saying to him, just go out there and say, we'll see 
24 you in the morning. 
25 Q Who was in that category, saying, let's -- 23 
1 A I don't know. I really don't know. Again, I wish people could understand 
2 what that scene looked like. It was --the residence isn't huge, and so there were 
3 probably 15 to 20 people surrounding this man who has papers. I don't know what was 
4 on the papers. He's throwing them around. He's yelling. Everyone's talking over 
5 each other. You just couldn't --you couldn't tell. 
6 Q Yeah. Do you recall anyone suggesting that he should declare victory or say 
7 that the election was stolen? 
8 
9 A 
Q Not at that point, until we went downstairs, but not up in the residence. 
Okay. So when you went downstairs from the residence, did you have a 
10 clear sense as to what he might say, or was that still up in the air? 
11 A No. No, I had no idea. She had no idea. We got --it was time to go. 
12 They went into the elevator. The White House elevator, from the residence to 
13 downstairs, isn't big. So it was --I don't even know. I know it was the President, the 
14 First Lady, maybe a couple of the kids, and an agent. And then the rest of us, which, 
15 again, was probably 15 people, all ran down the stairs to get to the Green Room. 
16 By the time I made it into the Green Room he was once again surrounded, but 
17 now you've got Laura Ingraham, Judge Jeanine was in there, Boris Epshteyn was in there. 
18 There were more people in there adding their 10 cents. 
19 
20 
21 
22 Q 
A 
Q 
A People that had not been upstairs but were now in the Green Room? 
That is correct. 
How about Mr. Giuliani, was he either place? 
He was in the --that I saw --he was definitely in the Green Room. I don't 
23 remember seeing him in the residence, but he could've been. 
24 Q Do you remember him giving the President any advice about what he should 
25 say?  24 
1 A No. And, in fact, it's interesting because the one person who was the 
2 loudest was Boris Epshteyn, and he kept saying very loudly, you go out there and tell 
3 them it was stolen, go out there and say it was stolen. 
4 Q Did others agree with Mr. Epshtyn, in your observation, when he said that to 
5 the President? 
6 A No. At that time, Pat Cipollone and even Judge Jeanine, and I believe Eric 
7 and Don, also lvanka and Jared were all, like, whoa, whoa, whoa, just let's go out and say, 
8 there's still time, we need to do this count, we'll see you in the morning. 
9 You know, nobody ever said, go concede, but there were definitely differing 
10 opinions on if you say it was stolen or if you say we'll see you in the morning. 
11 
12 
13 Q 
A 
Q So it sounds like Mr. Epshteyn was saying, say it was stolen -­
Yes. 
--and everybody else was on the other side, saying, hey, no, it's too early, 
14 we have votes to count, we'll see you in the morning, something like that. 
15 
16 
17 
18 A 
Q 
A 
Q Yeah, yeah. Something around --yes. 
The consensus was different from what Mr. Epshteyn was advising? 
Yes. 
Did the President make a decision right there in the Green Room, or did you 
19 still not know until he took the stage what he was going to say? 
20 
21 
22 A 
Q 
A No one knew until he took the stage. 
How did he react to the various different advice he was getting in the --
1 mean, he just listened. He just --I mean, that was his way, when anybody 
23 did this, because he did enjoy this kind of thing. With a lot of people around, he would 
24 just look at people and listen and nod. 
25 Q All right. And do you remember --I'm going back to Mr. Giuliani --whether  25 
1 he was contributing to this discussion and in which direction? 
2 A I don't recall. It was --the Green Room's not so big, and it was a lot of 
3 people in there yelling. So it was just --and at that time, again, I was, like, please, 
4 Mrs. Trump, go up there and tell him to say we'll see what happens, not all the votes are 
5 in, please have --he's got to be Presidential. I kept begging her to do that. And, again, 
6 for whatever reason, she stayed in the background. It was very odd. 
7 
8 
9 Q 
A 
Q 
10 President? 
11 
12 A 
Q Yeah. 
She never did that, ever. 
And so that night you never saw or heard her contribute to this advice to the 
Ever. Never. And, again, I can't tell you how odd that was. 
Yeah. It sounds, Ms. Grisham, like your advice to her was that he should 
13 essentially say, it's too early to tell. 
14 
15 A 
Q Yeah. 
And you were on the side of, hey, it's too early, not on the side of go out 
16 there and say it was stolen. 
17 
18 A 
Q Correct, yeah. 
And did you get a sense as to Mrs. Trump having a particular perspective, or 
19 she didn't indicate which way she thought he should go? 
20 A She literally just stood there and said nothing. I mean, there was a point 
21 where I actually, like, pushed on her arm, which was so unlike me, but it was also so 
22 unlike her to be this quiet and not have a conversation. 
23 
24 
25 Q 
A 
Q Yeah. Okay. 
Yeah. 
So when the President actually went out to the podium, did you go out into  26 
1 that area as well with the rest of the group? 
2 A No. I stayed in the Blue Room because at that point, I, personally, just as 
3 someone who'd been around for so long, I was pissed at Mrs. Trump for not trying to give 
4 him good advice. I was angry that more people weren't trying to say, what are you 
5 going to say, or helping --I was just angry at the way he was being served in that 
6 moment. So I went into the Blue Room. There's a TV. I could hear everything he was 
7 saying. But I sat on the couch in the Blue Room. 
8 Q Did you have the kind of relationship with him, with President Trump, where 
9 you could have credibly contributed to this or --I know that wasn't your role as part of 
10 the --
11 
12 A 
Q 
13 yourself? 
14 A Yeah. 
--West Wing communications shop. But did you ever consider weighing in 
No. Only because by that point Mark Meadows had really shut me out. 
15 Prior to Mark Meadows, yeah, I would've absolutely said something. 
16 Q Okay. So the President, when he actually took the podium, said, "This is a 
17 fraud on the American public. This is an embarrassment to our country. We were 
18 getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election. We did win this 
19 election. This is a major fraud in our Nation." 
20 
21 
22 
23 You remember him saying those words? 
A 
Q 
A I do. 
And what was your reaction? 
To be honest with you, I was sitting, like I said, on the couch in the Blue 
24 Room, and I started to cry, because I was so ashamed and pissed off that that is what he 
25 chose to say and --yeah, I was just --I was just so upset.  27 
Yeah. Tell me more about that. Why? 1 
2 Q 
A Because it would've been so much easier to just say, let's see what happens 
3 in the morning. And in the morning, if you wanted to say it was stolen, perhaps if you 
4 had --but, you know, as usual he just kind of spoke off the cuff. And it wasn't 
5 Presidential, and it wasn't good for our country. 
6 And I had just watched for the last 2 hours this yelling, chaos, where nobody was, 
7 like, bothering to try to put some points together or give him some halfway cogent advice 
8 and I was just pissed off. I was pissed off for the country, and I was pissed off at 
9 everybody who had been allowed to surround him at that point. 
10 Q Yeah. I see. Interesting. 
11 There had been reports even before election night, Ms. Grisham --and I'm 
12 speaking specifically about an article in Axios that Jonathan Swan wrote --that indicate 
13 there had been discussions in the campaign regarding whether or not the President 
14 should declare victory if it looked like he was ahead, even if the election had not been 
15 called and there was a substantial number of ballots left to be counted, that this may 
16 have been even a strategy or a plan that was discussed prior to election day. 
17 Were you familiar with any of that discussion prior to election night? 
18 
19 A 
Q No. No. 
Okay. Okay. 
20 So after the President gave his speech, tell us sort of how the night ended or if it 
21 did after that. 
22 A So actually, after he gave his speech, he walked --because they gave the 
23 speech --I don't remember if it was the East Room or the State Dining Room. Either 
24 way, they walked directly into the Green Room. And the minute he got into the Green 
25 Room, I was still in the Blue Room, but the two doors were open, and I heard him  28 
1 immediately screaming for his lawyers. He said, where's Pat, where's Pat Cipollone? 
2 And I heard people going, Pat, Pat, Pat. And then they all started to walk from 
3 the Green Room. So you'd have to go from the Green Room to the Blue Room to the 
4 Red Room to the elevator to go back up. 
5 And so they started to walk into the Blue Room. And, again, I had been on the 
6 couch, and I had been crying, and I was just --I was pissed at everybody, including my 
7 President. And so I remember, I actually had my head in my hands, and I was facing the 
8 other wall, hoping nobody would see me, and they all walked past me and headed up to 
9 the residence. 
10 And I don't know who went up to the residence. Obviously I couldn't see, 
11 because I was in --at that point, I was just done with what I had seen, and I was really 
12 ashamed of how we were leaving our country hanging like that. 
13 
14 Q 
A Did you speak to Mrs. Trump after --
She sent me a text that said, headed upstairs, are you okay, because she saw 
15 me sitting there. And I didn't speak to her again that night. 
16 
17 
18 Q 
A 
Q I see. So no further contact with her, didn't go to the residence, anything? 
No. No. I went home. 
Okay. There's been reports that a lot of the people that you've described 
19 were drinking over the course of the night. What was your impression as to, at this 
20 point, if people had been --if anyone was intoxicated, overserved, anything like that? 
21 A Sure. I don't know. I mean, I was accused of being drunk that night 
22 myself. 
23 So there was definitely alcohol being served. I, myself, had had a couple glasses 
24 of wine, absolutely. I don't remember seeing anybody overserved, but also that wasn't 
25 kind of my job, was to look for who was --you know. But there was alcohol being  29 
1 served. I don't know. I don't know who was drinking. 
Q No, no, and I appreciate that. 
A Yeah. 2 
3 
4 Q It sounds like nothing stuck out to you as a person being overserved or being 
5 intoxicated --
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q No. 
--to the point --
No. 
Okay. 
Nothing that I saw. 
I see. Okay. All right. 
12 Anything else you remember about election night before we move on to 
13 something else? 
14 
15 
16 A No. 
Q Any other conversation or moment that sticks out? 
A No. I mean, honestly, people were very excited at the beginning, and then 
17 it turned and people got --started to get very upset. But I don't recall anything else 
18 right now. 
19 Q Okay. 
20 Ms. Cheney or Mr. Aguilar, do you have any questions about those 
21 events before we keep going? 
22 
23 
24 Ms. Cheney. I don't. Thanks,. 
BY 
Q Okay. All right. Let's talk then, Ms. Grisham, a little bit about after 
25 election day. A few days later the networks declare that the election has gone to  30 
1 President-elect Biden. I think that happens on Saturday after the Tuesday night of 
2 election day. 
3 Tell me a little bit more about your interaction with Mrs. Trump about the election 
4 after the race has been called for President Biden. 
5 A Yeah. So I'm scrolling again, because apparently if you let your iPhone go 
6 black you can't stay where you were. 
7 In general, she was --she started packing. I mean, she started preparing to 
8 leave. She started selecting what things she wanted to take with her. She started 
9 working with the photo office to get a bunch of photo albums made. She was definitely 
10 very business as usual. 
11 She instructed me, which I'm going to try to find, but she wanted to ask about are 
12 we going to do an event --I don't remember --for a holiday, but with the West Wing. 
13 And she was very much like even though we're leaving, it's business as usual. We still 
14 need to go visit Arlington Cemetery. That's me just --I'm trying to find the actual event. 
15 But in the beginning she was definitely very, you know, I'm going to pack up, it's time to 
16 go. Yeah. 
17 
18 Q 
A You say in the beginning. Did that change over time? 
Yes. Yeah. And this was more talks on the telephone. But I have to --I 
19 just want to stress that Mrs. Trump was always very pragmatic and always very --not 
20 suspicious, but she questioned everything. And she didn't buy into a lot of the 
21 conspiracy theories or even some of the things her husband would say. 
22 And as time moved along, there were telephone calls that we had, and she would 
23 say things like, well, something's not right, something here went wrong. 
24 
25 Q 
A Pertaining to the election? 
To the election, questioning the election. And that always shocked me,  31 
1 because now here I've known her for 4 years, very close. She's never been one to be 
2 kind of a conspiracy theory type of a person, and suddenly she was like, well, we'll see 
3 what happens. 
4 The next thing that happened that made me really kind of --something perked up 
5 was that, again, she would have invited Jill Biden for tea because that would've been the 
6 proper thing to do. That was who she was. She was a rule-follower. She was very 
7 big into tradition. 
8 And I said, when would you like me to reach out to Jill Biden's people to at least 
9 get the conversation started about transition, et cetera? And she said, ask the West 
10 Wing. 
11 And in my whole time, it was always "F" the West Wing. I mean, we never cared 
12 what the West Wing thought. So that was very weird. 
13 And then I said, well, they're not doing anything. She said, well, we will wait 
14 until the West Wing does something. 
15 
16 Q 
A Yeah. 
And that just --that was very weird, very weird. And that is when --this is 
17 me speculating --I started to wonder what's going on up in that residence, what is she 
18 hearing, who is talking to them, to make her start thinking this way. 
19 Q Yeah. You mentioned earlier that she initially expressed some skepticism 
20 about conspiracy theories or some of the things that she was hearing. Do you 
21 remember anything in particular that she said that she didn't believe, a theory or an 
22 allegation that she explicitly told you she thought was not credible? 
23 A No. Now that you've given me that question, I can certainly think on it. 
24 But, again, she was just very pragmatic. She would say, like, Charlottesville, he shouldn't 
25 have said that, or he shouldn't be stoking this, this immigration stuff. And she very  1 much disagreed, again, with the kids in cages type thing. So in those regard, she was 
2 just very realistic, always. 
3 Q Yeah. When did she start --you said she started packing. I mean, she 
4 started preparing to move to Florida. Did that happen pretty much immediately after 
5 election night? 
6 
7 
8 A 
Q 
A Yes. Yeah, yes. 
Did she look for schools for her son, for example, in Florida? 
Yeah, she started to look for schools for Barron. But mostly it was about 
9 just getting photographs catalogued. Again, she had the White House photo office 
10 going double time. She told me to tell the photo office to give --so we had a 32 
11 photographer, Andrea Hanks. She said, give Andrea --you tell them to give Andrea any 
12 support she needs, I want all of these photographs. 
13 So, yeah, she absolutely started to go into moving things into storage, what should 
14 go to Trump Tower and what will go to Florida. 
15 
16 
17 Q Okay. So she started packing belongings right away? 
A Yes, yes. 
Q Okay. Did you ever hear her explicitly acknowledge that her husband had 
18 lost the election? 
19 A No. You know, prior --again, prior to election night it was we'll see what 
20 happens and people will make the decision. And then on November 12th --I'm looking 
21 right now --which I don't know if I sent this to you or not --
22 Q Before you go there, you sent us some text messages, which I really 
23 appreciate, about it sounds like you may have additional ones, Ms. Grisham. 
24 
25 A Yeah. Okay. 
Q So to the extent --this is all voluntary, and we appreciate it, but all of your  1 text exchanges --
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 A With her? 
Q With her, with anyone else in the White House, or any from the campaign. 
A 
Q 
A Between what dates? Can you get, like, between -­
Election day to the end would be very helpful. 
Okay. Election to January. Okay. 
Q And I should say election-related, with people, campaign, people in the 
8 White House, with Mrs. Trump. Anything during that period would be helpful. 
9 A Okay. So November 12th, she's asking me to do remarks for a Noguchi 33 
10 unveiling in the Rose Garden. And then somebody asked me from the Daily Mail, what 
11 does Mrs. Trump think, which I'll send this to you. 
12 
13 Q Okay. 
A And this is --I think I sent this to you, but it says, "Mrs. Trump believes the 
14 American people deserve fair elections. Only legal votes should be counted." And, 
15 again, that was not her. That was not her language. As somebody was --I just, 
16 knowing her the way I do, and I have no facts, but the fact that she suddenly was, like, 
17 legal votes being counted, I kept thinking, who in the hell is going upstairs and talking to 
18 them? 
19 Q Let me show you, you did send us, this is exhibit 1, and I'm going to put it on 
20 the screen so you can see it. 
21 
22 A Oh, good. 
Q Let's start,_ with exhibit 1. 
23 And this, Ms. Grisham, just to be clear, is a text that you provided to us just last 
24 week. 
25 A Yes.  1 
2 Q And is this the November 12th thread that you were just describing? 
A Yeah. That's her saying, "I can retweet this and ... say American people," 
3 and then you'll see, I rewrite it to just give it proper English. 
4 But that was very weird to me. "Every legal, but not illegal, vote needs to be 
5 counted. We must protect our democracy." That's not her. 
Q Okay. 34 
6 
7 A That just wasn't her. I'd never heard her ever, ever say anything even close 
8 to that before. 
9 
10 Q So this looks like she sends you that draft --
A That's her. She's saying, I can retweet this CNN thing and say this. And 
11 then I --
12 
13 
14 Q And then --I'm sorry. Go ahead. 
A Oh, and then I copy and pasted it, and I just rewrote it for proper English. 
Q The CNN piece that she sends you says, "First Lady Melania Trump is among 
15 those telling President Trump to accept the election loss." 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 A Yeah. 
Q Do you remember ever discussing with her whether he should do that --
A No. 
Q --accept the election loss? 
A No, never. 
Q Okay. 
A I don't know where CNN got that. I never did know where CNN got that. 
Q So you get that from her, and then essentially add a couple of lines at the 
24 end. You add, "with complete transparency," to, "We must protect our democracy," if 
25 we scroll down.  1 
2 
3 A Yes. Yeah. 
Q You're essentially kind of --
A I'm trying to soften it a bit for her because I don't --you know, look, 
4 transparency is always a good thing, right? So I was just trying to soften it a bit for her 
5 so that we weren't inferring that there were a bunch of illegal votes being cast. 35 
6 Q Got it. And then she responds with the same statement, just what you had 
7 recommended. 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 A Correct. 
Q Saying, "Not retweeting CNN." 
A Correct. 
Q "Will post this. Anything to add?" 
A Correct. 
Q And she did, in fact, if we look at exhibit 2, I believe that is the very same 
14 tweet that she posts. 
15 
16 A Yeah. 
Q - if you could pull up exhibit 2 just to --let's just confirm that --it's 
17 actually November 8th, not November 12th, according to the tweet. 
18 She then tweets, Ms. Grisham, "The American people deserve fair elections. 
19 Every legal --not illegal --vote should be counted. We must protect our democracy 
20 with complete transparency." That's exactly the language from the text chain we just 
21 looked at. 
22 
23 
24 
25 A Yes. Yes. 
Q And it's dated Sunday, November 8th, at 1:45 p.m. 
A Correct, correct. 
Q All right. And, again, you don't recall --do you ever recall discussions with  36 
1 her about whether or not the President should concede, the President should move on, 
2 anything along those lines? 
3 A The only other thing I remember is her saying to me --and this was verbally, 
4 so I'm paraphrasing- --but she kept saying, something's not right, something's not right. 
5 And, again, that just shocked me. Knowing her the way I know her, having her suddenly 
6 buy into the notion that the election was stolen, I just kept wondering, like, who has been 
7 on the phone with them? 
8 Because they definitely would get on the phone. They would call me all the 
9 time. The President would call me all the time and then throw her on speaker. 
10 So he did that a lot. He would be on phone calls all the time and Mrs. Trump 
11 would either be in the room listening or whatnot. So I kept wondering, like, who is she 
12 listening to on the phone, or who was up in that residence making her believe these 
13 things? Because it is, in 4 years, something I never, ever, ever would've expected from 
14 her. 
15 Q I think you indicated that the language in that tweet that we just looked at 
16 didn't sound like her. Do you have any idea where it came from? Did she ever tell 
17 you --
18 
19 
20 A No. 
Q --somebody else drafted that for her? 
A No, she didn't. I had a feeling that the President had said something, only 
21 because she had clearly written it, I just know her language and the way she writes things 
22 at that point. But I --no, I don't know that for a fact. 
23 Q Okay. And just to go back to what you said earlier, you could just do this, 
24 she could just post this, you and Mrs. Trump could independently decide to say --
25 A Yep.  --anything without having to -­
Yes. 
--go through anyone? 
A thousand percent. 37 
1 
2 
3 
4 
5 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q And so that tweet, that November 8th tweet, you didn't need clearance, you 
6 just went ahead --she just went ahead and sent it. 
7 
8 A 
Q Yes. 
Okay. Did she ever talk to you about discussions she had with her husband 
9 about the move to Florida, about the schools for Barron, about moving things, the stuff 
10 that you just described she was doing? 
11 A No. I mean, she talked to me about what she was doing. Again, I mean, 
12 she's --what should go to storage. I mean, that was part of my job as chief of staff, is to 
13 make sure that the things she wanted done were being done. But a lot of that also fell 
14 to Timothy Harleth, who was the chief usher. 
15 But she never talked to me about the President. 
16 I will say, I know a lot of times they would do things and move things when he was 
17 either in the Oval or traveling. 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Why? 
So that he wouldn't see boxes or things being moved. 
I see. 
He hadn't yet accepted that it was time to go. 
How do you know that, Ms. Grisham, that they waited for him to be gone 
23 before moving some stuff into the elevator or out of the residence? Did she tell you 
24 that? 
25 A She didn't say that to me explicitly, but, I mean, I just knew because he was  38 
1 never there. That was just --that was often the way we worked with him, around him. 
2 Q Okay. What, if anything, do you know about the President's personal 
3 attitude about people saying that they were looking for jobs or they were moving on? 
4 Was there any sense in the White House that that was or was not okay? 
5 A It was my understanding that if anybody was looking for jobs it was kept very 
6 secret. That was never talked about openly. 
7 Q Why not? 
8 A Because he didn't believe that we were going to be leaving. 
9 Q Okay. We have developed some information that he actually made a 
10 couple of job offers to some of his White House staff to move to Florida, that Molly 
11 Michael, for example, in November, was offered a position in Florida, working for the 
12 President down there. 
13 Did you ever hear any discussion of that, of him offering people positions for his 
14 post-Presidency professional endeavors? 
15 
16 A 
Q No, I didn't. 
Okay. It sounds like the opposite. Your sense was that people shouldn't 
17 be openly looking? 
18 A Not that --just people were afraid to openly be looking for jobs because that 
19 would be admitting defeat. 
20 
21 
22 
23 to us. Q 
A 
Q Got it. 
Yeah. 
Let me show you exhibit 3. This is another text exchange that you provided 
24 - if you could put that on the screen. 
25 So on this topic, this is another exchange you had with Mrs. Trump where it looks  1 like you're --she is --I think actually you are sending to Mrs. Trump a Jonathan Karl 
2 article, which I'm assuming is about Alyssa Farah looking for another position. 
A Yeah. 3 
4 Q You send another tweet from Jacqui Heinrich. And then you say, "This is 
5 the one I told Meadows I wouldn't hire. That she leaks and isn't loyal .. and he told me 
6 tough shit." 
7 Can you talk to about this exchange with Mrs. Trump? 
8 [Laughter.] 
9 A Sorry, I don't mean to laugh. 
10 So that kind of goes back to what I was telling you in the beginning when I was 
11 press secretary, and then when Meadows came in he said to me, you need to hire X, Y, 
12 and Z. Alyssa was one of them. I said, no, I am not comfortable hiring her, I don't 
13 know her. But my team does not want her, and I've got really good morale right now. 
14 And so I always shared with Mrs. Trump kind of the shenanigans that Meadows 
15 was pulling with me. And she wasn't really happy with the new press secretary and 
16 director of comms that were brought in under Meadows. 
17 Q Tell me more about that. What did Mrs. Trump say about Kayleigh 
18 McEnany and Alyssa Farah? 
19 
20 A She just wasn't pleased with the way that Meadows went about it. You 
know, I was, again, and he didn't take the time to 39 
21 understand why I had built the team the way I had. And despite the fact that I had said I 
22 would do press briefings if he wanted, he had a team he wanted involved. And she 
23 wasn't happy because she felt that, once again, we were going to have this big turnover in 
24 the West Wing and that wouldn't be a good look for her husband. 
25 Q Okay.  40 
1 A So when those things came out, I sent them to her, that was more me 
2 sending stuff to my friend, like, see, look at this, like, these people are looking out for 
3 themselves, et cetera, and I'm being screwed over. That was more me just talking to my 
4 friend --who I thought was my friend. 
5 Q I understand. And it sounds like what prompted you to send this to 
6 Mrs. Trump is a report that Alyssa Farah is actively looking for a post-administration job, 
7 interviewing with agents, that's what prompts you --
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 lines. A 
Q 
A 
Q Yeah. 
--to reach out to Mrs. Trump? 
Yeah. 
Okay. The next one is exhibit 4. This is another text along these same 
13 _, if you could pull that up on the screen. 
14 This is some text messages again between you and Mrs. Trump about the prospect 
15 of reaching out to Jill Biden. And I think, Ms. Grisham, you said you raised this issue 
16 with her --here it is. "If Joe Biden's people reach out, what will you prefer I do?" The 
17 response from Mrs. Trump is, "Let me know if they do and then we decide." 
18 A Yeah. Because it was at that moment that GSA had finally given the 
19 light --the General Services, I think, Administration --they had given the green light for 
20 the transition. Because I don't know if you remember, but the transition green light 
21 wasn't given for quite a while. 
22 When it was finally determined that a transition was going to happen, again, I had 
23 been told not to reach out, and I was worried they would reach out to me. And so I was 
24 asking her, like, what is it you want me to do?  41 
1 
2 [3:00 p.m.] 
3 BY 
4 Q Yeah. If we scroll down, keep going on this text thread, 
5 ---yeah --you see the rest. 
6 You say, "You'll also want to consider if you want to reach out and invite her for 
7 the traditional tea tour. Just putting it on your radar." 
8 Her response, "We need to be on the same page with WW. If they invite him, I 
9 invite her." 
10 Explain to me what you took away from her direction here. 
11 A So I was trying to gently say to her --because, again, so often she did things 
12 no matter --independent of her husband, and she did what she felt was right. So I was 
13 trying to gently say, maybe we reach out and do this anyway. 
14 And, as you see, she said, "We need to be on the same page with West Wing." 
15 And, again, in my entire career in that White House, she never, ever, ever said 
16 that. It was always kind of an "F the West Wing" attitude. And so that's --you see I'm 
17 like, "I see. Ok," because I was flabbergasted. We had never gone along with the West 
18 Wing on anything. 
19 Q And does that, Ms. Grisham, go all the way back to your time with her in the 
20 very beginning, her attitude --
21 A Yes, absolutely. In fact, when I very first started my job with her, she 
22 said --I mean, she all but told me relinquish your ties with the West Wing, because of 
23 course I started out there. We're going to do our own thing. We aren't going to worry 
24 about them. We are going to do what I want, what I feel is right, and what they say 
25 doesn't matter.  42 
1 Q Why did --to the extent you know, if she ever explained it to you, why did 
2 she have that kind of desire to be separate from and independent of the West Wing? 
3 Did she explain her rationale? 
4 A No. She never did, but, I mean, she's just a very independent woman. 
5 She always has been. And she didn't agree with a lot of the President's policies. And 
6 she oftentimes didn't trust or like some of his staffers. 
7 And so she wanted her own East Wing office. She wanted her initiatives. She 
8 wanted to do what she wanted to do to help children. And she wasn't going to be told 
9 where to go, when to campaign. She very, as I said, she very rarely campaigned for him, 
10 because that wasn't her thing. That was his thing. 
11 And like I said, I wish I could put into words how odd it was at the end the way she 
12 suddenly started to defer to the West Wing. 
13 Q Yeah. It sounds like it was a real contrast --
14 
15 A 
Q It was an absolute 180. 
Yeah. You mentioned before the President's response to the 
16 Charlottesville violence and the child separation policy as things with which Mrs. Trump 
17 disagreed. 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Yeah. 
Were there other things like that that you recall where she -­
Yeah. 
Okay. 
LeBron James. He got into it with LeBron James over something. Because 
23 I think LeBron James had opened a school and said he would never have the President to 
24 visit. So then the President tweeted something about LeBron James. 
25 We then tweeted out that it looked like he was doing great things for children and  43 
1 that she would of course be happy to visit. He screamed at me over that one. 
2 But, yeah, she did things very independently all the time and didn't care. 
3 I was told to put out a statement about Rudy Giuliani when the Stormy Daniels 
4 news came out, and you have to remember --I think Rudy was at something, and he was 
5 like, Melania believes her husband. Of course she knows this is fake. 
6 And she said, you need to tell everybody that I have never talked to Rudy about 
7 anything. 
8 And so she was always very independent. I just --again, there's no way to say 
9 how much she did not care about the West Wing and pleasing them. 
10 Q Interesting. Okay. So understood that the change in attitude about 
11 coordinating with them at the end is very surprising. 
12 All right. And then, with respect to transition, you mentioned there was 
13 whatever the term is where the transition was sort of made officially possible. 
14 Did you or the First Lady take any steps --I understand she didn't meet with Jill 
15 Biden --but did you take any steps to sort of facilitate a transition once that green light 
16 was issued? 
17 
18 
19 A 
Q 
A With the new administration? 
Yes. 
I reached out through Twitter on a back channel myself to the person I knew 
20 would be Jill Biden's chief of staff. And I said, if you ever, ever have any questions or 
21 need anything, let me know. But I just thought I'd do that. 
22 
23 Q 
A About when did that occur, if you recall, roughly? 
Let's say end of November, early December maybe. And I just said, If there 
24 is anything I can help you with, please let me know. But it was very unofficial. 
25 Q Okay. Anything else that you remember between election day --and we're  44 
1 going to talk now about the lead-up to and the day of January 6th --anything else about 
2 the President or the First Lady's attitude about the election or about a possible 
3 transition? 
4 A I don't even know if you'll care, if this is helpful, but I do remember that the 
5 chief usher, Tim Harleth, he had been in contact with the Biden people and had 
6 actual --they had been requesting blueprints and stuff to start moving in and what the 
7 normal stuff that you would do. And he wasn't really allowed to talk to them. 
8 So he independently reached out to the Biden people and actually drove a big 
9 binder of just kind of how things work in the White House, blueprints so that they could 
10 order furniture if they wanted, et cetera, et cetera. 
11 And he showed up there, and it got back to the White House because Secret 
12 Service was there. Biden had that Secret Service protection at the time. And the 
13 President and Mark Meadows wanted to fire him immediately for trying to facilitate that 
14 kind of a transition. And Mrs. Trump actually stepped in and said, no, you're not going 
15 to fire him with 3 weeks to go. 
16 But that definitely happened. 
17 Q I see. Interesting. So there was clearly a climate of this is not over, don't 
18 look forward to a transition, that that wasn't going to happen. 
19 A Yeah. Yeah. They felt that what Tim did was completely disloyal, and 
20 they were not to help at all or he was not to help at all, and he was almost fired over it. 
21 Q Do you remember any other discussions, Ms. Grisham, about firings, either 
22 firings that occurred or firings that were discussed for this same reason, this sort of lack of 
23 loyalty? 
24 
25 A 
Q No. Not that I can think of. 
Okay.  Ms. Cheney, I see that you've come off of mute. Go ahead. 1 
2 Ms. Cheney. Thank you. 
3 I just wanted to ask, Ms. Grisham, how did you learn that they were angry that 
4 this outreach and facilitation, which goes on in every administration, how did you learn 
5 that that anger --
6 Ms. Grisham. Mrs. Trump. She called me, and she told me the story, and she 45 
7 said that Mark had called them and had them both on the phone on speaker --again, they 
8 love to do that --and he said, I'm going to fire him right now. And the President was 
9 really upset. 
10 And Mrs. Trump said, no, there's 3 weeks left, 4 weeks left, we're not --no, you're 
11 not going to fire him. 
12 She was more concerned about if --you know, you have to remember, the chief 
13 usher, as you probably know very well, they know a lot of intimate facts about the family. 
14 So I think Mrs. Trump was like, we're not going to fire this guy, and who knows what he's 
15 going to say about us. 
16 So she kept him on. But Meadows was ready to fire him that day. And 
17 Mrs. Trump told me that. 
18 Ms. Cheney. Okay. Thank you. And so you said there's 3 or 4 weeks left. 
19 I'm sorry. Just tell us the date again when this happened, when you spoke --
20 Ms. Grisham. I don't remember. I mean, I would have to say --I really don't 
21 remember. It would have had to be maybe in the beginningish of December. I can 
22 remember I was in a car and pulled over at a rest stop, but I can't remember the date. 
23 can try to find it if it's helpful. 
24 
25 Ms. Cheney. Okay. Thank you. Appreciate that. 
Ms. Grisham. Of course.  46 
1 And now I think Mr. Aguilar has dropped off. 
2 BY 
3 Q Let me ask you now, Ms. Grisham, a little bit about the lead-up to 
4 January 6th. 
5 When did you first hear, if you remember, that there was going to be some sort of 
6 a rally in D.C. on that date? 
7 A I don't know. I don't remember. I just remember --honestly, it was more 
8 from the news, right, that this was building and that there was going to be some kind of a 
9 rally. I'm sure at some point someone reached out to me to see if Mrs. Trump would 
10 speak. She declined. 
11 Q Do you remember that specifically, her being asked to attend or speak, and 
12 her declining? 
13 A I believe it was Justin Caporale, who worked for the campaign at the time, 
14 and we were very, very good friends. And so I believe he just got on the phone with me, 
15 because I wasn't close really with the leadership in the campaign at the time. He got on 
16 the phone with me, and I don't know --I don't remember the date. 
17 
18 
19 Q 
A 
Q Okay. 
But he did ask is that something she would do, and she declined. 
Understood. The first time the President himself mentions January 6th is in 
20 a tweet that says, "Big protest in D.C., will be wild!" And it is issued on December the 
21 19th. 
22 Do you remember seeing this? I think he actually attaches the Navarro --a 
23 Navarro report on election fraud and is essentially telling the world, hey, there is going to 
24 be this wild protest in D.C. 
25 Do you remember that?  47 
1 A I don't remember that. By that point, I was extremely walled off from the 
2 West Wing due to the Meadows thing, and Mrs. Trump had started to, again, be very, 
3 like, maybe buying into the election being stolen. And so I was doing my job, but I was 
4 definitely kind of zoned out. 
5 Q I understand. 
6 That tweet is issued in the middle of the night after what has been reported to be 
7 a very contentious meeting in the White House where Sidney Powell and General Flynn 
8 and Patrick Byrne all are present in the residence talking about --
9 
10 
11 
12 A 
Q 
A 
Q Wait. In the residence or the Oval? 
Well, it's both. It starts in the Oval and then -­
Okay. 
--moves to the residence. 
13 Do you recall hearing from Mrs. Trump or any other source about the 
14 December 18th, that Friday night into Saturday morning meeting? 
15 A No. But I was going to say I'm sure that's what happened. I'm sure --if it 
16 was in the Oval, someone then called him and talked him into tweeting that. 
17 But, no, Mrs. Trump did not talk to me about any of that. 
18 
19 
20 Q 
A 
Q Understood. And that tweet, again, no specific recollection of it? 
No. No. 
How about leading up to January 6th? Did you ever hear from Mrs. Trump 
21 or any other source sort of what the expectations were, what was going to happen, what 
22 the plan was other than a rally? 
23 A No. I had no details on the plan. She talked to me about a rally. She 
24 had been asked to speak. She declined. 
25 I do remember vaguely her saying that there is going to be a rally and all these  1 crazy people are telling him to do this rally, I want no part of it. 
2 But, other than that, I don't --yeah, I don't have any details. 
3 
4 Q Crazy people? Tell me what you --what that --
A She did not --no, no, no. She didn't give me who the crazy people were. 
5 can tell you because I know her. She was talking, again, about Sidney Powell and 48 
6 Giuliani and Jenna Ellis and Boris and a lot of the people who were really pushing him on 
7 the fact that this thing had been stolen. But she never said names. 
8 Q Okay. There is a lot of discussion about people who might speak at this 
9 rally, and that includes people like Roger Stone and Alex Jones and Ali Alexander. 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 A Uh-huh. 
Q Did you ever discuss with Mrs. Trump sharing a stage with them or their --
A No. 
Q --people like that, their involvement? 
A No. 
Q Okay. 
A She said no before she even knew who would be speaking. 
Q All right. 
A She just said no. And that's where --you know, I don't know if you 
19 remember the first time we spoke. I can tell you exactly logistically how these things 
20 come together and who could have known what and who could have done what. But I 
21 had absolutely no involvement in or knowledge of that rally, because she said no very 
22 early on. 
23 
24 
25 Q I see. And, therefore, this was not part of your responsibility --
A Yeah. 
Q --this meeting?  49 
1 A Nothing --yeah, yeah, nothing. They didn't even --I mean, it was out on 
2 the --wherever it was, they would have had to go through the National Park Service. It 
3 wasn't like it was on the South Lawn, which is where the East Wing would have had 
4 control. So there was nothing at all that we did. 
5 Q Yeah. I understand. 
6 So it sounds like, then, you didn't hear anything about possible threats of violence 
7 or protest activity that could turn violent. Did you have any indication in advance of 
8 that kind of activity? 
9 A Just --I mean, just things from the news, right? Just hearing about it from 
10 the news. I, Stephanie, from doing this for so long, knew that it wasn't going to turn out 
11 well, but I never heard of, like, Secret Service warnings or anything like that. 
12 
13 
14 Q 
A 
Q Okay. 
Yeah. 
Did you ever hear any discussion in advance of the 6th about the possibility 
15 of the President going to the Capitol, either walking or driving himself to the Capitol? 
16 A So I never --again, I never heard any of that. I know, because I did advance 
17 for a huge part of my career, that if that was something that could possibly happen, it 
18 would have been talked about. It would have been discussed. The campaign 
19 operations person, as well as Tony Ornate, would have discussed it. Secret Service 
20 would have come up with contingency plans. 
21 That is how advance works. They prepare for either we're going to do it or we're 
22 not. Somebody briefed him. I don't know who. But I just, again, I know how it 
23 works. So somebody briefed him, whether it was his body man or Tony Ornate or the 
24 campaign operations person, and said --you know, they said, you can go out and talk. 
25 They're going to march. If you decide you want to march, sure, you can.  50 
1 Secret Service could have jumped in and said, no, you're not going to march. 
2 But then, at that point, the President would have said, we're going to march. 
3 just know him. 
4 But I have no knowledge of it. 
5 Q 
6 specific --
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Okay. It sounds like what you're describing is a general process, nothing 
Yes. 
--to this actual -­
Correct. 
Okay. 
But it is a process that is tried and true and happens every single time. 
Yeah. Did the President do a lot of OTRs, where he would sort of 
13 spontaneously decide to go somewhere that hadn't been fully vetted or planned by 
14 Secret Service? 
15 A Every now and again he would want to get out and wave to people. If 
16 there was a big crowd or there were people who couldn't get into rallies, he would ask to 
17 be able to do that. But he did always listen to Secret Service if they told him yes or no. 
18 Q Okay. All right. Did anyone --did you ever hear anyone --Mrs. Trump or 
19 others --express concerns about January 6th, worry that something bad might happen? 
20 
21 A 
Q No. 
And I think you mentioned, in this period of time the First Lady expressed 
22 some concern about the people that were getting access to the President. 
23 
24 A 
Q Yes. 
Tell me again, if you recall, besides the lawyers that you mentioned, Powell 
25 and Ellis and Giuliani -- 1 
2 A 
Q 51 
I mean --
--anyone else who was in that category. 
3 A She didn't trust the campaign at that point. She thought Justin, Jason, all of 
4 them are just telling him what he wants to hear. And she didn't trust that they were 
5 doing things for the right reasons, because they, of course, still wanted to be getting paid 
6 and stay in his good graces. 
7 But then, on the other hand, there were days when she was like, something's not 
8 right. So somebody convinced her. I don't know who. 
9 Q Yeah. I'm just wondering if she mentioned anyone else of whom --in 
10 whom she was suspicious besides those that you've mentioned. 
11 A Yeah. She never fully trusted those people that I just mentioned. So just 
12 to be clear, Rudy, Jenna, Sidney Powell, Jason Miller, Justin Clark --she didn't know him 
13 that well, but she just wasn't sure who he was or how he had gotten to where he was. 
14 And then certainly when it came to the kids, especially Don Jr. and 
15 Kimberly Guilfoyle, she never trusted that they were doing things in the best interest of 
16 their --Don Jr.'s father. 
17 
18 
19 Q 
A 
Q Got it. 
Yeah. 
Did she ever mention anything about money, about fundraising, about "stop 
20 the steal" messaging as a sort of revenue generator? 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A 
Q No. 
Did she ever say anything about that? 
No. 
Okay. Let's talk about the day of January 6th. 
Now, you weren't working in the White House that day. You were working from  52 
1 home. Is that right? 
A Correct. Yeah. The whole East Wing was telecommuting. 
Q Yeah. Tell me more. Was that a COVID-related --2 
3 
4 A COVID. Yeah. We were all telecommuting because of COVID. She was 
5 very, very strict about that. 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 Q 
A How long, Ms. Grisham, in advance had you been in that telework status? 
Oh, my goodness. I mean, honestly, probably 3 to 4 months at least. 
Q Okay. 
A The East Wing really shut down and worked from home for months. 
Q When was the last time before --I guess when was the last time you were in 
11 the White House? Had you been there since election night? We talked about election 
12 night. 
13 A Oh, yeah, absolutely. I had been in there, for sure. But it was --you 
14 know, you go in, get a few things done. I had definitely been --I don't have --I don't 
15 know how many times. 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 Q Okay. 
A You could look on the badge-in, badge-out logs. 
Q Yeah. So let's talk about the morning. 
Were you watching the Ellipse event on television? 
A Yeah. I was --again, I had a bad feeling. I had been hearing about all the 
21 people that were coming. You know, you could see on social media and the news the 
22 anger that was brewing. 
23 The President had not conceded and was stoking these "it was stolen from us" 
24 types of things and I just had a really bad feeling. 
25 And so I was, of course, watching TV out of curiosity, but, also, it was my job to  53 
1 always keep Mrs. Trump informed of what was going on. 
2 And that day she had a photo shoot. She had just gotten a new carpet that she 
3 wanted put into the residence, and they were doing a big photo shoot for a potential 
4 book one day about all the changes she made. So I knew she wasn't probably in front of 
5 a TV. 
6 Q Got it. Okay. So you're watching this speech and the rally, the other 
7 speeches. 
8 A couple things I want to ask you about that he said. He talked, for instance, 
9 about the Vice President and said, the Vice President can be a hero or a coward. 
10 Were you aware at that point of any conflict between the President and the Vice 
11 President with respect to the joint session or the election? 
12 
13 A 
Q No. 
Okay. So the first you heard of the Vice President's role it was during the 
14 speech itself? 
15 A Well, I mean, there had been, like, leaks in the news that I had been 
16 following. I had never asked Mrs. Trump about it, to be honest with you. And, again, 
17 at that point, I was so disenfranchised with everyone and everything that had been going 
18 on that I truly was kind of staying out of it. I was doing my job for her and staying out of 
19 the rest of it. 
Q I understand. 20 
21 He says several times during his speech that he is going to go to the Capitol. "I'll 
22 be right there with you." 
23 He says, "We are going to peacefully and patriotically go to the Capitol and make 
24 our voices heard." 
25 What was your reaction when you heard him declare his intent to actually go to  54 
1 the Capitol with the crowd? 
2 A My first reaction was, wow, I can't believe Secret Service approved that. So 
3 I was very surprised by that. And then, when he did not do it, I was disgusted because I 
4 know very well that, especially with that crowd, he did that intentionally to really get 
5 them jazzed up. 
6 And, again, just because of my knowledge of how things worked, especially with 
7 advance, someone told him they're marching to the Capitol. He knew these people 
8 planned to march to the Capitol. 
9 I guarantee he said, whether he meant it or not, oh, I want to walk --do it with 
10 them. And then I'm sure Secret Service said no. 
11 He's actually quite terrified of being in danger. So I think he knew Secret Service 
12 would say no. But I knew the minute he said that that he was doing that on purpose to 
13 rile up the crowd, again, after I at first was like, whoa, Secret Service is letting him? 
14 There is no way. And I was just disgusted by the tactic. 
15 Q Yeah. Okay. 
16 
17 A 
Q Yeah. 
So he finishes his speech. Anything else you remember about the speech 
18 that gave you a similar reaction of disgust or any reaction? 
19 A No. You know, honestly, not about his speech, but just about the 
20 temperature of the people. I don't know if that makes sense. The fervor, the anger. 
21 You know, we always had banners and "lock her up" chants, et cetera, et cetera. 
22 But after watching for 5, 6 years and being intimately involved in all of those rallies, to see 
23 just the people and some of the banners and whatnot, it was just --it just felt --it felt 
24 dangerous, and I just had a bad feeling. 
25 Ms. Cheney came off of mute.  1 
2 
3 55 
Go ahead, Ms. Cheney. 
Ms. Cheney. Thank you,. 
Ms. Grisham, you said disgusted by the tactic. Could you just explain that a little 
4 bit more? 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 Ms. Grisham. Of him saying we're going to march? 
Ms. Cheney. Yeah. 
Ms. Grisham. Okay. 
Ms. Cheney. That was, I think, what you were responding to. 
Ms. Grisham. Yeah. Just because I know him so well. And even if Secret 
10 Service had given him permission, that man was not going to march down the street with 
11 people. I just know him. He's afraid of people. He doesn't want to do those things. 
12 And so he was just riling up a crowd that you could tell was already angry. 
13 And knowing those supporters, and, I mean, if I were in that group and the 
14 President of the United States said, hey, we're headed to the Capitol, that would give 
15 me --I don't even know --such energy to go do it. Like, oh, our President's with us. 
16 And so I was just disgusted by that tactic, because I knew he wasn't going to 
17 march down there. And he knew he wasn't going to march down there. And, yet, he 
18 said it. And he clearly was told these people are going to march down there. There is 
19 no way --he knew. He knew. That's just --he knew. 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 House. Ms. Cheney. Thank you. 
Ms. Grisham. Uh-huh. 
BY 
Q When he leaves the stage, he doesn't march. He goes back to the White 
25 Did you just continue, Ms. Grisham, to monitor the news coverage as to what's  56 
1 going on with the people that do go to the Capitol? Tell me about --walk me forward 
2 with respect to what you saw and what you did after the speech. 
3 A Yeah. I just --I mean, I just kept watching coverage. Again, I just wanted 
4 to --it was my job to keep Mrs. Trump informed of what was going on. 
5 Again, usually she watched TV more than I did, but, in this instance, I knew what 
6 she was doing. So I watched what was happening. And things started to get violent. 
7 And then at that point, I sent her --I sent you the text. 
8 
9 
10 
11 Q Yeah. 
A But I sent her the text. 
Q Let's talk about that. That's exhibit 5, and we'll pull it up on the screen. 
This is another text that you sent to us. And it looks like the time stamp here is 
12 January 6th at 1:25 p.m. 
13 
14 
15 First of all, do you think that that's accurate? That's --
A Yeah. 
Q The President stopped speaking at around 1, a little bit after 1, and television 
16 coverage has violence. It's not yet inside the Capitol, but violence on the Capitol 
17 Grounds has started by this point, 1:25. 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 A Uh-huh. 
Q So do you think the time stamp here, Ms. Grisham, is accurate? 
A Yes. I mean, unless --
Q Okay. 
A Unless iPhones messed it up in somehow. But yes. 
Q Okay. And your question to Mrs. Trump is, "Do you want to tweet that 
24 peaceful protests are the right of every American, but there is no place for lawlessness 
25 and violence?"  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 A 
Q Correct. 
The response is just very simply, "No." 
Tell me --
A 
Q Correct. 
Tell me about this exchange. 
6 A So I sent that --I sent that to her because, again, she had always been the 
7 more pragmatic one. She did not like violence. When the Charlottesville things 
8 happened, she was one of the --or she was the first to tweet that out, even though it 
9 made the President angry. 
10 So I was hoping that she would, again, be a voice of reason and tweet that out. 
11 made sure in the tweet that it wasn't political, it wasn't laying blame, it wasn't saying 57 
12 anything bad about anyone. It was truly just like, hey, there is no place for lawlessness 
13 and violence. 
14 And in our interactions generally when I would send her any kind of a specific 
15 tweet or a suggestion, she would say, no, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, because of this, 
16 that, or the other. Like, no, they won't believe me, or, no, it won't matter anyway. 
17 I would venture to say that in all the years I worked for her that's one of, I mean, 
18 probably less than five texts where she just said no. She didn't explain herself. She 
19 just said no. 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A How quickly did she --if you remember, there is no --
It was --yeah. It was fast. It was immediate. It was very fast. 
Okay. So very soon after she received --
Very soon after, yes. 
Because she just says no with no explanation. 
Correct.  Did you try to reach her? Did you try to speak to her? 
No. 
So you didn't have any conversations --58 
1 
2 
3 
4 Q 
A 
Q 
A You know, by that point, again, she had been starting to change and evolve 
5 over that 2 or 3 weeks. And, again, she had started to say, like, something's not right 
6 here and let's listen to the West Wing. And she had started to, in my opinion, drink 
7 somebody's Kool-Aid that perhaps this election was stolen. 
8 And because I knew she was up there with the carpet and I was watching violence 
9 take place at our Capitol, and she just literally said no to me with no explanation, I just --I 
10 mean, I kind of was like just fuck you. 
11 I mean, I'm sorry for the transcript person. But I was so, so disappointed in her. 
12 I was more disappointed in her than I had ever, ever been, because she had a chance to 
13 take a real leadership role. And I know for a fact she was amazing at influencing her 
14 husband sometimes with these kinds of things, you know. 
15 And even the fact that the video that he did. Like, I can't believe she wasn't on 
16 the phone telling him do the video immediately. 
17 He really did listen to her all the time. And so, while I don't know this for a fact, I 
18 know from experience with her something had gotten to her. And she --I feel like she 
19 knew about this protest. I feel like she knew something was going to happen. 
20 Otherwise, she would have given me an explanation. 
21 And so then, as you can see in the next text, I had already sent the email resigning. 
22 Q Yeah. Let me just ask you about that. 
23 When you --it sounds like your relationship with Mrs. Trump was really affected 
24 by this change. Somebody had gotten to her, her views about the election, to the point 
25 where you stepped away? You decided to resign that day?  1 
2 Tell me more about that your decision to resign. 
A Yeah. I mean, look, our --I mean, our relationship had been kind of 
3 eroding because of things with Mark Meadows and things I had been seeing and telling 
4 her about and the people he had been hiring. And normally she would have taken 
5 action, and she hadn't. 
6 So it had started to erode --I'm just going to be honest --I would say 6 months 
7 prior. But nothing like that. You know, that day, for her to just say no, I just couldn't 
8 take any more. 
9 And I had already tried to resign a few times in the previous months. She had 
10 always talked me out of it. 59 
11 And so, that day, I sent an email, and I cc'd Marcia Clark [sic], who was, you know, 
12 who is our senior advisor, and that way I felt like I couldn't be talked out of it if I put 
13 someone else on the email, and I resigned, yeah. 
14 
15 
16 
17 Q Yeah. What was the breaking point? Was it this tweet or --
A It was that --it was that text. 
Q Okay. 
A It was the fact that she would not take time out of photographing a carpet 
18 while our Capitol was being assaulted to tell people to be peaceful. 
19 
20 Q Yeah. 
A I wasn't asking her to go against anyone or to say Biden was a good guy, 
21 nothing. It was just please be peaceful. And she wouldn't take the time out of it, and 
22 that was it. 
23 Q And that was the moment at which you decided that you needed to quit 
24 right away? 
25 A Yeah. Yeah.  1 
2 email? 
3 
4 
5 Q 
A 
Q 
A 60 
All right. And how did you do that? Did you do it by letter or by text or by 
I sent an email on my White House account and -­
To her? To Mrs. Trump? 
To her, yes. And I said with --I actually --if you want that, I know I have it 
6 somewhere, and I'd be happy to send it to you. 
7 
8 
9 
10 Q 
A 
Q 
A Yeah. Please do. 
And it definitely says --let me write that down. 
Yeah. And I can follow up with you, Ms. Grisham, afterwards about this. 
Okay. Yeah. I said, like, after the things that have happened in the past 
11 6 months and the treatment that I've had personally and the things I've seen, I can no 
12 longer be here. You know, I have been honored to work for you, but I'm done effective 
13 immediately. 
14 Q And her response is this text message at 3:59. She says, "I'm saddened to 
15 receive your email. I am very grateful for your unwavering support and friendship over 
16 the last 4" --it cuts off. 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Yeah. 
But that's the only official response from her that you get? 
Correct. 
Did you ever speak to her about this or have a subsequent conversation? 
Later in the day I said, the news of my resignation is going to leak out to the 
22 press. I have --I will have nothing but good things to say about the work we did. 
23 
24 And she never responded, and I never --we've never spoken again. 
Q Okay. So you've never spoken to her on the phone or in person since your 
25 resignation?  A 
Q Never, no. 
Got it. Okay. 61 
1 
2 
3 Let's go back to the afternoon of the 6th. I know you weren't there, and I know 
4 that you were --we've talked about your role in this text exchange. 
5 And I see Ms. Cheney. 
6 Before I go there, do you have other questions about the 
7 Ms. Cheney. I just wanted to --thanks,--- I wanted to ask one thing. 
8 Ms. Grisham, you said that Mrs. Trump's response to you made you feel like she 
9 knew about the protests, that she knew that something --I think you said she knew that 
10 this was going to happen. 
11 
12 
13 Ms. Grisham. Yeah. 
Ms. Cheney. Tell us a little bit more about that, about --
Ms. Grisham. So it's hard for me, right, because this is clearly my opinion and 
14 speculation. But, again, having worked with her for so long and growing so close to her, 
15 she literally wanted to know every detail about every movement, ever, that she was going 
16 to make or, if she was with her husband, that she and her husband were going to make. 
17 She never went into anything without knowing what was going on. And that 
18 included any kind of a statement we put out. If I would suggest something, she'd ask 
19 me, like, what's happening? What are the details? What's going on? Why would we 
20 put this out? Or, you know, there was always a back and forth. I cannot think of a 
21 time that it was ever like, no, like that. 
22 And so, based on the few things she had said to me previously of something's not 
23 right here, something's going on --meaning with the election --and let's work with the 
24 West Wing, and let's do what the West Wing says --which had never been done --and 
25 then for me to give her that tweet --which was really quite benign, and, as I said, it didn't  62 
1 talk about the election, it didn't talk about who won or who lost, it truly just was calling 
2 for peace --and for her to just write back "no" immediately like that was something that 
3 she had never, ever, ever done. 
4 And she never, to my recollection, avoided wading into things when it would be to 
5 help people or call for peace. 
6 So I hate that I don't have any proof here, but knowing her as well as I did, I just 
7 felt like she knew that this --she knew that something was going on, and she knew it 
8 wouldn't be good for her to tweet about it. 
9 Ms. Cheney. Okay. Thank you. 
10 
11 
12 Ms. Grisham. Yeah. You're welcome. 
BY 
Q I want to ask you, Ms. Grisham, about what you heard from others, 
13 colleagues at the White House, about what they observed over the course of the 
14 afternoon. You told me some of this in our informal interview. But did you hear, for 
15 instance, what the President himself was doing when he returned from the Ellipse after 
16 the speech as the riot took place? 
17 
18 
19 A 
Q 
A Yeah. I heard --and, again, I apologize, I don't have specific -­
Yeah. That's okay. 
I just don't have specific names. But I heard from several people in the 
20 West Wing, more on the military aide or Secret Service side, and then a couple just 
21 people, but that he was sitting in the dining room, and he was just watching it all unfold, 
22 and that a couple of his comments --some of his comments were that these people 
23 looked very trashy, but also look at what fighters they were. 
24 And that certainly rang true to me, because he always talked about what a fighter 
25 I was. He was always talking about how tough I was and what a fighter I was. And he  63 
1 did that with a lot of people. That was very important to him, if you were tough and you 
2 were a fighter. 
3 And so he was kind of reveling in the fact that these people were fighting for him. 
4 But he also didn't like how they looked. 
5 Q So he thought they were both trashy, but fighters, but somehow fighting for 
6 him, or at least this is what you heard from others? 
7 A Yes. That's what I heard. I was certainly not --I was, like I said, I wasn't 
8 even in the White House. I was certainly not in the Oval, wasn't in that dining room. 
9 don't know if he expected them to be wearing full suits of like Roman armor and that 
10 would have made them not trashy. But he did feel they looked trashy, but he loved how 
11 they were fighting for him. 
12 Q Yeah. Who told you that, Ms. Grisham? What were --who were your 
13 sources? 
14 A I can't remember who all was saying it. Like I said, I was at home. I was 
15 talking to people. I was trying to look through my texts, and I can't find any texts that 
16 actually say that. So I'm still kind of thinking it through, and I want to talk to another 
17 individual that I don't want to say the name of right now, who I think was always also 
18 hearing those things. So I'll work with you on that. 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 Q Okay. So some people who were present in the White House --
A Yeah. 
Q --not teleworking like you --
A No. 
Q --actually shared with you their impressions of what occurred? 
A From the West Wing, correct. 
Q Okay. Yes. I would very much like to get more information about that  64 
1 from you and follow up on that. And if you have text messages to that effect. 
2 A I don't. I did look for that. I looked everywhere, and I couldn't find them. 
3 Q All right. What else did you hear, beyond the President watching television 
4 in the dining room, about other people's activities? Did you hear anything, for instance, 
5 about tweets or about proposed statements that the President might make? 
6 A No. I didn't hear about anything that he was supposed to say, may say. 
7 heard that people were walking in and trying --such as lvanka --and trying to get him to 
8 say things. 
9 You know, if there were proposed tweets, then Dan Scavino would have those, 
10 because all of the tweets that the President ever wanted to tweet had to be printed out. 
11 He never just, like, looked at them on a computer. 
12 
13 
14 
15 Q 
A 
Q 
A He might get a hard copy and then -­
Always. 
Yeah. 
And literally mark it up. I mean, I watched poor Dan walk back and forth 
16 seven times sometimes for one tweet. 
17 But I never heard about any --1 heard people were asking him, such as lvanka, to 
18 say something, do something. And of course just the news reports I got about people 
19 calling. But I never heard exactly who was coming in and imploring him to do what. 
20 Q When you say that lvanka was asking him to do something, that implies that 
21 he was somehow resistant to doing something. Was that the sense you've gotten from 
22 these other people? 
23 A The sense I got was that, yes, he was resistant and not hearing or wanting to 
24 do anything. Also the fact that people were not able to get through to him on the 
25 phone is very telling, because that man is --loves to talk on the phone. And so the fact  65 
1 that there were large chunks of time with no phone calls apparently, in my opinion --my 
2 opinion --he just didn't want to hear from those people. 
3 Q Yeah. He eventually --he tweets a couple of things. He tweets that 
4 Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what was right, directly critical of the Vice 
5 President in the middle of the violence. 
6 Do you remember that? 
7 
8 
9 A 
Q 
A Yep. 
Tell me what you --
1 just remember thought --I remember thinking that was disgusting and that 
10 Mike Pence had always been a very loyal and good Vice President and that he was putting 
11 the Vice President at danger --in danger --especially when all of those people were 
12 walking down to the Capitol. 
13 I just remember being disgusted. But it was just such a day of disgust that it's 
14 hard to, like, pick it all out. 
15 Q I see. 
16 He then issues a couple of other tweets that essentially tell people to stay 
17 peaceful, or remain peaceful, does not ask them to leave the Capitol. 
18 Do you remember either seeing those yourself or hearing from others discussion 
19 of how he arrived at that language? 
20 
21 A 
Q No. 
Okay. He then issues an actual video statement that he tapes in the Rose 
22 Garden, and that is issued at about 4:17. And this is the one where he says, we love 
23 you, and this is what happens when an election landslide is taken away, but does finally 
24 tell people or ask people to go home. 
25 Do you remember seeing the video and having a reaction to that?  66 
1 A I remember seeing the video. I remember thinking someone finally clearly 
2 got through to him. And I remember being disappointed that it was so late. 
3 And then I remember hearing --I think in the news, nowhere else --that there 
4 were several versions because he didn't want to be very strong at first. But, again, I 
5 don't know anything about that. 
6 Q Okay. Anything else, Ms. Grisham, that you heard from others about 
7 activities at the White House by the President or others during this period of violence that 
8 afternoon? Anything that sticks out that you recall? 
9 A No. 
10 Q Okay. 
11 A No. 
12 Q Did you ever hear anything about the Insurrection Act, martial law, anything 
13 like that regarding January 6th? Did you hear --1 think you told me before that you 
14 spoke to a guy from Arizona about this. 
15 A Yes. And, actually, in thinking --it's funny. It's not funny. But in 
16 thinking that through, that situation that I told you about was actually the situation when 
17 he went across to the church with the Bible. 
18 
19 
20 Q Oh, a different --okay. 
A Totally different. So I had conflated the two. I apologize. 
Q So did you hear anything about the Insurrection Act or military with respect 
21 to January 6th? 
22 
23 
24 
25 the --A No. 
Q What you heard about was connected to the --
A That was when he walked over with the Bible in front of the church with  1 
2 
3 
4 Q Understood. 
A --I think, the BLM, yeah. 
Q Yeah. Okay. All right. 
Did you hear anything about him attempting to contact Members of Congress 
5 during the riot because of the joint session had been interrupted? Anything like that? 
6 
7 
8 A No. 
Q Okay. 
A I heard just the opposite, that people were trying to talk to him, and he 
9 wasn't answering or available. 
Q Okay. 
Ms. Cheney, you're back off of mute. Go ahead. 
Ms. Cheney. Thanks. 
Did you talk at all to Dan Scavino on the 6th, Ms. Grisham? 67 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 Ms. Grisham. No. He --Dan Scavino wasn't speaking to me by then, because I 
15 was a leaker. Wait. Officially, I was not a leaker. And put that on the transcript. 
16 
17 Ms. Cheney. Okay. How about to Johnny McEntee? 
Ms. Grisham. No. Same thing. By that point, I was absolutely persona non 
18 grata due to Mark Meadows. 
19 Ms. Cheney. So did you talk to anybody, either text message or phone call, while 
20 the violence was happening? 
21 
22 
23 Ms. Grisham. No. 
Ms. Cheney. Anybody who had left the White House? 
Ms. Grisham. No. Not that I can think of. I mean, I'm picturing --I was in my 
24 bedroom on that bed watching everything, and I was just so focused on her. 
25 And then, of course, after I resigned, I spoke with Rickie Niceta, the social  68 
1 secretary, but that was more of a, oh, my gosh, this is what I just did. 
2 There is nobody --at that point, I knew that things were so far gone, nobody I 
3 would be able to talk to would be able to do anything. And I knew that Scavino and 
4 McEntee especially would have been right behind the President egging him on. 
5 Ms. Cheney. Did anybody else contact you about the possibility that they might 
6 resign? 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 Ms. Grisham. No. No. 
Ms. Cheney. Okay. Thank you. 
Ms. Grisham. Yep. 
Thanks, Ms. Cheney. 
BY 
Q Other people did resign, Ms. Grisham. Matt Pottinger resigned and Sarah 
13 Matthews resigned and there are a couple of Cabinet Secretaries that resigned. It 
14 sounds like you didn't speak to any of them about their respective --
15 A No. I was the first to resign. And when I heard that the other ones did, I 
16 was of course --I was happy, because that's a lonely feeling when you do something like 
17 that, and I was disappointed more people didn't. 
18 Q Yeah. After your resignation, let's talk about conversations you may have 
19 had after the 6th. 
20 Did you get more information from people sort of in the days, weeks, months 
21 after January 6th about what happened that informed your view? 
22 A No. Again, I was so --like I just --I can't express to you guys enough how 
23 disenfranchised and disconnected I was by that time, that I --and then of course, when I 
24 resigned, I committed the ultimate cardinal sin and nobody has spoken to me since then, 
25 literally.  69 
1 Q Were there people, though, that sort of gave --that thanked you or that said 
2 that they approved of or understood what you did, voices that were supportive in the 
3 time since your resignation? 
4 A I mean, not --I mean, of course, a few friends of mine who I'm just friends 
5 with. But there is nobody who reached out to me and said, like, great job, that I can 
6 remember. 
7 Q Yeah. 
8 A Great job. You're brave. You should have done that. Nothing that I can 
9 think of, huh-uh. 
10 Q Okay. 
11 A I literally can tell you I probably talked to five people on one --less than five 
12 people from the White House since I resigned. 
13 Q That's it. Do you remember, like, who those folks are, the five or so that 
14 you've talked to since your resignation? 
15 A Yeah. I talked to Rickie Niceta, who is the former social secretary. Emma 
16 Doyle, who was Mick Mulvaney's deputy --principal deputy chief of staff. I do talk to 
17 Mick on occasion. And then a couple of my old assistants. 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 Q Who are they? 
A Baxter Murrell and Annie LeHardy. 
Q Got it. Okay. Baxter Murrell and Annie LeHardy. 
A Uh-huh. 
Q Yeah. Let me just ask you about a couple of other names. 
Will Russell, for example, was one of the President's kind of body men. Did you 
24 ever talk with Will after --
25 A Nope. Nope.  Q Okay. 
Never. Never. 
How about -­
He --
I'm sorry. Go ahead. 70 
1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Oh, I apologize. Again, I had, for election night and the RNC evening at the 
7 White House, I did not make many friends, because as chief of staff I kind of had control 
8 of the South Lawn, and obviously the residence part of the White House, the State Floor, 
9 et cetera. 
10 And so, for election night and the RNC event, I was very against using government 
11 resources and the museum --that is, the White House --for political events. And so by 
12 that point, Will Russell and Max Miller, who was the chief of staff for operations at the 
13 campaign, Nick Luna, all of those people were very unhappy with me because I wouldn't 
14 let a lot of things take place there that I perceived to be inappropriate. 
15 Q I see. So is it --I'm understanding from that testimony, Ms. Grisham, that 
16 the First Lady in the East Wing actually controls access to the South Lawn, that's part of 
17 the way the White House operates, the South Lawn sort of lives with the East Wing and is 
18 controlled by the East Wing? 
19 A Yeah. Yes. Like the Easter Egg Roll, the Congressional Picnic, all of the 
20 events that happen on the South Lawn are under our purview. 
21 Now, while the West Wing might do some of the events, they have to work with 
22 the East Wing on all of that happening. 
23 
24 
25 Q But that doesn't include the Ellipse. 
A Correct. 
Q That's outside the gates.  71 
A Yeah. 
Q That's the Park Service. 1 
2 
3 A Which they, I think, did very intentionally, actually, because they would have 
4 had to deal with us. 
5 Q Yeah. So the Ellipse event on January 6th, that is not a South Lawn event 
6 controlled by the East Wing. 
A That's National Park Service, yeah. 
Q Okay. All right. How about the --7 
8 
9 A Who, by the way, I would talk to. The National Park Service often felt 
10 bullied by the White House and by the campaign. 
Q Okay. 
A So --11 
12 
13 Q Do you remember the names of the White House Military Office folks or the 
14 valets that either were there on the 6th or who were generally there around that time? 
15 A One person I remember obviously is because he was with 
16 us most of the time. There is another one. I can find out his name. I picture him 
17 right now. And those were the two that were generally with the President. 
18 Q Do you remember a man named who was a valet who 
19 would be sitting in the pantry, bringing the President Diet Cokes or whatever? Does that 
20 name sound familiar? 
21 A That doesn't sound familiar, but that is exactly what would happen. 
22 Somebody would be in that pantry, and the minute the President hit his button, the 
23 person --the valet would come in and give whoever was in the dining room what they 
24 wanted. 
25 And the pantry is very, very close. There is just one door. Half the time it's not  72 
1 even closed. So whoever the valet was at that time would have heard and seen 
2 whatever was going on in there. 
3 Q Yeah. So it sounds like, Ms. Grisham, pretty standard that, in that pantry, 
4 someone was there all the time. 
A Always there, yes, yeah. 5 
6 Q Okay. And there would be presumably have been someone on duty there 
7 on January 6th? 
8 
9 
10 A Absolutely, yes. 
Q And that is right next to the dining room, so --
A That is literally --yeah. It's --you walk --you can see through the door, and 
11 the door is rarely --it's rarely closed. 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 Q Got it. Okay. 
A And the President is not exactly quiet, so --
Q No? 
A Even if it was closed. 
Q Understood. 
And how about the photographers? Do you remember Shealah Craighead? 
A Yeah. 
Q Was she a photographer --
A Yeah. She was everywhere. She was everywhere for everything. 
I will say there were many times that I witnessed myself, the President would just 
22 tell her to go away. He didn't want her around. But she definitely was there for 
23 everything. 
24 And then we had a couple of videographers. Alex Alexander was the most 
25 talented and sought after. He was very good. So he was one of the videographers.  73 
1 Now, they weren't around all the time, but if they were summoned to do a 
2 video --
3 
4 
5 Q 
A 
Q Got it. I believe his name is actually Alex Anderson? 
Oh, Anderson, yes. I apologize. 
No, that's fine. And he would be summoned if there was the need for a 
6 recording of a video like --
7 A Correct. He wasn't like Shea. He wasn't, like, around all the time like 
8 Shea was around all the time. 
9 Q You mentioned Tim Harleth. He was the usher. Is he the person that 
10 controlled access up and down to the residence? 
11 
12 
13 A 
Q 
A Yes. Yeah. Yeah. 
Is he the only one, or were there a staff of them? 
There is a staff of them. But Tim was very --I hate to use the word 
14 controlling, because it just sounds rude --but Tim was very --he took a lot of pride in his 
15 job. And so he oftentimes made sure he was the one who approved people coming in. 
16 He would WAVE people in a lot chimes without my knowledge. And the only reason I 
17 cared was because Mrs. Trump always wanted to be warned before people were coming 
18 into her house. 
19 And then he would of course ride elevators up and down anytime the guests 
20 would come. So he most certainly knew who was in the residence and when. 
21 Q And didn't he come from the Trump hotels? 
22 A Yeah. I actually interviewed him, yeah. He worked at the OPO, at the 
23 Trump hotel in D.C. 
24 
25 Q 
A Okay. 
And they wanted --the Trumps understandably wanted somebody they felt  74 
1 comfortable with, because that's a very personal --the usher sees a lot of personal things. 
2 So he came in almost immediately when we took office. 
3 Q Understood. 
4 Is there anyone else, Ms. Grisham, who would kind of be in that Oval inner circle 
5 that would be in a position to have seen or heard things --
6 
7 A 
Q In the residence? 
Yeah. Either in the residence or down in the Oval? I'm just looking for 
8 any names or positions of people that you recall. 
9 A So in the Oval, you would have had --in outer Oval, you would have had 
10 Molly Michael, Dan Scavino, and Nick Luna. Towards the end, I understand they had 
11 hired another junior person. I don't know his name. 
12 
13 
14 
15 Q 
A 
Q 
A Yeah. Austin Ferrer maybe? 
Yep, that's him. 
Yeah. 
In the dining room, as I said, there was always a White House Military --a 
16 valet --in that room. 
17 And then of course there was always Secret Service. They were never in the 
18 Oval, though. They were outside. 
19 In terms of the residence, it would have been --there is butler staff, of course, 
20 who would come in and serve anybody who was --like let's say people were in that 
21 Yellow Oval. The butler staff would come in and see if anybody wanted something to 
22 drink, et cetera. There were three or four of them. 
23 And then there would have been Timothy, who would know who was going up 
24 and down and when. And Timothy had a staff of three. 
25 Q Okay.  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 A Yeah. 
Q Timothy Harleth. Okay. 
A Timothy Harleth, yeah. 
Q Okay. 
All right. Ms. Grisham, I don't have anything else prepared, but 
6 I'm just wondering if there is anything else that you recall that you think might be 
7 relevant, might be of interest to the select committee, anything else at all while I have 
8 you that you can --75 
9 Ms. Grisham. No. I mean, I'm actually --I'm bummed out that at the end I was 
10 so separate, because I feel like I could have been probably a lot more helpful. I just 
11 think that Mrs. Trump's behavior was really, really telling. And, yeah, anything else you 
12 guys ever need, obviously I'm around. 
13 Well, I'm going to follow up with you on the document issue. 
14 
15 
16 Ms. Grisham. Yeah. 
So I'll call you or send you an email about that. 
Ms. Grisham. Okay. Perfect. 
17 But let me stop here and see if, Ms. Cheney, if you have any other 
18 questions. 
19 Ms. Cheney. Thank you so much. And I apologize if you touched on this,1111 
20 But, Ms. Grisham, has anybody reached out to you since your testimony's become 
21 public or your cooperation with the committee? 
22 
23 
24 Ms. Grisham. What do you --like who? 
Ms. Cheney. Anybody in the --anybody attempting to influence your testimony? 
Ms. Grisham. No. I have had private eyes suddenly following myself and my 
25 family and people trying to dig up dirt on me to discredit me and make me an uncredible,  1 I think, witness for you guys. But nobody has reached out. 
2 
3 
4 Ms. Cheney. Okay. Thank you very much. Thanks for your cooperation. 
Ms. Grisham. Thank you. Thank you for everything you're doing. 
Yeah. Ms. Grisham, I'll just echo Ms. Cheney's thanks. We 76 
5 appreciate this. You have been available to us voluntarily. And, on behalf of the select 
6 committee, we really appreciate it. 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 Ms. Grisham. Well, whatever you guys need. 
Okay. All right. That's all we have, then. Thanks very much. 
Ms. Grisham. All right. 
We'll go off the record.
