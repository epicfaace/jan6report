Subject: GA Data request by Senator Graham 
Hi, Richard! I've been helping out in GA since Nov 4 at behest of White House. So I'm steeped 
in the GA cases. 
Last night, Sen Graham told the GA GOP Chairman David Shafer that he wants names of 100 
voters in 3 categories that the Trump campaign believes / has identified as illegal votes included 
in the vote totals from Nov 3. 
One of the key GA lawyers helping the President is Alex Kaufman, copied here. Alex and 2 of 
the data experts arrived in DC last night. They can come to your office today/ or do zoom call 
and can get Sen Graham whatever he needs. If you just work with us on what Lindsey wants/ 
needs, we can get that to you for him. I'm also available to do a call with you, the Senator, 
whoever. 
Bottom line: there are more illegal votes included in the certified GA election results than 
the margin between Biden and Trump. While the SOS has certified the results, the actual 
number of votes is far from certain. And the SOS has refused to try to get to the truth. Ever. 
Let us know what you need. Thanks!! Cleta
