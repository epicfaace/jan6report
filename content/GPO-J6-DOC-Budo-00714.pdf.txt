1/6 Speaker Schedule 
Hey guys, I spent the better part of the day on the phone with these organizers, and was able to get a little 
guidance from the White House. 
1 The green marks are those who are already confirmed speaking on the 5th. 
2. The red marks are suggested to move to the 5th and/or SCOTUS. 
3. The yellow marks either don't pass vetting or there may be an issue to explore. 
4. POTUS expectations are to have something intimate at the ellipse, and call on everyone to march to the capitol. This 
actually works out, because Ali's group is already setting up at the Capitol, and SCOTUS is on the way. 
5. I think we should secure a SCOTUS stage and have the higher profile, more serious policy speakers, who are not 
speaking on the 5th, speak there right after POTUS on the way to the Capitol. 
I'm happy to put together a suggested lineup with additional elected officials and confirm with the 5th folks. Cindy and I 
are in a good place, so I think we can get it cleared up by tomorrow. 
Thoughts?
