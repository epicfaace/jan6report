1 Let's go on the record. 
2 This is the deposition of Garrett Ziegler conducted by the House Select Committee 
3 to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol pursuant to House 
4 Resolution 503. 
5 This will be a staff-led deposition, though members may choose to ask questions 
6 as they so desire. 
7 
8 My name is I am a senior investigative counsel with the select 
committee. Present in the room with me is professional staff member. 
9 Members may join the deposition either in person or by Webex, and I'll do my best to 
10 note their presence as they join. 
11 We'll be holding this deposition under House rules that we've previously provided 
12 to Mr. Ziegler and his counsel. 
13 Under those rules, Mr. Ziegler, you're permitted to have your attorney present. 
14 I'll note for the record that your attorney is present and I'll have him identify himself in a 
15 moment. 
16 Counsel for other persons or other government agencies may not attend. In 
17 other words, the only lawyers who are present today are those from the select 
18 committee and your counsel. 
19 At this time, I'd ask Mr. Ziegler's counsel to please state his name for the record. 
20 Mr. Kiyonaga. My name is John Kiyonaga, K-i-y-o-n-a-g-a. I'm counsel for 
21 Garrett Ziegler, Z-i-e-g-1-e-r, the deponent in this matter. 
22 - Thank you, John. 
23 Before we get started, I'd like to cover a few grounds rules for today's deposition. 
24 As you heard me mention before --well, maybe you didn't hear me mention 
25 because I didn't say it --we have an official reporter who's transcribing the deposition.  4 
1 The deposition's also being video recorded, but the reporter's transcription is the official 
2 record of the proceeding. So it's important that you wait to answer each question until 
3 it's completed before you give your answer, and I'll do my best to wait until you complete 
4 your answer before I ask the next question. 
5 The reporter cannot note nonverbal responses, such as shaking or nodding of the 
6 head, so it's important that you respond to each question with an audible verbal 
7 response. 
8 If you need to take any breaks or would like to discuss anything with your attorney 
9 privately, we're happy to accommodate you and take breaks as best we can. 
10 You may only refuse to answer a question to preserve a privilege recognized by 
11 the select committee. If you refuse to answer a question based on privilege, staff may 
12 either proceed with the deposition or seek a ruling from the chair on the objection at that 
13 time. If the chairman overrules such an objection, either after the objection is made or 
14 at the end of the deposition, you will be required to answer the question. 
15 I want to remind you that it's unlawful to deliberately provide false information to 
16 Congress. And because you will be taking an oath to tell the truth in this deposition, a 
17 knowingly false answer could subject you to prosecution for perjury. 
18 Do you have any questions on anything I said thus far? 
19 
20 
21 The Witness. No. 
Madam Reporter, I'd ask you to swear the witness, please. 
The Reporter. Yes, sir. 
22 Please raise your right hand. 
23 Do you solemnly swear and affirm, under the penalty of perjury, that the 
24 testimony you will give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? 
25 The Witness. I do.  1 
2 
3 start? 
4 5 
The Reporter. Thank you. 
- John, is there something you wanted to say on the record before we 
Mr. Kiyonaga. Yes. Mr. Ziegler has complied fully with the subpoena for 
5 documentation. That should not be taken as any concession on his part of the authority 
6 of the committee to seek such. He is going to be, beyond acknowledging his identity 
7 and the fact that he is the person subject to the subpoena and has provided documents 
8 and plenary compliance therewith, he is going to be refusing to answer any further 
9 questions based on his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, 
10 acknowledging the fact that incrimination does not connote any consciousness of guilt. 
11 Rather, it is any disclosure or statement that could tend to excite or encourage a 
12 surmise of guilt on the part of a third party, specifically any law enforcement entity, which 
13 definition I would take for purposes of this hearing to include the committee, and which 
14 concern is manifestly well-founded given the fact that his previous boss has been arrested 
15 in a very public manner. 
16 But also comprised within his invocation of privilege will be an executive privilege, 
17 deliberative privilege, Presidential communication privilege, privilege founded on 
18 freedom of association and First Amendment and privacy as the case may be. 
19 But I've instructed him in response to specific questions beyond the initial 
20 questions acknowledging who he is and why he's here simply to invoke his privilege. 
21 And I'm explaining ahead of time what that means to avoid a word salad every time a 
22 question is asked. 
23 If there develops a disagreement between myself or himself and the committee as 
24 to whether or not he is entitled to invoke privilege, he is going to require a ruling from an 
25 Article Ill judge, a United States district judge, compelling responses. He will not be  1 bound by a determination by the committee. 
2 So ask away. 
3 
4 - Okay. So I'm not going to respond to sort of all that. 
I do want to point out that we are not a --this committee is not a law 
5 enforcement agency. So I want to state that for the record and don't want my silence 
6 on that issue to connote any sort of type of agreement with your --with the assumption 
7 that you've made in connection with that statement. 6 
8 Mr. Kiyonaga. Yeah, I understand, and I note your disagreement. We'll have to 
9 disagree on that. But my position, his position, is that the committee is acting as one. 
10 So the fact that it's part of the legislative branch doesn't change the practical effect, in 
11 our view, of its operations. 
12 - Okay. And in terms of invoking privileges --well, I take it that Mr. 
13 Ziegler is going to, on your advice, is going to invoke the Fifth Amendment to any 
14 substantive question that I ask. 
15 Mr. Kiyonaga. Yes. 
16 - And I'd be fine --I think it would be helpful to articulate that clearly. 
17 If there are other objections that you also have that you'd like to reserve, I think that's 
18 also fine as well and not have to sort of state those every time. 
19 But I do want it to be clear, if there's a particular question to which Mr. Ziegler is 
20 asserting his Fifth Amendment rights, then that should be stated for the record. 
21 Mr. Kiyonaga. Well, what I'd like to do is assert his rights in the plural, 
22 understanding ahead of time that those comprise principally his Fifth Amendment right, 
23 but also on an individual basis the other rights that I've mentioned. I'm not sure I want 
24 to be bound by an analysis that I make on the fly in here today as to exactly which other 
25 privileges might apply.  7 
1 But I would state at the outset that the Fifth Amendment privilege should be 
2 taken, as far as we're concerned, to apply to any question you ask beyond the initial 
3 questions confirming who he is. 
4 So in other words, the other privileges that I mentioned a moment ago may or 
5 may not apply to particular questions that you ask, but the Fifth Amendment privilege will 
6 always apply. So that that will --that should cover basically any substantive question 
7 that you're going to be asking beyond the initial confirmation of who he is. 
8 
9 - Okay. Anything else we need to cover before we get started? 
Mr. Kiyonaga. I don't think so. 
10 EXAMINATION 
11 BY-
12 Q All right. Mr. Ziegler, if you can take a look at exhibit 1 in your binder. 
13 Exhibit 1 is the subpoena from this committee dated April 27th, 2022. 
14 Do you understand that you're appearing here today pursuant to that subpoena? 
15 
16 A 
Q Yes. 
The subpoena also calls for production of documents and information, 
17 including electronically stored information. 
18 Have you conducted a diligent search for records that are responsive to the 
19 subpoena? 
20 
21 A 
Q Yes. 
Have you produced to the committee all documents and communications in 
22 your possession, custody, or control that are responsive to the requests described in the 
23 subpoena?

2 
3 The Witness. Okay. BY-
Q Could you describe, generally, what efforts you took to comply with this 
4 subpoena, exhibit 1? 8 
5 A I conducted a search based on all of the electronic devices that I have access 
6 to and own and went through them diligently, including the electronic accounts, to mean 
7 email accounts, most of which I do not have access to anymore, particularly my former 
8 White House account where the lion's share of this correspondence would reside. 
9 And I understand that, based on my cursory knowledge of the Presidential 
10 Records Act, that account and all the materials therein are in the National Archives. 
11 Q When you say the account information, do you mean that you went online, 
12 for example, to Gmail or some other ISP, and tried to access your records that way as 
13 well? 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18

Mr. Kiyonaga. Could you indulge me one minute. 
[Discussion off the record.] 
Mr. Kiyonaga. Thank you. BY-
Q Did you look for hard copy documents, including any notebooks or notes of 
21 meetings? 
22 
23 A 
Q Yes. 
In your search for electronically stored information, did you also look for 
24 documents in addition to electronic communications? So, for example, Word 
25 documents or Excel spreadsheets or things of that nature?  1 
2 A 
Q All the above, yes. 
And in terms of emails that you searched, did you --I think you mentioned 
3 your work email and maybe difficulty --your prior work email --difficulty getting access 
4 to that. 
5 Did you look for documents, responsive documents connected to all of the email 
6 addresses that you had in the relevant time period?

Did you look for responsive messages under various messaging applications, 
17 for example, Signal or Telegram or WhatsApp? 
Yes. 9

20 did you use those platforms to communicate with other individuals?

A 
Q Yes. 
And did you search those platforms to see if you had responsive documents? 
Yes. 
Have you destroyed, deleted, or otherwise manipulated any documents 
25 responsive to the requests described in the subpoena?  1 
2 A 
Q No. 
Have you withheld from production any responsive documents based on a 
3 claim of privilege? 
4 
5 A No. 
Q So there's no document that you found that appeared responsive, but you 
6 felt that because of any other privileges that your counsel has referenced or otherwise 
7 that you feel you needed to or could produce the document? 
8 
9 A To my recollection, no. 
Q Okay. Could you briefly describe your educational background, starting 
10 after high school?
