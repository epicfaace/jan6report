In one day he ended every future 
opportunity that doesn't include 
speaking engagements at the 
local proud boys chapter 
And all of us that didn't have jobs 
lined up will be perpetually 
unemployed 
I'm so mad and upset 
We all look like domestic 
terrorists now 
Oh yes I've been crying for an 
hour 
She has no idea this made us all

I know 
Is she appalled or indifferent 
I was with them tonight for about 
2 hrs 
It was interesting and Jared said 
something very interesting that 
makes me think they know 
Grisham ... unreal 
What did she say 
She resigned 
I know did she put out a 
statement 
That's unreal 
She has done nothing 
It just feels so self serving 
Sorry
