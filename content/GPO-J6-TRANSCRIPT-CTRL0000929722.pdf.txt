23 GRAVES GARRETT LLC 2  Mr. Let's go ahead and go on the record. 1 
2 
3 Actually, we're not going to be recording. We had agreed previously that we 
4 won't be recording the interview. So we'll make those arrangements to stop that 
5 recording. 
6 This is a transcribed interview conducted by the House Select Committee to 
7 Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol pursuant to House 
8 Resolution 503. 
9 My name is , senior investigative counsel on the staff of the select 
10 committee. 
11 This will be a staff-led interview. Members of the select committee may choose 3 
12 to join and ask questions. I can see that right now we have Ms. Cheney, our vice chair, is 
13 present. I don't see any other members on the call, but if any of them --oh, there's Ms. 
14 Cheney. 
15 Good afternoon, Ms. Cheney. 
16 
17 
18 
19 Ms. Cheney. Hi. Good afternoon. 
Thank you very much, Speaker Vos, for joining us. 
Speaker Vos. Thanks. 
Mr. If other members of the committee join, I'll do my best to note that 
20 for the record so you can sort of keep track of folks as they're coming onto the call. 
21 In addition to members of the committee, we have members of the staff also 
22 participating who are present today. I can see is on the call. _, 
23 
24 
25 , and is in the conference room at the House office building. 
Before we get started, I want to go over a few ground rules. 
We're conducting the interview via Webex. We have agreed that the interview  4 
1 will not be recorded, but there will be an official record of the interview. And that's 
2 being made by the official reporters who are transcribing the interview right now and will 
3 for the duration of the interview. 
4 For the benefit of the reporters, we need to avoid talking over one another. So if 
5 you could please wait until each question is complete before you begin your response, 
6 and we'll wait until your response is complete before we start asking our next question so 
7 that we're not overlapping. It's really impossible for the reporters to take down a 
8 proper transcription if we're talking over one another. 
9 The reporters also can't record nonverbal responses, such as shaking or nodding 
10 of your head. So it's important when you're answering questions that you answer with 
11 an audible, verbal response. 
12 For the benefit of the reporter and the record, there may be times when I'll ask 
13 you to spell a name or a word or an acronym you're using, if you do so, and would ask 
14 that you do that for us. 
15 We ask you to provide complete answers based on your best recollection. If the 
16 question is not clear, please ask for clarification. If you don't know the answer, please 
17 simply say so. 
18 If you need breaks for any reason, for comfort, discuss anything with your 
19 attorney privately, just let us know, and we'll take whatever breaks you need. 
20 As we explain to all witnesses who appear before the select committee, please 
21 understand that it's unlawful to deliberately provide false information to Congress and 
22 that to do so could result in criminal penalties. 
23 Do you understand everything that we've covered so far? 
24 
25 Speaker Vos. I do. 
~ Any questions before we begin?  1 Speaker Vos. No. 
2 I understand that you have a statement that you'd like to read into 
3 the record before we get started. 
4 Or, Eddie, do you have something you want to add before Speaker Vos reads his 
5 statement? 
6 
7 Mr. Greim. Yes. Thank you, Mr .•. 
This is Mr. Greim. Just very quickly, in two sentences. 5 
8 You know, we're here notwithstanding an ongoing litigation in the Eastern District 
9 of Wisconsin, and we're here without waiver of any of the legal arguments we've made 
10 there, including our legislative privilege argument. And we'll be listening to the 
11 questions and potentially may raise that if the questions intrude upon that privilege, but 
12 we don't expect them to do so. 
13 That's all I have. Thank you, 
14 Great. 
15 And I should have probably done this at the outset, but before you read your 
16 statement, can I just ask you, sir, to state your name and spell your last name for the 
17 record? 
18 Speaker Vos. Sure. My name is Robin Vos, R-o-b-i-n, last name Vos, V, like 
19 Victor, o-s, like Susan. 
20 
21 Great. Thank you, Speaker Vos. 
If you could go ahead. And whatever information or statement you want to 
22 share before we begin, now is the time. 
23 
24 
25 Speaker Vos. Thank you, Mr. 
And good afternoon to those who are joining us. 
At the outset, I wanted to lay a little bit of the facts surrounding my  6 
1 communications with former President Donald Trump regarding the 2020 Presidential 
2 election. 
3 I first met the President in passing at various political events, like an awful lot of 
4 elected officials do. 
5 In August of 2021, the President invited me to travel with him to a rally he was 
6 hosting in Alabama. From that time until July of 2022, President Trump and I had 
7 approximately ten sporadic phone calls. During these calls the President and I discussed 
8 all kinds of different matters, but most likely politics, golf, and things like that. 
9 On occasion, the President would raise the issue of the 2020 Presidential election 
10 and ask about the efforts in Wisconsin. I listened to the President and provided him 
11 with general updates on activities of the Wisconsin Assembly and the status of election 
12 reform legislation in our State. 
13 On July 8th of 2022, the Wisconsin Supreme Court issued a ruling concerning the 
14 use of advance ballot drop boxes in future Wisconsin elections. 
15 The next day I received a call from President Trump. He discussed the opinion 
16 and told me we've got to do something about it. He did not elaborate on what the 
17 something was that he wanted me to do, and I did not know specifically what action he 
18 was discussing that the President wanted the legislature to take. 
19 I informed President Trump that under the Constitution there was nothing we 
20 could do. 
21 That was the extent of our conversation. The call only lasted approximately 
22 10 minutes, and I have not spoken to President Trump since that time. 
23 So with that, I am happy to answer any questions that you have, and I appreciate 
24 you giving me the opportunity to at least put some of the facts that I know on the official 
25 record.  7 
1 Great. Thank you. 
2 Well, we certainly --that is helpful, and we'll certainly dig in on some of those 
3 issues that you've raised in your statement, and I'll want to ask some more detailed 
4 questions about them. But that gives us a good roadmap to follow over the course of 
5 the interview. 
6 EXAMINATION 
7 BY 
8 Q Before we get into those questions, could you just describe very briefly your 
9 sort of educational and career background? 
10 A Oh, sure. I was born and raised in Burlington, Wisconsin. I went to the 
11 University of Wisconsin-Whitewater. I worked in the Capitol for about 5 years, left, 
12 worked for a Member of Congress for a couple years. 
13 Then I left public service, bought my own company, ran for the legislature in 2004, 
14 was elected speaker in 2013, and have served in that role ever since. 
15 Q So the only elected office that you've held has been the Wisconsin State 
16 Assembly? 
17 A I actually was also elected to the Racine County Board of Supervisors for 
18 about a decade, from 1994 to 2004. 
19 Q 
20 Assembly? 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A And is it correct you're the longest-serving member of the Wisconsin 
Longest-serving speaker, not the longest-serving member. 
Were you on the ballot in 2020? 
I was. 
For State Assembly? 
Correct.  1 
2 
3 Q 
A 
Q Did you campaign for President Trump in 2020? 
I did. 
What was the nature of your campaign work or activities on behalf of 
4 President Trump? 8 
5 A I was actually a delegate to the Republican National Convention on his behalf 
6 even though, of course, we didn't have the convention. And like other people running 
7 for office, I put up yard signs, I encouraged people as I went door to door to support the 
8 Republican ticket. More or less traditional campaign activities. 
9 
10 Q 
A Did you appear at any rallies with the President --former President? 
I don't believe so, but I did attend several events where he was at --he was 
11 present. I went to one rally where I was on the stage with him, but that was the only 
12 one. I don't recall if it was during the 2020 cycle or before. 
13 Q Any conversations with the former President during the 2020 sort of 
14 campaign cycle? So, say, from the summer of 2020 through the election in November 
15 of 2020, did you have any conversations with President Trump? 
16 A Nothing meaningful, other than being at an event in a receiving line where 
17 you shake his hand and say, "Nice to see you," right? Nothing meaningful. 
18 Q Okay. I've seen a photograph --and we can pull it up if necessary --I think 
19 it was in connection with the WISN interview, which we'll talk a little bit about. And in 
20 the context of that piece, they had a photo --there it is, has brought it up on the 
21 screen --of you with the President. 
22 Is that --that's the two of you, isn't it? 
23 
24 
25 One? A 
Q Yeah. 
And it looks to be on an airplane, like a private plane. Is that Air Force  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 A No, it's not Air Force One. 
Q Do you know when this photograph was taken? 
A It would have been approximately August of 2021. 
Q Okay. So after the 20 --certainly after the 2020 election? 
A Oh, yes. 
Q Okay. Did you ever --had you traveled with the President before that? 
A No. 
Q How about since? 
A No. 
Q What were the circumstances that led to you traveling or flying with 
11 President Trump in or around August of 2021? 
12 A I was invited to attend a rally with him in Alabama. Arrangements were 
13 made for me to fly to New Jersey. I boarded the plane at the private airport where it 
14 took off from. I rode with him to Alabama, attended the rally, and flew back, and then 
15 flew home. 
Q Do you know why you were asked to attend the rally in Alabama? 
A I don't specifically, no. 
Q What was the --this is after the President had left office? 
A Oh, yeah, uh-huh, yep. 9 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 Q What was the nature of the rally? Was it on behalf of a political candidate? 
A I actually don't know. My understanding was it was something for the 
22 Alabama Republican Party. I believe it was one of his typical rallies that he does around 
23 the country. 
24 
25 Q And you don't know why it was that you were asked to attend with him? 
A No. I mean, I assume, but I don't know why. I mean, I have my own idea  1 why, but I don't know specifically why. 
2 
3 Q 
A What's your assumption on that? 
We had started looking into some of the concerns that folks had during the 10 
4 2020 election cycle with issues that had occurred, and I think they wanted me to give the 
5 President an update on what was occurring. 
6 Q Who reached out to you to suggest --or to ask that you attend the rally in 
7 Alabama in August of 2021? 
8 
9 A 
Q I think it was Reince Priebus. 
And did you, in fact, give the President --or, at that point, the former 
10 President --an update as to the activities that you just referred to? 
11 
12 A 
Q Yes. 
What was the nature of that, or what was the status report, or what did you 
13 tell former President Trump regarding the activities in Wisconsin at that time? 
14 A I had told him about some of the issues that we had discovered. There 
15 were accusations of fraudulent ballots that were cast in a nursing home. There were 
16 concerns that folks had about absentee ballot boxes. Things like that. 
17 We had just begun an investigation in Wisconsin, and I updated him on some of 
18 the things that were occurring. 
19 
20 Q Let me --I want to go back in time a bit. 
I know in your statement you said that you had a number of contacts with former 
21 President Trump between August of 2021 and July of 2022. I want to focus on the time 
22 frame between the election and August of 2021. 
23 Did you have any interactions with President Trump in that time frame? 
24 
25 A 
Q No. 
So from November 2020 to August 2021?  1 
2 A 
Q None. 
Did you have any interactions with anyone in the Trump administration or 
3 attorneys working on behalf of President Trump in the November 2020 through 
4 August 2021 time frame? 
5 A Not that I can recall, huh-uh. 11 
6 Q So I assume you're generally aware that after the election, on November 3rd 
7 of 2020, but leading into January of 2021, the President and others acting on his behalf 
8 were questioning the legitimacy of the election and taking steps to potentially overturn 
9 the results of the election. 
10 Were you generally aware that those actions or activities were underway? 
11 
12 A 
Q I saw press reports. 
And there was a legal team. Rudy Giuliani was one of the prominent 
13 members of that legal team that was involved in that effort. 
14 Did you ever have any interactions with Mr. Giuliani or anyone acting with him in 
15 that November 2020 to January 2021 time frame? 
16 
17 A 
Q No. 
Did anyone on behalf of the President ever contact you in that 
18 November 2020 to January 2021 time frame regarding potential irregularities or fraud 
19 that they believed had taken place in Wisconsin? 
20 A Not that I recall, no. 
21 Q When is the first time that you remember having any interactions with either 
22 the former President or anyone acting on his behalf regarding claims of election fraud or 
23 irregularities in Wisconsin in the 2020 election? 
24 A The first conversation I had with Donald Trump that was anything more 
25 than, as I said, a grip-and-greet, was on that plane in August of 2021.  12 
1 Q Okay. And then how about anyone else acting on his behalf? Did anyone 
2 prior to August of 2021 ever reach out to you or contact you regarding claims of election 
3 fraud or irregularities in Wisconsin in the 2020 election? 
4 A Not specifically from the President, no. I mean, of course, in Wisconsin 
5 there was a great deal of consternation about the election, so it was a fairly normal topic 
6 in the political sphere. 
7 Q Sure. But I'm broadening my question. 
8 Understanding that there were a lot of people talking about those issues in that 
9 time frame in your State --and I understand that you didn't have any conversations with 
10 the former President on those issues --but how about others working on his behalf? 
11 And I mean formally working on his behalf. So attorneys, members of the 
12 administration, others, other close allies of the President. 
13 Did any of them reach out to you or talk with you about claims of fraud or 
14 irregularities in the 2020 election? 
15 A Not those specific claims. I mean, Reince and I lived together in college, so 
16 we talk on a fairly regular basis. So, you know, I think that was more of a friendly 
17 conversation. So I want to say yes, I speak to Reince fairly often, but it wasn't 
18 specifically about this. 
19 Q Okay. And other than Mr. Priebus, anybody else? 
20 
21 A 
Q No. 
And so I take it then that in that time frame --and, again, I'm focusing on the 
22 November 2020 to January 2021 time frame --that you didn't have any discussions with 
23 anyone associated with President Trump regarding potential action that the Wisconsin 
24 Legislature might take with respect to the 2020 election? 
25 A Not that I recall.  13 
1 Q So, again, just to sort of set some context here or be more specific about 
2 what I'm asking about, you may have heard of various efforts that were taken in States 
3 around the country to change the results of the election in those States in that time 
4 frame that I'm referring to. 
5 Are you generally familiar with the fact that such activities were underway or had 
6 taken place? 
7 
8 A 
Q I've read about it afterwards. I didn't really know about it at the time. 
Okay. So you've read that in Georgia, in Pennsylvania and Michigan and 
9 some other contested States there were efforts made to contact legislators or to take 
10 certain actions by the --the Trump campaign was urging action by legislatures in those 
11 States, to take some action with respect to the 2020 election. 
12 Were you --have you become aware of that? 
13 
14 A 
Q Yes. 
Were there any such actions that you were aware of in Wisconsin in that 
15 same time frame? 
16 A Not that I was involved in. And I think perhaps --I don't know how other 
17 States organize themselves, but we have a process where the Governor certifies the 
18 election. And once the election is certified, it's kind of out of our hands. 
19 So I don't know if other States had a different mechanism, but that's why I just --I 
20 don't recall it. 
21 Q Okay. Well, in many other States in which that same mechanism was in 
22 place the Trump campaign or attorneys acting on behalf of President Trump nevertheless 
23 reached out to and had interactions with legislators in an effort to try to have the 
24 legislatures take steps to change the results of the election. 
25 Did that happen in Wisconsin, to your knowledge?  1 
2 A 
Q I don't recall that, no. 
No one reached out to you to ask you to take such measures in the 
3 November to January time frame? 
4 
5 A 
Q Not that I recall. 
I'm sure you've also heard or read about efforts in various States to have 
6 alternate slates of electors appointed in connection with the 2020 election. 
7 Were you part of any discussions in the aftermath of the 2020 election to have 
8 alternate slates of electors appointed in Wisconsin? 
9 
10 A 
Q None. Nope. 
Okay. After January 6th, so this is --yeah, after January 6th but before 14 
11 President Biden was inaugurated, so in that 2 weeks in January of 2021, did you have any 
12 interactions with anyone acting on behalf of the Trump campaign or any member of the 
13 Trump administration? 
14 
15 A 
Q Oh, I don't remember. 
Okay. Since the President left office in --on January 20th of 2021, I 
16 think --have you described for us the nature, general nature of your interactions with him 
17 since that time? 
18 
19 A 
Q Yes. 
So that would be --the first interaction after that date of January 20th, 2020 
20 [sic], would be your interaction with respect to the Alabama rally in August of 2021. 
21 
22 A Correct. 
~ Okay. I want to walk through some of those ten or so sporadic 
23 conversations that you had with the President --or the former President --in that sort of 
24 2021-2022 time frame. 
25 But before I do, I want to pause here to see if anyone else on the call has any  15 
1 questions on these first issues that we've covered. 
2 Ms. Cheney? 
3 
4 
5 Ms. Cheney. Thanks, 
Speaker Vos, thank you for being here today. 
You mentioned that Reince Priebus had been the one potentially who connected 
6 you with President Trump to go to this rally. Can you tell us about that discussion? 
7 Speaker Vos. Sure. As I mentioned before, Reince and I have been friends 
8 since we were kids. We were involved in the Republican Party together. So Reince 
9 reached out to me saying that, "Perhaps it would be a good idea for you to give an update 
10 to President Trump on the good things that you are doing in Wisconsin." So that's what 
11 I did. 
12 Ms. Cheney. And have you had other conversations with Mr. Priebus about the 
13 Wisconsin Presidential results? 
14 
15 
16 Speaker Vos. You mean in general? 
Ms. Cheney. I mean --I'm sorry --the 2020 Presidential election in Wisconsin. 
Speaker Vos. After that time, not many. We mostly talk about the future. 
17 have been trying to focus on 2022 and beyond and not look backwards. 
18 Ms. Cheney. Has Mr. Priebus expressed a view to you about efforts to overturn 
19 the results of the 2020 election in Wisconsin? 
20 Speaker Vos. Not really, no. We didn't talk about that specifically. It was 
21 more about the interactions with President Trump and, you know, the opportunity to give 
22 him information to hopefully make sure he's informed about what's happening in 
23 Wisconsin. 
24 Ms. Cheney. And did Mr. Priebus indicate to you why he thought that was 
25 important?  1 Speaker Vos. I think he was doing it to help make sure that my situation was 
2 protected as a friend, because I think there were some who were attempting to 
3 mischaracterize what was happening in Wisconsin, and he wanted to make sure that 
4 potentially wrong information was not being fed to President Trump about what was 
5 happening. 
6 Ms. Cheney. And can you --did he --can you explain a little bit more about the 
7 mischaracterization he was worried about? 
8 Speaker Vos. Well, I think there were some in Wisconsin who wanted to go a 
9 dramatically different direction than where we were. I wanted to do a thorough 
10 investigation, discover if any wrongdoing had occurred, how it could be fixed with 
11 legislation going forward. 
12 There were some in Wisconsin that wanted to go backwards and attempt to do 
13 something different in 2020, which I have consistently said is unconstitutionally 
14 impossible. And I think he wanted to make sure that I had the chance to tell that and 
15 not have others do it on my behalf, perhaps in error. 
16 
17 
18 
19 Ms. Cheney. Okay. Thank you. 
Speaker Vos. Thank you. 
BY-: 
Q If I could follow up on that a little bit. 
20 Did Mr. Priebus tell you that President Trump was one of the people who was 
21 thinking of --or wanted to look back and maybe do something to change the 2020 
22 election? 
23 
24 A 
Q No, he never said that to me. 
Did he tell you that Mr. Trump was more sympathetic to one side or the 
25 other in that sort of--that discussion or the debate that you've just described? 16  17 
1 A We never really got into the specifics. It was much more along the lines of, 
2 "You need to make sure that you're communicating what's happening so others can't 
3 mischaracterize it." I think it was more a friend watching out for a friend, which I 
4 appreciated. 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Him watching out for you -­
Right. 
--is the way you perceived it? 
Yes. 
So maybe you've touched on this already, but can you describe for us, as 
10 best you recall, the conversations that you had with former President Trump in August 
11 of 2021 regarding what you were doing and what your --what was happening in 
12 Wisconsin and what your thoughts were about how things should proceed in Wisconsin? 
13 A We had recently launched an investigation in Wisconsin to try to get at some 
14 of the accusations that folks brought forward as to what did or did not occur in 2020. 
15 We talked about some of the things that we had hoped to bring forward, some of the 
16 accusations that had been brought up, mostly all the ones that were already in the media. 
17 And we just mostly discussed that. 
18 Now, of course, you know, I don't want to characterize where President Trump 
19 was, but, of course, he had a general belief that there were challenges and things done 
20 wrong in Wisconsin. He spent much of the time reiterating what the things that he 
21 perceived to be wrong were and hoped that we would look into some of the accusations. 
22 Q Do you recall what the things were that he reiterated or that he shared with 
23 you he felt had gone wrong in Wisconsin in 2020? 
24 A I think it focused on the general idea of unsecured ballot drop boxes, ballot 
25 harvesting occurring in Wisconsin, and the idea that you had people who were not  18 
1 allowed to legally cast a ballot. 
2 We had an incident in my own district, as an example, where nursing home 
3 residents fraudulently were given ballots taken out by somebody who was not allowed to 
4 do it on their behalf, things like that, where there were concerns about the laws on the 
5 books in Wisconsin. 
6 Q Did he tell you why it was that he was continuing to --I'll use the term 
7 "litigate" in a sort of informal sense --why he was continuing to pursue or press these 
8 issues 8 months or so after he had left office? 
9 A My general recollection was he felt like the election was unfair and did not 
10 result in a ballot that could be --in a result that could be justified, based on his 
11 knowledge. 
12 Q But did he offer any explanation as to where he felt you were --he could go 
13 with the information that you were developing in Wisconsin or why it was important to 
14 develop that information? 
15 A I think he wanted us to go backwards to try and look and see what we could 
16 do about 2020. I have consistently said we need to look forward, that it's 
17 unconstitutional and impossible for us to go back to what occurred in 2020 and have any 
18 effect on the result. 
19 It's why I prefer to talk about 2022 and 2024 and what could be changed to 
20 correct the problems that we've either discovered or we perceived to be a problem. 
21 Q Got it. And did that conversation that you've just described take place in 
22 August of 2021, or are you describing sort of a series of conversations that took place 
23 between then and July of 2022? 
24 A It was more the series, because in the beginning, of course, I spent most of 
25 the time listening. President Trump spent most of the time talking. So that's how  1 many of our conversations went. 
2 Q So I want --but I want to hone in, if I could, on that August 2021 
3 conversation or series of conversations within that trip. 
4 
5 A 
Q Okay. 
It sounds as if he shared with you, President --former President Trump 
6 shared with you concerns about the 2020 election, correct? 
Correct. 19 
7 
8 A 
Q Did he in that conversation share with you what you've described as looking 
9 backwards, the idea that something could or should be done to change the outcome of 
10 the 2020 election? 
11 A He did talk about the fact that if something was done incorrectly it has to be 
12 fixed. And I had made the case that we don't know at that point what had been done 
13 correctly or incorrectly, which is why we had an investigator hired, to discover whether or 
14 not those things did, in fact, occur. 
15 Q What I'm getting at is what it means to "fix" the situation. You've put 
16 forward very sort of clearly that you perceive fixing means making sure things don't 
17 happen in the future and don't happen again. But there's another school or camp that 
18 seemed to believe that fixing meant changing the result of the 2020 election. 
19 Am I characterizing correctly sort of this tension that you were experiencing in 
20 that time frame? 
21 A Again, if I look at it broadly, from people in Wisconsin, that is accurate. 
22 Some people thought that we could go backwards. Many of them were vociferous 
23 supporters of President Trump. But I don't recall President Trump specifically saying, 
24 "You need to go back and do X, Y, or Z." 
25 Q So that's where I was headed. In that August 2021 interaction or series of  20 
1 interactions, are you saying that it wasn't clear to you whether President Trump was in 
2 the "looking forward" camp versus the "looking backwards" camp? 
3 A He did not specifically address that to me. Obviously, if you look at media 
4 reports and other things, I understand where it seems like he was heading, but he did not 
5 say that to me specifically, like, "This is what you need to do." 
6 Understood. 
7 Ms. Cheney. 
8 
9 
10 Ms. Cheney. Thanks, 
Speaker Vos, could you just tell us what he did say to you? 
Speaker Vos. I don't recall exactly, which is --I'm trying to give a flavor of what I 
11 remember, you know, over a year ago, which was basically you need to make sure this 
12 investigation happens, you need to see where the truth is, you need to find out the fraud, 
13 you know, along those lines, because I think he generally believed that a large-scale 
14 amount of fraud occurred in Wisconsin. 
15 At that time we hadn't done the due diligence to investigate it in depth, and that's 
16 what I just described to him. That's why we hired an investigator, we began the 
17 process, which didn't conclude for another 6 months. 
18 Ms. Cheney. And did he tell you what he thought would happen if you did, 
19 quote, "fix it"? 
20 Speaker Vos. I think he believed that potentially we could go back and do 
21 something about the 2020 election. He didn't say it again specifically. I only know 
22 from the media reports. But that was the implication, that if enough fraud was found, 
23 perhaps something different could happen. 
24 Ms. Cheney. And what do you mean "something different could happen"? 
25 Speaker Vos. As far as the 2020 election, again, I have been clear and reiterated  1 over and over that we cannot go backwards. I have said that to the President multiple 
2 times. We could only look forward. 
3 
4 
5 
6 Ms. Cheney. But what did he say to you? 
SpeakerVos. When? 
Ms. Cheney. At any point in these discussions, in terms of "fixing this." 
Speaker Vos. So it was an example where you cannot allow fraud to continue, 21 
7 which is what I would retort back with and say that's why we need to fix the election laws 
8 and make sure that if anything happened in the past it can't be allowed to happen in the 
9 future. 
10 Ms. Cheney. And did the President suggest to you any evidence for his 
11 assertions that there had been fraud on a wide scale that would change the result of the 
12 election? 
13 Speaker Vos. It seems that he had watched media reports. In Wisconsin, we 
14 had some folks who would report on a large number of ballots that were cast at a nursing 
15 home that was illegal. We had issues where we had votes that were cast at a central 
16 count that many doubted the way that they were counted and the results that occurred. 
17 We had individuals who brought forward accusations of people who weren't allowed to 
18 legally cast a ballot and others with ballot harvesting occurring in Wisconsin, which is 
19 illegal. 
20 So I think there were many charges that were brought forward, and that's why I 
21 reiterated that there were lots of --there's lots of smoke, but we needed to make sure if 
22 there was actual fire. 
23 Ms. Cheney. Did you --were you aware that a number of these charges had 
24 already been litigated in State and Federal court in Wisconsin? 
25 Speaker Vos. Well, my --and I'm not a lawyer --but my understanding is that  22 
1 many of the efforts to litigate them weren't fact-based. They were thrown out on it 
2 wasn't the right court, it wasn't the right time, it wasn't the right way to bring the process 
3 forward. 
4 So that's why I think many folks in Wisconsin especially doubted the results, not 
5 because a court had reviewed it, but because of the way that the review had occurred. 
6 Ms. Cheney. I appreciate that. And I do also recognize that you're not a 
7 lawyer, so --but just I think it's important for the record to show that, in fact, a number of 
8 the cases, including the ones in Wisconsin, had been litigated on the merits, you know, 
9 including by judges Trump appointed. 
10 In the Federal district court, for example, in the Eastern District of Wisconsin, 
11 Judge Ludwig, who was appointed by President Trump, said, "On the merits of the 
12 plaintiff's claims, the Court now further concludes the plaintiff has not proved that the 
13 defendants violated his rights under the Electors Clause. To the contrary, the record 
14 shows Wisconsin's Presidential Electors are being determined in the very manner directed 
15 by the Legislature." 
16 And there are a number of those decisions where I know that the claim has been 
17 made that somehow these cases were dismissed on standing grounds or others. But, in 
18 fact, a number of them, including in Wisconsin, were decided on the merits. So --
19 
20 
21 Speaker Vos. Ms. Cheney -­
Ms. Cheney. Please go ahead. 
Speaker Vos. I'm sorry. I was going to follow the instructions to let you finish 
22 your question. I'm sorry. I'm not used to that. I appreciate that. 
23 So I think on that one specific case, though, Madam Congresswoman, I think that 
24 was one as to whether or not the electors are awarded correctly using the process we 
25 have in Wisconsin with a validation from the court. That really has nothing to do with  23 
1 fraud and whether or not fraud occurred. It was just a process that electors are 
2 awarded. 
3 So I'm not a lawyer, again, but to my understanding, that really has nothing to do 
4 with fraud. 
5 Ms. Cheney. Well, but the point is that the issue of fraud is litigated in the 
6 courts. And if the Trump campaign or any campaign had evidence of fraud, then they 
7 could, you know, present that evidence in court. 
8 And the argument that's consistently made, as you know, is somehow they didn't 
9 have a chance to have their day in court because the evidence wasn't presented and that 
10 the cases were dismissed on grounds --not on the merits, but on grounds like standing. 
11 And so I think that the overall issue is we have a process, as you know and as 
12 you've made clear, by which, you know, each State determines how its electors are 
13 selected. Each State does it by popular vote. And if candidates or campaigns have 
14 concerns about that, then they can bring those concerns to the court. There's a process 
15 that State law provides both to bring those concerns to State and Federal court to present 
16 the evidence. 
17 But as you said, you know, once the electors are certified, those decisions in 
18 Wisconsin --those efforts in Wisconsin were unsuccessful. And once the electors are 
19 certified, that's the process, and we have to abide by the rulings of the courts. 
20 So my question is, just to understand, again, exactly what President Trump was 
21 asking you to do. 
22 Speaker Vos. So, again, it wasn't specific. My general impression, if I recall 
23 correctly, again, a year ago, was the idea was we need to discover and find the fraud. 
24 think he believed quite adamantly that fraud had occurred. 
25 I explained to him that we had an investigator and a team of folks looking to see if  24 
1 there was fraud and that we would use that to build a case going forward to be able to 
2 decide whether or not legislative changes could occur. 
3 Ms. Cheney. And so, Speaker Vos, just so I understand, your testimony is 
4 President Trump never asked you to do anything specific? 
5 Speaker Vos. He never specifically said, you know, overturn the election, or any 
6 of those kind of things. It was always, "You need to find the fraud, and we need to show 
7 people what happened," that general idea. 
8 
9 fix it? 
10 
11 Ms. Cheney. And you said earlier he said to you that you should --you needed to 
Speaker Vos. Yeah, correct. 
Ms. Cheney. And I think you told us that you spent most of the time listening. 
12 So I guess I'm interested in it in, as you were listening to him, it sounds like you were 
13 explaining to him that the only fix is, if there is some problem that you've discovered, 
14 then the fix is a legislative change going forward. 
15 
16 Speaker Vos. That's correct. 
Ms. Cheney. And as he was talking to you, again, it's your testimony that he 
17 didn't suggest anything besides that? 
18 Speaker Vos. He did not give any specific recommendations. I think, you know, 
19 based on what I know, I believe that he would have liked us to use the things that we 
20 discovered to show that there were problems with the 2020 election. But he never 
21 specifically said to me, "You need to overturn the election" or do any of those kind of 
22 things. 
23 
24 
25 Ms. Cheney. Thank you. 
BY-: 
Q So would you say --how many times over the course --I was focused  25 
1 specifically on that August conversation. But in your discussion with Ms. Cheney, I think 
2 you've sort of broadened it through the series of conversations leading up to 2022. Is 
3 that right? What you were just answering to Ms. Cheney's questions --
4 A Yes. 
5 Q --related to the series of conversations. 
6 A Yes. 
7 Q During that series of conversations, roughly ten or so I think you said, how 
8 many times did you tell former President Trump that the Constitution doesn't allow us to 
9 do anything with respect to the 2020 election or any fixes need to be prospective, not 
10 retrospective, things along those lines? How many times did you have that --discuss 
11 that issue with him? 
12 
13 
14 
15 A 
Q 
A 
Q I don't recall exactly how many, but it was more than once. 
More than five? 
I don't remember. 
Okay. At any point --I know you've talked about the fact that you, in your 
16 earlier conversations, you told him that there was an investigation underway and that 
17 you were trying to get to the bottom of whether there was fraud. Is that accurate? 
18 
19 A 
Q Yes. 
At any point in this series of conversations leading up to the summer of 2022 
20 did you report back to former President Trump to tell him what your investigation had 
21 found with respect to the claims of fraud? 
22 
23 
24 A 
Q 
A Yes. 
What did you tell him in that regard? 
The one call that I remember, I had called him sometime in the early --early 
25 2022, describing a committee hearing that had occurred in Wisconsin where we had  26 
1 received an interim report from our investigator. 
2 Q Was that the only conversation that you had with President Trump 
3 regarding --former President Trump --regarding the results of the investigation that you 
4 had authorized in Wisconsin? 
5 
6 A 
Q I don't remember for certain, but I think that probably was not the only one. 
What was the nature of the report that you gave to former President Trump 
7 in that early 2022 call? 
8 A There was a report that was put forward by our investigator in testimony to 
9 our Assembly Committee on Campaigns and Elections which described some of the things 
10 that I described earlier --problems at nursing homes, issues with ballots that couldn't be 
11 corroborated, a process through which we had had some legislative changes that were 
12 built off of those problems. 
13 Q At any point did you tell former President Trump that the outcome in the 
14 Wisconsin election was not impacted by fraud in the election? 
15 
16 A 
Q Can you ask that question again? I'm sorry. 
Yeah. At any point did you tell former President Trump that the outcome 
17 in the 2020 election in Wisconsin was not impacted by these allegations of fraud that 
18 have been raised? 
19 A No. 
20 Q I want to talk about the July 2022 call that you've described as taking place 
21 on July 9th. But before I do, just prior to that call, do you recall where things stood in 
22 terms of your conversations with President Trump, how you had left things off in your 
23 earlier --in your previous conversations? 
24 A I had attempted to wrap up our investigation in the spring of 2022. 
25 remember at the time President Trump put out a tweet saying that I should keep the  27 
1 investigation going and pressuring me to do so. 
2 Because I did not want to have folks think that we were not doing a thorough 
3 investigation, undermining our efforts, we extended the timeline by which we had the 
4 investigation continue. 
5 So I know he called me about that time urging me to keep the investigation going, 
6 to discover more concerns with the 2020 election and the way it was conducted. 
7 Q Can you tell us specifically what you remember from that phone 
8 conversation or how he framed that request? 
9 
10 A 
Q I'm sorry. The way I described it is my best recollection. 
Did he tell you that he was disappointed that you had --it appeared as if you 
11 were shutting down or ending the investigation? 
12 
13 
14 
15 A 
Q 
A 
Q Yes, he did. 
Do you recall how he expressed that concern? 
Not specifically. I'm sorry. 
Did he share with you any evidence that he had come up with or heard 
16 about that he thought required or justified a continued investigation on your end? 
17 A He reiterated some of the results from that earlier interim report from our 
18 investigators. He reiterated some of the things that had been brought forward in 
19 testimony to our Assembly Campaigns and Elections Committee, but it was nothing 
20 beyond what was already in the public purview. 
21 Q And did you say that you had --by the time you spoke with him, had you 
22 already made the decision to extend the investigation? 
23 
24 A 
Q I don't remember the exact timeline. I don't remember. 
Do you recall him being --or telling him or satisfying his request that the 
25 investigation be extended?  28 
1 A Yes. I think he wanted me to continue to be more aggressive than I was 
2 being to continue to find fraud. And I reiterated that, you know, we had good people 
3 doing that, that they had discovered most of what they had found, and that we needed to 
4 look forward toward the election and making sure we had a Republican Governor, a 
5 Republican Attorney General to be able to put our actual election reforms into place 
6 rather than looking backward. 
7 
8 Q 
A Do you recall how he responded to that? 
He, again, reiterated the fact that if we don't focus on 2020, we can't win 
9 going forward. I disagreed, saying that we need to learn from 2020 and use that as the 
10 reasons that reforms need to occur, not to look backward. 
11 Q Okay. And was that the last conversation that you had with former 
12 President Trump prior to the July 9th conversation that you've described? 
13 A I think so, but I don't remember if it was exactly the last one. 
14 Q And I'll note for the record that Congressman Schiff has joined us. 
15 So let's talk about the July 9th conversation. You said in your opening statement 
16 that you believe it was prompted by a July 8th Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling regarding 
17 the use of advance ballot drop boxes in future Wisconsin elections. 
18 Is it your understanding that that Supreme Court case related to future elections 
19 in Wisconsin? 
20 
21 A 
Q Yes. 
Was it your understanding that that ruling did not have any retroactive 
22 effect or wasn't even in --that the case that gave rise to that ruling was not a challenge to 
23 the 2020 election results? 
24 A I know that the ruling had no effect on the 2020 election. I don't know the 
25 underlying rationale.  29 
1 Q And President --former President Trump called you the day after that ruling 
2 was issued? 
3 
4 
5 A 
Q 
A Correct. 
What did he say to you during that call? 
"You now have all the evidence that you need to fix what's happened." 
6 And I reiterated the idea that we could not go backward and deal with 2020. We could 
7 only use it as evidence to build support for our Republican candidates, because we had 
8 already adjourned our legislative session, to be able to build up the support for the 
9 reforms that we should be able to enact in January with a different Governor in charge. 
10 Q Did you tell former President Trump what you just told us, which is that the 
11 ruling by the Supreme Court was not intended to or did not impact the 2020 election? 
12 
13 
14 A 
Q 
A I did. 
How did he respond to that? 
He was not happy. He disagreed with me, thought that I wasn't being 
15 strong enough, and that we needed to be more outspoken in raising this issue so the 
16 public understands the challenges before us. 
17 Q You've said publicly that --in an interview with a local TV station --that 
18 President Trump --former President Trump in that conversation told you that he would 
19 like you to do something different in Wisconsin. 
20 
21 
22 A 
Q 
A Uh-huh. 
What did you mean by that? 
Well, the way I took it was that we needed to focus on getting the election 
23 fraud issue out there because we now had a Wisconsin Supreme Court case showing how 
24 absentee ballot drop boxes were used illegally in Wisconsin. 
25 And what I said to him was, again, the issue was about going forward, not being  30 
1 able to use them in future elections, not going backwards saying that ballots that were 
2 cast were illegal, because the Supreme Court did not say that in Wisconsin. 
3 Q But former President Trump wanted you to say that, right, to say that the 
4 ballots that had been cast in 2020 were illegal or improper or something should happen 
5 with those ballots? 
6 A I think that was his belief, but you'd have to ask him to know exactly what he 
7 thought. 
8 
9 
10 Q 
A 
Q Well, you understood that that was what he was asking, right? 
That's what I believed, yeah. 
And you said in your interview that you told him that what he was asking for 
11 was not allowed under the State constitution, right? 
12 
13 A 
Q Correct. Yeah, I said we can't go back. 
So you must have had --in order to respond that way, you must have had 
14 some sense of what he was asking for, otherwise you wouldn't be able to tell him it was 
15 or wasn't constitutional, right? 
16 A Right. I mean, the general sense was looking backward, and I had tried in 
17 every public statement that I put out and in every interview that I've done to reiterate 
18 that you can't go back and litigate something that's already been certified and done. 
19 You could only look forward. 
20 Q And you don't, as you sit here today, you don't recall how he framed what it 
21 was that he wanted you to do that prompted your response that, "Hey, we can't do 
22 that"? 
23 A No, because most of the conversation was him iterating what he believed 
24 the Wisconsin Supreme Court decided, which I fundamentally disagreed with, because it 
25 was --he thought it was about looking backwards. I thought, and now I know, that it  1 was about what could happen going forward. 
2 
3 
4 Q 
A 
Q You said the conversation lasted about 10 minutes. Is that right? 
Approximately, yeah. 
Have you described the sum and substance of that conversation for us? 
5 mean, have you already just covered everything that came up in that 10-minute call? 31 
6 A Yeah. I mean, other than the fact that at the end I could sense he was not 
7 satisfied with my answers. But that's the way it is. 
Upon what did you base that sense? 8 
9 Q 
A He brought up my primary opponent and thought that people in my district 
10 would not be happy with my answers. 
Tell me --or tell us exactly what he said in that regard. 11 
12 Q 
A I don't remember exactly what he said, but it was more or less, you know, "I 
13 understand you have a competitive primary. You know, people in Wisconsin and 
14 your --and people in Wisconsin" --he didn't say my district --"people in Wisconsin aren't 
15 going to be happy if this is all you're willing to do." 
16 
17 
18 Q 
A 
Q Meaning if you're not willing to do something to impact the 2020 election? 
He didn't say that, so you could infer what it meant. 
What he said was, "If this is all you're willing to do," that's what you recall 
19 him saying? 
20 
21 
22 A Correct. 
Mr. Ms. Cheney. 
Ms. Cheney. Speaker Vos, in that interview you said, as Mr. 
23 "He would like us to do something different in Wisconsin." just indicated, 
24 So I'm just trying to understand exactly what he --what it was he wanted you to 
25 do.  32 
1 Speaker Vos. Well, I think it was be more assertive, talk more about what is 
2 perceived to be the fraud in the 2020 election, be more forceful. I don't think he liked 
3 the fact that I consistently said we can only do things going forward, not looking back. 
4 There were an awful lot of voters in Wisconsin, as I'm sure you can empathize 
5 with, there were an awful lot of voters who wanted us to spend time looking backwards. 
6 I think he fed into that mindset, and I just fundamentally disagreed with it. 
7 Ms. Cheney. But "speak more aggressively" doesn't seem like that would lead 
8 you to say that's not allowed under the Constitution. 
9 Speaker Vos. Well, he wanted us to do things that aren't even allowed. We 
10 were out of session. So if I wanted to go back in and pass a law or do anything, it's not 
11 possible because we were already adjourned. 
12 So, you know, I guess in my mind, I knew that there was no other possibility as 
13 opposed to going forward. So no matter what he pushed for, which was for me to do 
14 more, be more aggressive, be more assertive, he didn't really understand the legislative 
15 calendar or how the process specifically worked in our legislature. 
16 So that's why I guess I didn't give a whole lot of second thought to it, because I 
17 knew most of those things weren't possible. 
18 Ms. Cheney. So the things that he was asking you to do, are you suggesting they 
19 would have been possible if your legislature had been in session? 
20 Speaker Vos. Possibly. I mean, as an example, past election law changes, we 
21 did 19 different bills in Wisconsin. They were all vetoed by Governor Evers. 
22 So I tried to make the case that we know problems existed. We passed 
23 legislative fixes to address what those were. They were vetoed by the Governor. And 
24 the only answer in our system is to have a new Governor who would be willing to sign 
25 those legislative fixes.  1 Ms. Cheney. So, Speaker Vos, I just want to make sure that you are really 
2 focused on the question I'm asking. 
3 
4 Speaker Vos. Okay. 
Ms. Cheney. Because you said, "He would like us to do something different in 
5 Wisconsin, and I explained it's not allowed under the Constitution. He has a different 
6 opinion." 
7 And so we're trying to understand exactly what it was he wanted you to do 
8 differently. It's not a complicated question. 33 
9 Speaker Vos. And I don't think it's a complicated answer, because he wanted us 
10 to look backwards, he wanted us to focus on --
11 Ms. Cheney. When you say look --I'm sorry, Speaker Vos. But just when you 
12 say look backwards, how did you know he wanted you to look backwards? And what 
13 does that mean? 
14 Speaker Vos. Well, he spent most of his time bringing up the issues that we had 
15 already discovered or we thought had happened in 2020. I think he felt in the 
16 discussions that we had that we should be able to go back and somehow address things 
17 that happened in 2020 after the electors were certified. 
18 You know, we never got into the specifics. Frankly, I'm sure you've had 
19 conversations with the President, it's mostly generalities. It's not a great deal of 
20 specifics. 
21 But I think that in the discussions that we had, he never said, "I want you to do X, 
22 Y, or Z." It was just, "You're not being strong enough. The voters are disappointed. 
23 You need to look and say if somebody, you know, stole the election. You can't just let 
24 this kind of thing happen." Right? It wasn't specifically like do X, Y, or Z. 
25 So the way I always took those conversations is we need to pass legislation to fix  34 
1 the problems that we have discovered. That's what I would try to reiterate to the 
2 President and why I kept saying we need to look forward, elect a Republican Governor, 
3 have an Attorney General who will prosecute fraud that is found. Unfortunately, none 
4 of those were allowed under the system that we have. 
5 Ms. Cheney. Well, those things that you just mentioned would be allowed, right, 
6 elect a new Governor --
7 Speaker Vos. No, agreed. But it's because we didn't have those people in 
8 office already who would look into it. We had an Attorney General who had dismissed 
9 the accusations, wouldn't even look into them. We had a Governor who wouldn't sign 
10 any election reform bill. 
11 So until we had new people in office I didn't have another solution. 
12 Ms. Cheney. Right. But I think the question is if the discussion had been one in 
13 which there was agreement about that, which, you know, the President --President 
14 Trump was agreeing with you, then it seems like you --the way that you've described it in 
15 the press wouldn't be accurate. 
16 Speaker Vos. No, it's because he didn't think that was aggressive enough. He 
17 thought that --you know, my words, he thought that was a cop-out. He thought we 
18 should be more aggressive, we should be out there, you know, kind of more or less 
19 talking to people on a regular basis, all those kind of things. 
20 And I think we were. But looking backwards, there was no way that we could 
21 address anything that occurred in 2020 like I think he would have liked to try to say how 
22 could a different result have occurred when that could only occur going forward, not 
23 going backward. 
24 Ms. Cheney. Okay. Thanks. 
25 BY  35 
1 Q Speaker Vos, let me ask you, at the time of that call or prior to that call, you 
2 had previously had discussions with other people regarding this notion of decertifying the 
3 2020 election, correct? 
4 
5 A 
Q Correct. 
I think you've been quoted in some interviews as saying that people were 
6 asking you to overturn the election, and you would tell them you can't just --"I can't just 
7 snap my fingers or wish that I could decertify the election. You cannot decertify the 
8 election." 
9 Is that accurate? 
10 
11 A 
Q Hundred percent, yeah. 
In fact, you spoke at a State convention in May in which you said there's no 
12 ability to decertify the election and go back and nullify it, right? 
13 
14 A 
Q Correct, yeah. 
So this concept of looking back and changing the election results in 2020, it 
15 was still being discussed in your State in 2022 by some people? 
16 
17 
18 
19 A 
Q 
A 
Q By a small number, but yes. 
Enough who booed you at that convention when you said it. 
Yeah, that's true. Yeah. 
And on the heels of that, so a couple months later, you're on this call with 
20 President Trump, and he's talking about doing something different. 
21 Was he talking about --I know he didn't use the word --but was he talking about 
22 this decertification or nullification of the 2020 result? 
23 A Well, he certainly could have. Once again, it wasn't specific. But that 
24 general tone of we need to do something different. 
25 In Wisconsin there were plenty of people, especially on one extreme of our party,  36 
1 who thought we could unconstitutionally decertify or change the election. I don't recall 
2 President Trump ever using those words with me, but I do recall plenty of other people 
3 associated with him in private and public doing so. 
4 Q But in response to Ms. Cheney's or following up on Ms. Cheney's questions 
5 about what it was about something different, it seems like you understood, based on 
6 your response, if it's not allowed under the Constitution and so forth, that you 
7 interpreted his request to do something different to mean nullify, decertify, or change the 
8 2020 outcome. 
9 Is that not an accurate description of how you perceived his remarks at the time? 
10 A I think it's accurate. But, again, it was never specific. It was my 
11 impression. 
12 And, again, to be honest, you know, you had a lot of people making that case. So 
13 it was fairly --I don't know how to put this. I would say it was a common topic, 
14 especially in the Republican primary, of whether or not the 2020 election was valid and 
15 whether or not we had been aggressive enough. 
16 So I took it to be that we needed to be more aggressive, because he never 
17 specifically used those words, but certainly I think that when you look backwards, as 
18 some folks wanted to, they wanted us to do things which I know are clearly impossible 
19 and were unconstitutional, which is what I have tried to legitimately over and over say, is 
20 that you can't go backwards. 
21 Q Did anyone in this time frame --and talking about in 2022, let's just leave it 
22 at 2022 --actually, I'll broaden it, all the way back to 2021 through 2022. 
23 Did anyone associated with former President Trump --and I mean former 
24 administration officials, lawyers who you know worked for him or worked for the 
25 campaign --did any of those people ever raise with you this issue of decertifying or  37 
1 nullifying the 2020 election results in Wisconsin? 
2 A Yes.  1 
2 [4:13 p.m.] 
3 BY-: 
4 
5 
6 Q 
A Who? 
Yes. 
Mr. Eastman. He came and spoke to a panel of the legislature, and I had a 
7 meeting with him and a few other activists where they tried to make the case that we 
8 could decertify and withdraw our electors. 38 
9 I listened and at the end explained again that that was not what I understood nor 
10 possible, because at the time, President Trump's own attorney, Jim Troupis in Wisconsin, 
11 our own legislative counsel, nonpartisan, and a conservative legal firm called the 
12 Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty all said it was impossible. 
13 And, frankly, in that meeting, Mr. Esenberg from WILL and Mr. Troupis were both 
14 on a conference call as he made his points and we all said it could not happen. 
15 So even people who were associated with Mr. Trump personally disagreed with 
16 that, while others who were associated with him said we could do it. So there was a 
17 difference of opinion. 
18 Q Got it. And you said the "he" in that last sentence, the person who was 
19 arguing that you could do it, that's Mr. Eastman --or Dr. Eastman? 
20 
21 A 
Q Correct, uh-huh. 
Anyone else that you know of or you interacted with --not know 
22 of --anyone else that you interacted with who you know to have been affiliated with 
23 President Trump or his campaign who requested or suggested that you could decertify 
24 the 2020 election? 
25 A No. That was really the only interaction that I recall where people  39 
1 specifically came in saying that they thought that was possible. 
2 Q I think you said this at the outset, but is it accurate that since that July 9th 
3 call you've not spoken to former President Trump? 
4 
5 A 
Q That's correct, since --especially since he endorsed my primary opponent. 
And he issued some --I guess they're not tweets --some posts on Truth 
6 Social regarding you and your conversation with him, alluding to your conversation with 
7 him after that conversation. Is that correct? 
8 
9 A 
Q Correct. 
Okay. Anything else from anyone else on the call on the topic of the phone 
10 conversations or interactions with former President Trump since the election? 
11 
12 A 
Q [Nonverbal response.] 
Okay. Speaker Vos, I just have a few other sort of broader questions, and 
13 we've asked this of several other witnesses, and I just want to make sure we're being 
14 clear for the record. 
15 Are you able to share with us how it is you came to have Mr. Greim representing 
16 you? 
17 Mr. Greim. We're going to object to that. That's beyond the scope. And I 
18 would tell the witness not to answer that question. 
19 
20 
21 - Ms. Cheney. 
Ms. Cheney. Yeah. Thank you very much. 
It's actually not beyond our scope. I think you probably --you may have seen 
22 that we have significant concerns in a number of instances about the extent to which 
23 Trump entities or others are providing funding and financing for legal representation for 
24 some of the witnesses in our investigation. So it's actually directly related to a number 
25 of issues connected to some of the efforts to prevent the committee from getting  40 
1 information that we need. 
2 Speaker Vos. Well, I don't mind answering that. 
3 There is no funding, there is no link whatsoever between my being here today and 
4 anyone associated with the Trump organization. 
5 
6 So that's not accurate. This is all being done as an official function of my job. 
Ms. Cheney. And how, Mr. Vos --or Speaker Vos --did you come to be 
7 connected with Mr. Greim? 
8 Mr. Greim. And again, that's --the committee has no business knowing that, has 
9 no business inquiring into this. And I would tell the witness it's beyond the scope. 
10 There's no reason to answer that question. 
11 Ms. Cheney. I'd like to take a break,-. We'll come back. Could we 
12 just take about a 5-minute break? 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 - Sure. 
Ms. Cheney. Thanks. 
Let's go off the record. 
[Recess.] 
Ms. Cheney. 
Ms. Cheney. Thank you. 
So I'll just ask the question again and note that every other witness has been 
20 willing to answer this question. So the question about, Mr. Vos, how you were 
21 connected with Mr. Whitaker --I'm sorry, not Mr. Whitaker, with Mr. Greim. 
22 Mr. Greim. And I would just say that that's a false statement. Not every other 
23 witness has been willing to answer that question. 
24 
25 Ms. Cheney. Every other witness --
Mr. Greim. And I'm instructing the witness not to answer that question.  41 
1 Ms. Cheney. It's not a false statement, Mr. Greim. Every other witness that 
2 we've asked has answered this question. 
3 And so if you're unwilling to answer the question, we will note for the record that 
4 your client --you've instructed your client not to tell the committee how he came to have 
5 you as his counsel. 
6 
7 Mr. Greim. Fair enough. 
Ms. Cheney. Thank you. We appreciate it. 
8 We'll also be sure to note this in the section of our report that covers the extent to 
9 which Donald Trump and those affiliated with him have worked to ensure representation 
10 in a way that has at times served certainly to prevent the committee from getting access 
11 to information. 
Okay. Anything else? Anyone else on the line have any further 
14 questions for Speaker Vos? 
15 No thanks,. 
16 Okay. Then, with that, we can go off the record. 
17 
18 
19 
20 Thank you both for your time today. I appreciate it. 
Mr. Greim. Thank you. Have a good day. 
Speaker Vos. Bye.
