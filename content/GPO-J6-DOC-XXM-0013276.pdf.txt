Hi Tim -
I see that the election defense fund is directing an increasingly large share of donations to the Save America 
PAC, rather than toward the legal efforts advertised in large print to supporters. 
75% of contributions are now going to Save America --up from the 60% that was being funneled to the PAC 
last week. 
Previously, 60% of contributions were going to retire campaign debt. And before that, 95% of contributions 
were going to the RNC's operating account. 
• Why is the campaign telling its supporters they are contributing toward an "Election Defense Fund" if 
only a small percentage of those funds are actually going toward funding legal efforts? 
• How can the campaign justify directing 75% of contributions intended for a 2020 legal fund toward the 
President's political action committee? 
• Is Save America doing funding any of these 2020 recount efforts or legal challenges? 
XXM-0013276  • How much money has the Trump Make America Great Again Committee raised for the legal efforts 
related to 2020 election challenges and recounts? 
• How much money has TMAGAC raised total since the election? 
Hope to hear back from you this morning. 
Thanks, 
Jeremy
