I'm sure you have heard of this proposal. It is to encourage the state legislatures to 
appoint a look doors in the various states where there's been shenanigans. If I 
understand right most of those states have Republican Legislature's. It seems to be 
comport with glorified Bush as well as the Constitution. And, well highly 
controversial, it can't be much more controversial than the lunacy that were sitting 
out there now. And It would be pretty difficult because he would take governors and 
legislators with collective will and backbone to do that. Is anybody on the team 
researching and considering lobbying for that?
