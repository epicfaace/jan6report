Subject: [EXTERNAL]Trump legal defense and leadership PAC 
Hi Tim, 
Hope you're well. I'm writing a story on the president's new leadership PAC, and the fundraising 
solicitations that raise money for the PAC and the recount. 
I'm wondering-
--Experts who I've spoken to say that President Trump can't spend money out of his PAC on the recounts 
or other post-election legal proceedings. Does he disagree have a different interpretation, or plan to 
spend any of the PAC money on the recounts? 
--What are the plans for the PAC -to help candidates? Travel and host rallies? 
--Some are saying it's misleading to raise money for a committee marked on the website as an "election 
defense fund" if it's going to a leadership PAC, what is the campaign's response to that? 
My deadline is 8 p.m. tonight. 
Thanks, 
Maggie
