Couldn't we just set up an 
Eventbrite page that we own the 
login to and then have POTUS, Don 
Jr, etc tweet it 
Although last time Eventbrite shut 
down the page and emailed 
everyone that the event had been 
cancelled ....

Piper runs RAGA, I told him 
yesterday to expect a significant 
donation and to not touch it until I 
gave him further instructions 
All of the events on #JAN6 are 
unifying (except one). 
We will pool security resources and 
intelligence, buses, hotel rooms and 
so much more. 
On Wednesday, I will be hosting a 
call with the organizers of each 
event that is coming to honor Stop 
the Steal's #JAN6 call to come.

have we thought about cyber 
security for the website? we should 
assume someone will attack it and 
A) try to crash it or B) steal the data 
C) both 
We have not, any firm you'd 
recommend? 
whoever built the page should be 
able to install the proper firmware to 
protect from attacks. we can also 
ask herndon or schatz to do it 
outside of the campaign.

Hawley Stalemenl On Objecting During Electoral College Certification Process on Jan. 6 
"Following both the 2004 and 2016 elections, Democrats in Congress objected during the 
certification of electoral votes in order to raise concerns about election integrity. They were 
praised by Democratic leadership and the media when they did. And they were entitled to do so. 
But now those ofus concerned about the integrity of this election are entitled to do the same. 
"I cannot vote to certify the electoral college result on January 6 without raising the fact that 
some states, particularly Pennsylvania , failed to follow their own state election laws. And I 
cannot vote to certify without pointing out the unprecedented effort of mega corporation s, 
including Faccbook and Twitter, to interfere in this election, in support of Joe Biden. At the very 
least, Congress should investigate allegations of voter fraud and adopt measures to secure the 
integrity of our elections. But Congress has so far failed to act. 
'"For these reasons, I will follow the same practice Democrat members of Congress have in years 
past and object during the cenification process on January 6 to raise these critical issues."

they're super happy with rally. 
Ya I mean the rally was amazing 
I'm convinced it was antifa that 
broke into the Capitol 
i think that is a high possibility. 
also why the fuckkkk doesn't the 
capitol have more industrial glass. 
these ppl broke single pane

how were they not prepared at all.

i organized protests vastly more 
violent and destructive than 
anything we saw today, Joe Biden 
and Kamala Harris helped to raise 
bail money for them. This is the 
necessary context in which to 
understand their selective moral 
indignation over today's events. 
3) I was at the rally today and every 
single person I met was peaceful, 
families, pastors, mom, kids, etc. I 
am fairly convinced that the initial 
"siege" upon the Capitol was made 
by antifa dressed up as trump 
supporters to incite chaos and a 
media narrative. httQs:lf.twitter.com/

having said that, clearly several 
trump supporters followed them 
inside which was obviously wrong 
and they should be prosecuted for 
trespassing. But Capitol police shot 
and killed an unarmed 16 year older 
female trump supporter tonight. 
Where is the outrage about that? 
Can you imagine if they had shot an 
unarmed 16 year old African 
American at a BLM protest? The 
whole city would !be burning to the

4) the media will take this way too 
far and will continue to patronize 
and ignore the very legitimate 
claims of a broken election system 
and erosion of democracy. And 
these people are not going away.
