• Dominion Voting Systems Contain Chinese Technology And Parts. "The infiltration by foreign 
countries like China into election voting equipment is emerging as a growing concern among 
vendors, who are actually asking for more federal regulation as they grapple with a lack of 
domestic suppliers producing critical technologies. Top executives of the three largest voting 
machine vendors-Hart InterCivic, Dominion Voting Systems and Election Systems & Software­
told the House Administration Committee Thursday they are hoping for guidance and support 
from the Department of Homeland Security on how to secure their subcontractors." (Michaela Ross,

openings for four senior software developers in Belgrade. 'Like many of America's largest technology 
companies --which develop some of the software for their products in places like Asia, India, Ireland and 
the Mideast --some of our software development is undertaken outside the U.S. and Canada, specifically, 
in Serbia, where we have conducted operations for 10 years,' said firm spokesman Chris Riggall, in an 
email. Dominion said it takes measures 'to ensure the accuracy, integrity and security of the software we 
create for our products.' 'First, all of our software is developed in-house by DVS employees and this work 
is not outsourced to third parties. Second, we rigorously pre-screen all new hires to identify any potential 
security concerns among any personnel involved in product development. Third, we conduct extensive 
internal testing of all new software to evaluate the functionality, accuracy and security of the code 
designed for our systems,' said Riggall." (Patrick Thibodeau, "One Election-System Vendor Uses Developers In Serbia," Cunmuterv,urld

ELECTION DAY PROBLEMS 
The Dominion Voting System Experienced Technical Failures On Election Night But 
Reportedly Did Not Lead To Improper Vote Counts 
Dominion Software Was Used In Two Of The Five Michigan And Georgia Counties That Had 
Problems On Election Night 2020, And In Each Case The Software Did Not Affect The Final Vote 
Count. "The Dominion software was used in only two of the five counties that had problems in Michigan 
and Georgia, and in every instance there was a detailed explanation for what had happened. In all of the 
cases, software did not affect the vote counts. In the two Michigan counties that had mistakes, the 
inaccuracies were because of human errors, not software problems, according to the Michigan 
Department of State, county officials and election-security experts. Only one of the two Michigan counties 
used Dominion software." (Jack Nicas, "No, Dominion Voting Machines Did Not Cause Widespread Voting Problems.," The Neiv_Yurk_Time,,

Corrected To Donald Trump Winning The County With 56 Percent. "President Donald Trump 
didn't win Michigan, but he can put a small county in the victory column after an unusual second 
look at the results. Trump defeated Joe Biden in Antrim County, getting 56% of the vote, according 
to revised totals posted Thursday. Republican John James was the favorite in the Senate race. 'It 
certainly makes a lot more sense with people who are familiar with Antrim County,' said Jeremy 
Scott, deputy county administrator. Questions were raised after the county first reported a local 
landslide for Bid en, a Democrat, in an area that usually votes Republican. Officials acknowledged 
the results seemed 'skewed' and promised a second look. More than 16,000 votes were cast." 
("Small Michigan County Goes Back To The Win Column For Trump," Associated Press 11 /5/20)

• The Failure In Antrim County Michigan Was Due To A Failure To Update The Software On 
The Machines. "A failure to properly update software was the reason for a computer glitch that 
caused massive errors in unofficial election results reported from Antrim county, the Michigan 
Department of State said late Friday. And a U-M professor of computer science and engineering 
who specializes in voting systems and securities says it appears the snafu arose from an "unusual 
sequence of events very unlikely to affect any other jurisdictions." ("Antrim Vote Glitch: Expert Shares How 
County Mistakenly Flipped From Red To Blue," Detroit Free Pres.; 11/6/20) 
• 6,000 Republican Voted Were Initially Counted As Democrat Votes In Antrim County. "A 
glitch in software used to tabulate ballots in Antrim County, Michigan caused at least 6,000 
Republican votes to be counted as Democrat, according to Michigan GOP Chairwoman Laura Cox. 
The miscalculation, Cox said in a press conference, was first reported by a county clerk. A short 
investigation revealed that 4 7 counties in Michigan may have also suffered from a similar glitch 
with the same software, which could have caused some red counties to rake in a higher number of 
Democrat votes than usual." (Jordan Davidson, "Software Glitch In Michigan County Tallied 6,000 Republican Votes As Democrat,"

• The Initial Inaccurate County Was Due To Different Ballot Versions Not Being Merged 
Properly When Tabulated. "County officials correctly loaded the new version onto the scanners 
for the affected precincts, but left the old version on scanners for precincts where the ballot was 
not affected by the late change, Halderman said. So although the scanners in the tabulators 
counted all the votes in each precinct correctly, the different versions of the ballot resulted in 
problems and erroneous vote totals when the precinct results were combined in the election 
management system, a separate software package used to manage and consolidate results before 
they are reported to the state, he said." ("Antrim Vote Glitch: Expert Shares How County Mistakenly Flipped From Red To Blue,"

Causing Poll Workers To Give Out Paper Ballots And Having Superior Court Judge Extend Voting 
Hours. "The problem initially prevented voters from casting machine ballots on Election Day in Morgan 
and Spalding counties after the devices used to sign in voters at the polls failed to work, county officials 
said. Poll workers gave voters paper ballots until a workaround allowed the use of voting machines to 
resume. In response to the problem, Superior Court Judge W. Fletcher Sams extended voting hours. The

Dominion "Uploaded Something" The Night Before "Which Is Not Normal, And Caused A Glitch." 
"Dominion, which prepares the poll books for counties before elections, 'uploaded something last night, 
which is not normal, and it caused a glitch,' Marcia Ridley, the elections supervisor at the Spalding County 
Board of Elections, told POLITICO on Election Day. That glitch prevented poll workers from using the poll 
books to program smart cards that the voters insert into the voting machines." (Kim Zetter, "Georgia county Official,

The Problem Was Due To An Upload To The Machines By One Of Their Technicians The 
Night Before. "Ridley said that a representative from the two companies called her office after 
poll workers began having problems with the equipment Tuesday morning. The representative 
said the problem was due to an upload to the machines by one of their technicians overnight, 
Ridley told POLITICO. 'That is something that they don't ever do. I've never seen them update 
anything the day before the election,' Ridley said. Ridley said she did not know what the upload 
contained." (Kim Zetter, "Georgia County Official, Vendor Disagree On Cause OfElection Day Glitch," Polit/cu, 11/4/20) 
• Both Gabriel Sterling, The Voting System Implementation Manager For The Georgia 
Secretary Of State, And Dominion, Denied Marcia Ridley's Account And Claimed The Last 
Update Made Was On October 31st. "Gabriel Sterling, the voting system implementation 
manager in the Georgia secretary of state's office, later disputed that account, telling reporters on 
Nov. 9 that the log files for the poll books show that the last update to them before the election had 
been made on Oct. 31. 'There was nothing that was done to the system after that date,' he said. 
Dominion, days after the election, also denied Ridley's account. 'We have confirmed that no 
Dominion company employee contacted the county about a last-minute update to the system,' a 
Dominion spokesperson said in a statement. 'Therefore, we have alerted the Georgia Secretary of

Machines, Experienced The Glitch Not Allowing Poll Workers To Encode The Cards Properly. 
"Jennifer Doran, elections director for the Morgan County Board of Elections and Registration, said the 
issue was with how the Knowink poll books encode a voter access card that is used with the Dominion 
voting machines. When voters sign in at a voting location, poll workers insert a voter access card into the 
Poll Pad tablet and encode it for that voter. The card is then inserted into voting machines to display the 
proper ballot for that voter. The glitch apparently prevented poll workers from encoding those cards."

PRIOR PROBLEMS WITH DOMINION'S SOFTWARE/MACHINES 
Hackers Have Repeatedly Pointed Out Vulnerabilities ln Dominion's Systems 
In July 2017, Hackers At A Hacking Conference Were Able To Exploit Vulnerabilities In A 
Dominion Ballot Scanner And "Effectively Take Control Of The Machine That Counts Votes." 
"Hackers were able to use a screwdriver to get inside a ballot-scanning machine similar to what will soon 
be used across Georgia, allowing them to replace a memory card and effectively take control of the 
machine that counts votes. That was one of the vulnerabilities found in the Dominion ImageCast Precinct 
ballot scanners, according to a report Thursday from the DEF CON Voting Machine Hacking Village, a 
conference in Las Vegas where hackers tinkered last month with voting equipment to expose 
weaknesses." (Mark Niesse, "Hackers Highlight Vulnerabilities In Vote-Scanning Machines," Gov,:rrn:1Knt_T,:chnolo,;y, 9/27 /19) 
In August 2019, A Hacking Conference Found U.S. Voting Equipment Including Dominion Systems 
Were Vulnerable To Hacking, With Many Of The Reported Vulnerabilities Having Been Reported A 
Decade Earlier. "This year's event allowed hackers to test voting equipment, including e-poll books, 
optical scan paper voting devices and direct recording electronic voting machines -all certified for use 
in at least one U.S. voting jurisdiction. 'Voting Village participants were able to find new ways, or replicate 
previously published methods, of compromising every one of the devices in the room in ways that could 
alter stored vote tallies, change ballots displayed to voters, or alter the internal software that controls the 
machines,' the report said. Despite the 'disturbing' findings of the report, the authors wrote that the 
findings were 'not surprising,' particularly in light of the fact that many of the election equipment cyber 
vulnerabilities found were 'reported almost a decade earlier.' Equipment that was tested included those 
made by leading voting machines companies Election Systems and Software (ES&S) and Dominion 
Systems." (Maggie Miller, "Hacker Conference Report Details Persistent Vulnerabilities To US Voting Systems," The}--/iil 9/26/19)

Errors 
In June 2018, The Nevada Primary Elections Were Riddled With Hundreds Of Glitches On The 
Dominion Voting System, Including Double Voting And Displaying The Wrong Ballots. "For 
hundreds of Nevada voters and candidates, June's primary election did not go as planned. Officials said 
then that a spate of well-publicized voting machine problems -including glitches that left some 
candidates off of ballots or displayed the wrong slate of ballot choices -only affected a small handful of 
voters. But a Reno Gazette Journal review of public records found more than 300 reported machine 
malfunctions across the state. More than 100 were recorded in Washoe County alone, Those software 
hiccups contributed to a double-voting snafu that forced officials to call a rare special election in Clark 
County, Records reveal they also saw Washoe threatened with at least one election-challenging lawsuit

During The 2020 Georgia Primary, Dominion's Voting Machines Saw Numerous Problems, With 
Some Machines Being Delivered Late, Others Blowing Fuses, And Some Failing To Work And 
Needing A Technician To Fix. "In some cases on Tuesday, the new machines required too much extra 
power for aging polling locations, blowing fuses and never powering on. In others, workers who were still 
being trained just days before the election struggled with setup, Some pol1ing places never even received 
the machines until the morning of the election, Jonathan Banes, who served as a precinct captain at Cross 
Keys High School in suburban DeKalb County, outside Atlanta, said the voting machines failed to work as 
workers tried to boot them up beginning at 5:30 a,m. Poll workers ultimately had to call in a technician to 
fix them. 'I still don't know what it was, whether it was the PIN authorization, the physical card itself 
which is inserted into the machine to access the admin portal to manage the functions of the device, or 
what,' Mr, Banes said. The technician who came to the school fixed the problem but never explained what 
the problem \Vas, he said," (Nick Corasaniti And Stephanie Saul, "Georgia Havoc Raises New Doubts on Pricey Voting Machines," T/ie New York

• The Poll Workers Admitted That They Had Little Training In The Way Of Troubleshooting 
Scenarios, "Mr. Banes, who is 29, was operating with only four poll workers but should have had 
a dozen -many of the older workers feared contracting Covid-19 -and only two of those who 
came had been trained, he said, The training in February 'was more of an introductory course, if

somewhat well known from the state's small-scale test in the 2019 elections, when a software 
glitch in the electronic poll books caused delays in most of the six counties where the test took

losing candidates if they had followed the instruction manual, the manufacturer has told state election 
officials. Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher vehemently denied the claim. 'I read the reference guide 
three times yesterday,' she said. 'Now here does it tell you to check for this, ever.' Even as the question of 
who is to blame grew murkier, a clearer picture of the error itself emerged Monday, with the company,
