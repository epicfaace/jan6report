Thanks for reaching out Darren. For the most part this looks okay, although this copy would need further 
adjustments: 
"only to see the leads miraculously disappear as the days went by. Perhaps these leads will return as 
our legal proceedings move forward, but only if we have the resources to KEEP FIGHTING! 
This obviously insinuates the so far unsubstantiated theory of voter fraud, as well as contributions and legal 
actions will result in some sort of different outcome. You have been spot-on with other changes, so I'd say 
reference that to an objective observation on the current state of the voting process, etc. 
Let us know if you have any questions-

CONFIDENTIAL AC-0013741  Karen, 
I will NEVER stop fighting for YOU. 
My Administration is achieving things no one thought possible -the stock market is up BIG, the 
coronavirus vaccine is underway and will be completed safely very soon. 
We are accomplishing so much, which is even more reason to step up and DEFEND THE 
ELECTION! 
I'm calling on YOU to FIGHT BACK, Karen. We need to bolster our critical Election Defense 
Fund if we're going to keep going. We can't do this without you. 
Please contribute ANY AMOUNT IMMEDIATEl Y to the Official Election Defense Fund and 
you can increase your impact by 1000%. >>

I had such a big lead in all of these key battleground states late into Election night, only to see 
the leads miraculously disappear as the days went by. Perhaps these leads will return as our 
legal proceedings move forward, but only if we have the resources to KEEP FIGHTING! 
You've never let me down before, Karen and I know you won't start now. 
Contribute ANY AMOUNT RIGHT NOW to stand with me and to DEFEND the integrity of 
our Election. 
Thank you, 
Donald J. Trump 
President of the United States
