%%FirstName%%, 
What we're about to tell you is important, so we'll get right to the point. 
So far, we have 234 sworn affidavits alleging Election irregularities from just ONE county in 
Michigan. Here are the allegations: 
• EYEWITNESS saw a batch of ballots where 60% of them had the SAME signature 
• EYEWITNESS saw a batch of ballots scanned 5 times 
• EYEWITNESS saw 35 ballots counted that were NOT connected to a voter record 
• EYEWITNESS saw poll workers marking ballots with NO mark for candidates 
• VOTER said deceased son was recorded as voting TWICE 
• EYEWITNESS said provisional ballots were placed in the tabulation box 
• FAILED software that caused an error in Antrim County used in Wayne County 
• Republican challengers not readmitted but Democrats admitted 
• Republican challengers physically pushed from counting tables by officials 
• Democrats gave out packet: "Tactics to Distract Republican Challengers" 
• Republican challenges to suspect ballots ignored 
And that's only a few of them, %%FirstName%%. The potential voter fraud we're uncovering in Michigan 
is UNPRECEDENTED. We're doing everything we can to FIGHT BACK, but we can't do it without you. 
President Trump is calling on his most LOYAL defenders to step up to the front lines of this nasty battle 
and DEFEND THE ELECTION. For a short time. you can even INCREASE your impact by 1000%.
