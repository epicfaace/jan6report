Call to action has to be all about demanding immediate action -"demand honest election'' is just too soft and not

I'm fine pushing national ads to text so we can capture their information, but for local I'd ideally like to give a 
number to generate phone calls. 
Thank you!

So right now some say: 
Call your legislator. 
Text FRAUD to 88022 to demand an honest election 
National says: 
Contact your legislators. Help President Trump! Text fraud to 88022 
Or with Fox 
Text Fraud to 88022 and demand legislators fight for honest elections. wrote: 
JTA000074  We can switch it to what you have below, but in the specific states do u want the local number-so we 
don't capture their names. Or that audio and on screen it says text 88022? 
And on the national I think what we have is going to be better as it connects to the President, we get 
their name and number for future use and can direct them to the states.

Solid plan, but I think the call-to-actions should be to "contact your Governor and legislators, demand 
they inspect the machines and hear the evidence," or at least as close to that as possible. 
Don't forget we also need radio for the four states. 
Thank you Larry!

Team, 
Given the tight deadlines, it's best to update the spots as they are. That means running the 
Stop the Steal :60 and Overwhelming :30 nationally on OAN and Newsmax, and running 
"On Tape FN" :30 on Fox News. These spots will drive voters to text 88022, where we 
could identify them and then send follow up texts pushing them to call the appropriate 
number. 
From there, we can run local in these states versions to put pressure on Kemp/Ducey/WI 
and MI legislators directly: 
We cut an AZ version over "Overwhelming" with the specific call to action to call Ducey. 
We cut a GA version of "On Tape FN" with the specific call to action to call Kemp. 
We cut a MI and WI version of "Overwhelming" with specific calls to actions to call 
legislators in each state. 
Below is a review of the attached scripts" 
• National Spots 
o Stop the Steal vl 1 -adds in lines about illegals and out of state voters. For 
JTA000075  OANN andNewsmax. 
o Overwhelmmg National- updated to reference illegals and out of state voters 
voting in Nevada, and ballot mishandling in Arizona. For OANN and 
Newsmax. 
o On Tape FN vl 1: updates call to action to be "Text FRAUD to 88022" 
• Local spots: 
Larry o Overwhelmmg AZ v3: updates Overwhelmmg National to end on an AZ 
note, with a call to action displaying Ducey's office number. 
o On Tape GA v2: updates On Tape FN with more examples from the 
research provided and a call to action to call Kemp. 
o Overwhelmmg MI and WI vl: updates the end of each script to end on a 
local note and with contact info for state legislators.

I agree with Larry here. Time isn't on our side, and we have to be mindful of accelerated 
log deadlines over the next two weeks, too. I'll push for any creative that you want to 
run, but there's risk that S&P decisions will take 2-5 business days. The network cable 
approach is more cost efficient and we could get the approved spots back on-air by 
Tuesday morning. 
I'll work on radio and local budget options, but again my concern here is that we're 
JTA000076  going to run into half-staffed and unmotivated sales offices over the holiday weeks that 
will cause delays.

The Fox News approved spot took a week to get it approved 
by their legal department. So we have to consider that delay 
when it comes to creative My suggestion would be to use that 
spot with minor modifications nationally to put pressure on the 
legislators and to ensure our base across the country sees it. 
We can convert the 60 tv into radio and create new state 
specific ones. 
We will work on scripts today

Team -the President and Mayor Giuliani want 
to get back up on TV ASAP, and Jared has 
approved in budgetary concept, so here's the 
gameplan: 
Larry -you're critical in that we need ASAP 
JTA000077  feedback on how quickly we can tum around the 
updated creative, and Ben, you're critical in that 
we need you to tell us how much things cost and 
what we can get away with content-wise. No 
need to make perfect the enemy of good on 
either front. 
GOAL: 
• Motivate the GOP base to put pressure 
on the Republican Governors of Georgia 
and Arizona and the Republican­
controlled state legislatures in Wisconsin 
and Michigan to hear evidence of voter 
fraud before January 6th. So these are our 
four states we truly care about. 
MEDIUMS: 
• Conservative cable (specifically Fox, Fox 
Biz, OANN and Newsmax). 
• Conservative radio ( shows originating 
locally and nationally). 
• It is entirely up to us if we want to go with 
the national play on the cable and radio 
nets, or just go with the local insertions. 
• I do also very much like the idea of 
running our spots nationally on Fox News 
Sunday the next two weekends. 
DURATION: 
• Now/ ASAP through January 6th. 
TV AND RADIO CREATIVE: 
• The President and the Mayor both love 
the two TV spots we got approved for 
Newsmax and OANN (see below) and 
would like to keep the final product as 
close to these two existing ads as 
possible, but add in references to illegal 
aliens and out of state voters if at all 
possible, but the endings need to be 
changed to include phone numbers and 
directions to call the local Governor or 
state legislature, depending on the state, 
and most important we have to figure out 
what needs to be changed to get Fox and 
JTA000078  Fox Biz approval. 
• Ifwe take the national route, we'd need 
to put a phone number on-screen for each 
of the four targeted states, so four 
numbers in total on the endplate, but if we 
break it up and just place state-by-state, 
we only need to make a singular phone 
number push for each ad. 
• The President likes the TV:30 we finally 
got approved by Fox and Fox Biz, but 
this is really just a Georgia-specific spot 
and I don't think it really works for what 
we want to do here. 
• We obviously need radio, and we might 
want to have these be state-specific, more 
hardcore, include more specific examples 
of voter fraud (see attached), repeat the 
phone number and call to action more 
often. We 're only talking four versions, so 
maybe state-specific here is easiest. 
BUDGET: 
• No set budget, but nobody flinched when 
I said a national effort would cost $2M a 
week. The prevailing thought is that we 
have two weeks, so let's go for broke 
here. I think the max spend we want to 
put forward is $5M. 
As a reminder, these two ads ran last weekend 
nationally on N ewsmax and OANN:
