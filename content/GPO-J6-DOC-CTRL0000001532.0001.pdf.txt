'unlawful lockdowns' to begin on 6 January 2021 in Washington, D.C. An online thread discussed specific calls for 
violence to include stating 'Be ready to fight. Congress needs to hear glass breaking, doors being kicked in, and blood 
from their BLM and Pantifa slave soldiers being spilled. Get violent...stop calling this a march, or rally, or a protest. Go 
there ready for war. We get our President or we die. NOTHING else will achieve this goal." 
(U//LES) One posted commented, 'if Antifa or BLM get violent, leave them dead in the street'. 
(U//LES) Another individual commented that they needed people on standby to provide supplies, including water and 
medical, to the front lines. The individual also discussed the need to evacuate noncombatants and wounded to medical 
care (NFI). 
(U/ /LES) Additionally, perimeter maps and caravan pictures were posted. Rally points were identified in Figure 
1. A perimeter was designated around various capitol buildings identified in Figure 2. (FBI Comment. The 
caravans in Figure 1 had the same colors as the sections of the perimeter in Figure 2.)

(U/ /LES) FBI Comment. BLM likely refers to Black Lives Matter. Pantifa likely refers to Antifa. 
(U//FOUO) FBI Comment. Individuals/Organizations named in this SIR have been identified as participating in 
activities that are protected by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Their inclusion here is not 
intended to associate the protected activity with criminality or a threat to national security, or to infer that such 
protected activity itself violates federal law. However, based on known intelligence and/or specific historical 
observations, it is possible the protected activity could invite a violent reaction towards the subject individual or 
others in retaliation or with the goal of stopping the protected activity from occurring in the first instance. In the 
event no violent reaction occurs, FBI policy and federal law dictates that no further record be made of the 
protected activity. 
(U) This report has been prepared by the NORFOLK Division of the FBI. Comments and queries may be 
addressed to the NORFOLK Division at 757-455-0100.
