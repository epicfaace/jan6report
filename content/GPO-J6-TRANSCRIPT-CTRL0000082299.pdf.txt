So we'll --good afternoon.

10 Mr.- Thank you, Mr. de la Torre. 
Could you please place raise hand so you can be sworn in for the deposition? 
The Reporter. Do you solemnly declare and affirm under the penalty of perjury 
11 that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing 
12 but the truth? 
Mr. de la Torre. Yes. 13 
14 
15 Mr.~ Mr. de la Torre, you can put your right hand down. Thank you. 
My name is I'm a Senior Investigative Counsel on the staff of the 
16 January 6th Select Committee. This will be a staff-led deposition that is led by me. 
17 Members of the select committee may choose to join us. And if they do so, they 
18 can also ask questions as well. But, as we stand here now, no members have joined us. 
19 And I don't expect any will for today. 
20 Otherwise, joining me by Webex, as you've seen, we have an official reporter. 
21 And then there are also staff members on the --on the select committee. 
22 Now we'll follow today the House deposition rules that we've provided to your 
23 counsel previously with the subpoena that came to you. And, under those rules, you are 
24 permitted to have an attorney present, which I see you do. 
25 So, at this time, I'd ask for your attorney, Mr. Becker, to please identify himself for  4 
1 the record and spell his last name for us. 
2 
3 Mr. Becker. Michael David Becker, B-e-c-k-e-r. 
Mr.- Under the House deposition rules, neither committee members nor 
4 staff may discuss the substance of your testimony that you provide today, Mr. de la Torre, 
5 unless the committee approves release. You and Mr. Becker will have an opportunity to 
6 review the transcript at a later date once it's complete. 
7 Before we begin, though, I'd like to describe just a few grounds rules and see if 
8 you or Mr. Becker have any questions. 
9 There is an official reporter, as you've noted and I've discussed, who will be 
10 transcribing the record of this deposition. Please wait until each question is completed 
11 that I ask before you begin your response, and I'll wait for you to complete your answer 
12 before I ask my next question. 
13 The reporter can't record nonverbal responses such as shaking or nodding your 
14 head. So we ask that you please respond with a yes, no, or otherwise a verbal response. 
15 And excuse me in advance if I have to follow up and ask you to do that if you forget. 
16 If you spell something we don't know the spelling to, I might ask you to spell that. 
17 That's simply for the benefit of the record. 
18 And all we ask of you today, as with any witness, is that you provide complete 
19 answers based on your best recollection. If the question is not clear, just say so. I'll do 
20 my best to rephrase it. And if you don't know the answer, simply say so. 
21 Now you may only refuse to answer a question to preserve a privilege recognized 
22 by the select committee. If you refuse to answer a question based on a privilege, staff, 
23 that is, myself, may seek a ruling from the chairman of the select committee on the 
24 objection or proceed with the deposition and, otherwise, keep asking questions and seek 
25 a ruling from the chairman at a later date.  5 
1 If the chairman overrules your objection either today or at a later date, you are 
2 required to answer the question or questions. 
3 I also want to remind you, as we do all witnesses, that it is unlawful to deliberately 
4 provide false information to Congress. And, since this deposition is under oath, 
5 providing false information could result in criminal penalties to include for perjury and/or 
6 providing false statements. 
7 Do you understand all of the grounds rules that I've just discussed? 
Mr. de la Torre. Yes. 8 
9 Mr.- Excuse me for a moment. 
10 Now, Mr. de la Torre, earlier this week, Mr. Becker wrote me to inform the select 
11 committee that you are declining to produce any documents or answer any questions 
12 pursuant to the Fifth Amendment. 
13 Is that correct as a general matter? 
14 Mr. de la Torre. Yes. 
15 Mr.- Be that as it may, we're going to proceed today with questions 
16 relevant to the select committee's investigate with the hope that you will answer. 
17 If you have a privilege assertion, such as the Fifth, please assert it for the record in 
18 response to each question as appropriate. 
19 I'll say at the outset that the Fifth Amendment provides a witness the ability to 
20 refuse to answer a question against himself or herself if they have a reasonable belief 
21 that a truthful answer would tend to incriminate them, not simply because you would 
22 prefer not to answer the question. 
23 Do you understand that? 
24 
25 Mr. de la Torre. Yes.

17 Mr. de la Torre, is it your intention to assert your Fifth Amendment privilege to 
18 any additional questions that I would ask you? 
19 
20 Mr. de la Torre. I assert my Fifth Amendment right. 
Mr.- Under these circumstances, we will not close the record on the 
21 deposition. 
22 As I explained at the outset, when a witness such as yourself refuses to answer a 
23 question based on the assertion of the privilege, as you've done today, it is the 
24 prerogative of the select committee to proceed with the questioning and seek a ruling 
25 from the chairman on the privilege assertions at a later date.  18 
1 So, at this time, we'll hold the deposition in recess, Mr. de la Torre, subject to the 
2 call of the chairman, in order to potentially seek a ruling on your privilege assertions. 
3 Of course, we will provide you appropriate notice if and when the chairman seeks 
4 to resume the deposition after he's ruled on the objection or, rather, the privilege 
5 assertion. 
6 But for now the deposition is in recess, and we'll go off the record. Thank you. 
7 [Whereupon, at 1:27 p.m., the deposition was recessed, subject to the call of the 
8 chair.]  1
