Subject: Re: Draft Complaint 
Thanks Larry, 
Just thinking out loud, but additional guidance on the VP's role might be found int\e Unanimous Resolution of the 
Constitutional Convention, signed by George Washington, on September 17th, 1787. Here's the relevant language. 
"That the Senators should appoint a President of the Senate, for the sole Purpose of receiving, opening and 
counting the Votes for President; and, that after he shall be chosen, the Congress, together with the President, 
should, without delay, proceed to execute this Constitution. By the unanimous Order of the Convention Go. 
Washington-Presidt: W. JACKSON Secretary." 
Snipping in the resolution for ease of convenience. The language highlighted above is in the last paragraph before 
Washington and Jackson sign.

Thus, per the Constitutional Convention, it seems that only the President of the Senate is charged witrreceiving, opening, 
and counting the votes of the electors. Here the ability and power to count based on this guidance seems to be vested in the 
President of the Senate, not Congress. 
Don't know if I've interpreted out of context, or if this would be helpful. But wanted to toss it out there anyway. 
Merry Christmas to all!

Don

Thanks, Kris, 
The best authority I know is the Founders' statement for the first election, described in the draft complaint as follows: "This 
intent is borne out by a unanimous resolution attached to the final Constitution that described the procedures for electing the 
first President (i.e., for a time when there would not already be a Vice President) , stating in relevant part "that the Senators 
should appoint a President of the Senate, for the sole Purpose of receiving, opening and counting the Votes for President." 2 
M. Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, at 666 (1911 ). For all subsequent elections, when there would be a 
Vice President to act as President of the Senate, the Constitution vests the opening and counting in the Vice President." 
I guess there is the example (purportedly non-precedential) of the Hawaii votes in 1960. These historical examples (one by the 
people who wrote the Constitution) are not mere law review articles, but they are not as weighty as reported decisions either.

I wish I could say otherwise, but I think that the wording of the Twelfth Amendment doesn't support 
the asserted exclusive authority of the VP to count (and evaluate the validity of) electoral college 
votes. 
The President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, 
open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted. 
Chapman055338  The sentence switches in the middle from the active voice to the passive voice. If your 
understanding were correct, it would have been worded " ... open all of the certificates AND COUNT 
THE VOTES," remaining in the active voice throughout. The switching to the passive indicates that 
we don't know who it is that counts the votes. 
And aside from that, I also think we would have difficulty convincing a court that the authority to 
count implies exclusive authority to determine which slate of electors is valid in the event of a 
dispute. 
If there is some case law or significant authority (other than a law review article) to the contrary, I 
apologize for not being familiar with it. But if it exists, it needs to be presented, emphasized and 
reiterated.

I agree with this. Except I put the odds at winning in either D.D.C. or CADC closer to zero, and the 
risk of getting a court ruling that Pence has no authority to reject the Biden-certified ballots very 
high. And danger that SCOTUS will decline to take as well. Best we could hope for, then, is a 
dismissal as non-justiciable. 
Let's hold and think this through.

Larry --
My initial view is that this is very well presented, and I apologize for being so blunt, as we all are 
operating under pressure, but strategically although this complaint could be a home run, but more 
likely a disaster, as it could completely tank the January 6 strategy if it resulted in a judicial 
determination in the District in which the Congress will meet that Pence is constrained by 3 U.S.C. 
Section 15. 
Others may have been aware of this complaint before, but I just learned of this one hour ago. 
Speaking for me, please do not file this tonight, and not until it has been thought through 
completely, and we have better answers to the questions below and hopefully reach a consensus. 
The questions I would raise are below. 
Bill 
1. What is the likelihood of a favorable decision by USDC-DC? 
I would say 10 percent max. 
USDC-DC composition is Active judges --11 appointed by Dems (Obama/Clinton); 4 appointed by 
Republicans (Trump) 
2. What is the likelihood of a favorable decision by USCA-DC? 
I would say 10 percent. 
USCA-DC actives judges --7 Dems; 4 Republicans (some not good) 
3. What is the likelihood of a favorable decision by SCOTUS by January 6? 
I would say O percent. 
4. What would Pence do without a declaratory judgment? 
unknown 
5. What would Pence do with a favorable or unfavorable declaratory judgment? 
unknown 
6. What do our House and Senate leaders handling the electoral college challenges think about 
this suit? 
unknown 
7. What does POTUS think? He could be at risk here.
