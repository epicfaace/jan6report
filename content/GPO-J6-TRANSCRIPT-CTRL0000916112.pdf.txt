2 Mr. 3 
Good afternoon. This is a transcribed 
3 interview of Mr. Jason Sullivan conducted by the House Select 
4 Committee to investigate the January 6th attack on the United 
5 States Capitol, pursuant to House Resolution 503. 
6 At this time, I'd ask the witness to please state your full 
7 name and spell your last name for the record, please. 
8 Mr. Sullivan. My full name is Jason Sullivan, and my last 
9 name is spelled S-U-L-L-I-V-A-N. 
10 Mr. Thank you, Mr. Sullivan. 
11 This will be a staff-led interview, and members, of course, 
12 may choose to ask questions. In the room today, you have myself, 
13 
14 I am an investigative counsel. You have Ms. 
who is a professional staff member. We currently 
15 have no members in the deposition --in the interview room. 
16 At this time, could counsel please state their full name 
17 for the record. 
18 
19 
20 Mr. Delicino. Jeremy Delicino, appearing on behalf of Mr. 
Sullivan. 
Mr. Thank you. Mr. Del icino, could you please 
21 spell last name for us? 
22 
23 Mr. Delicino. Sure. It is D-E-L-I-C-I-N-O. 
Mr. Thank you, Mr. Delicino. 
24 There is an official reporter transcribing the record of 
25 this interview. So I'd ask that you please wait until each  4 
1 question is completed before you begin your response, and I will 
2 try to wait until your response before I start my next question. 
3 Our stenographer cannot record nonverbal responses, such as 
4 shaking your head. So it's important that you answer each 
5 question with an audible response. Don't stress this too much. 
6 If I see you shaking your head, I'll note it for the record with 
7 a positive or negative response from the witness. 
8 We ask that you please provide complete answers based upon 
9 the best of your recollection. If the question's not clear, just 
10 please ask me for a clarification. If you don't know answer, 
11 please simply say so. You can also, you know, talk to Mr. 
12 Delicino to ask him a question. Whatever makes you most the 
13 comfortable, we're okay with. 
14 You may refuse to answer a question only to preserve a 
15 privilege recognized by the committee. I understand from your 
16 counsel, Mr. Sullivan, that you may invoke the Fifth Amendment 
17 in response to our questions. Since we are aware of this 
18 obj e ct i on , we ' l l l i k el y ask you r counsel fol low up quest i on s w i th 
19 the goal of understanding the base of your objection. 
20 Ultimately, if you have an objection or privilege assertion, 
21 we'll ask that you assert it for the record so it's noted. 
22 Finally, I want to remind, as we do for all witnesses, it 
23 is unlawful to deliberately provide false information to 
24 Congress, and providing false information could result in 
25 c r i m i n a l pen a l t i e s , i n c l u d i n g u n de r 18 U . S . C . 10 01 .  5 
1 Mr. Sullivan, do you understand that you cannot 
2 deliberately provide false information to Congress? 
3 Mr. Sullivan. Yes, I do. 
4 Mr. Do you have any questions about the 
5 information that I've covered so far? 
Mr. Sullivan. No, sir. 6 
7 Mr. Okay. So, logistically speaking, if you 
8 have any questions or need any breaks to speak to your counsel, 
9 just let us know. We will go on recess, mute everything, go off 
10 camera, so you can speak with Mr. Delicino, and then we will come 
11 back on. And if you don't understand a question, please again, 
12 just can ask me to repeat it. So I'll go into the background 
13 questions then. Can you please just tell us about your 
14 educational background and what you do for a living? 
15 
16 Mr. Sullivan. One question for my counsel, please. 
Mr. Okay. We'll go on mute and recess in 
17 place.

7 the F i ft h Amendment to i t seems l i k e each quest i on i n th i s top i c 
8 about Mr. Stone that we're going to ask you. 
9 The F i ft h Amendment p rote ct s you r r i g ht to refuse to ans we r 
10 questions if the truthful answers would be incriminating, and 
11 the key word there is II if the truthful answers would be 
12 incriminating. 11 Do you understand the Fifth Amendment protects 
13 your right to answer questions if the truth itself would be 
14 i n c rim i n at i n g?

23 A If that's what you're explaining, then I acknowledge 
24 that I heard the way that you explained it. 
25 Q Okay. So, in other words, if you were to invoke the  10

2 to tell the truth and answer these questions, you'd be forced 
3 to testify in a manner that you reasonably believe could be used

Q Yes. 
Okay. And, to be clear, you're asserting the Fifth 
23 Amendment privilege in response to these questions about the

10 A I don't endorse any type of violence. 
11 Q Did you endorse any type of violence December 30th of 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 2020? 
A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
Mr. Delicino. You can answer that question, Jason. 
Mr. Sullivan. What's that? 
Mr. Delicino. You can answer that last question. 
Mr. Sullivan. So please ask the question again. 
18 BY 
19 Q So I asked you if condone a nongovernment militia 
20 preventing the peaceful transfer of power now. And you said you 
21 don't or you don't condone any type violence ever. 
22 I was asking did you condone violence or preventing the 
23 peaceful transfer of power on December 30th of 2020? 
24 A No , I did not . 
25 Q So then what did you mean then by a militia preventing  22 
1 Mr. Biden from entering the White House? How would that happen? 
2 
3 Mr. Delicino. Jason, I'd ask you invoke now. 
Mr. Sullivan. Yeah. I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
4 can we please play clip 10:40 
5 through 11:30? 
6 [Audio played.] 
7 , that's great.

9 Q So the President's speech on January 6th was scheduled 
10 to be --it actually occurred at the Ellipse. 
11 Were you aware that President Trump would then send the 
12 attendees to the Capitol afterwards? Because that segment we 
13 just played was about at the Capitol. So were you aware that 
14 attendees would go to the Capitol? 
15 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
16 Q So then can you explain what you meant by, 
17 quote/unquote, "descend on the Capitol"? What did you mean by 
18 that? 
19 A One moment for my counsel, please. 
20 Mr. Sullivan. Thank you. 
21 No problem. 
22 [Discussion off the record.]

25 Q The question I asked was, can you explain what you meant  23 
1 by, quote/unquote, "descend on the Capitol"? 
2 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
3 Q On the clip we just played, you also make a reference 
4 to Jericho and the walls coming down. Why did you use this 
5 specific reference? 
6 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
7 can we play starting at the 
8 13:05 mark and go to approximately 13:30? 
9 [Audio played.] 
10 
11 
12 Q So, in other parts of the call and even earlier today 
13 you, made a point to mention peaceful and that you don't condone 
14 violence, right? So you said peaceful on parts of the call, and 
15 earlier you said you don't condone violence. 
16 But, in this reference, you describe a patriot as someone 
17 who is willing to die. Why was that even necessary to say? 
18 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
19 Q I guess, by saying a patriot must be willing to die, were 
20 you expecting there to be violence on January 6th? 
21 
22 A 
Q I was not expecting violence. 
So what was the purpose, then, of explaining a patriot 
23 must be willing to die? 
24 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
25 Q D i d t he even t s o r t he v i o l enc e on J a n u a r y 6 t h s u r p r i s e  1 you? 
2 
3 
4 A Yes, they did. 
Q What were you expecting? 
A Peaceful protests. 24 
5 Q So, again, I'll go back, then, if you were expecting a 
6 peaceful protest, then why were we talking about patriots be 
7 willing to die on this phone call? 
8 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
9 Q Is it your intention to assert the Fifth Amendment 
10 privilege to all questions we ask about this conference call and 
11 what you were expecting regarding the violence on January 6th? 
12 A Yes. 
13 Q And, to be clear, you' re asserting your Fifth Amendment 
14 privilege to these questions regarding this December 30th call 
15 in which you were expecting on January 6th because you have a 
16 good-faith belief that the answers to those questions might 
17 expose you to possible criminal prosecution? 
18 A Yes.

20 on J an u a r y 5th and 6th? 
21 A I respectfully plead the Fifth.

6 Washington, D.C.

22 i n J an u a r y 2 0 21?

25 aft e r J an u a r y 6th , so f r om that date u n t i l now?  27 
1 A No.

5 rallies being held at the Capitol on January 6th? 
6 A I don't believe so. 
7 Q Did you speak with any Members of Congress' staff about 
8 the events happening at the Capitol on January 6th? 
9 A I do not believe so. 
10 Q Are you aware of anyone that might have been organizing 
11 that you might have been working with at this time who did speak 
12 with Members of Congress about the events on January 6th? 
13 A I don't believe so. I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
14 Q Okay. Did you speak with anyone from the White House 
15 about the events on January 6th? 
16 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
17 Q Are you aware if Mr. Stone spoke with anybody at the 
18 White House about the events on January 6th? 
19 A Other than what I've seen in public domain around 
20 television or on social media, no. 
21 Q Okay. He never told you about speaking with anyone at

23 A No. 
24 Q Have you ever asked him about it? 
25 A No.  28

3 working relationship at this point? 
4 A We don't talk these days. 
5 Q What about in January of 2021, did you speak then? 
6 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
7 Q Okay. So, when it comes to the events on January 6th 
8 or your communications with Mr. Stone about the events on 
9 January 5th or January 6th, it's your intention to assert your 
10 Fifth Amendment privilege to these questions? 
11 
12 A 
Q Yes.

14 belief that the answers to these questions might expose you to 
15 possible criminal prosecution? 
16 A Yes. 
17 Q Okay. Sothisquestion'sforyou,Mr.Sullivan. And,

8 Hold on one second, there, one second, if you don't mind, 
9 for my counsel. Thank you. 
10 Mr. Thanks. 
11 
12 [Discussion off the record.] 
Mr. Sullivan. Okay. I'm back. Could you please repeat 
13 the question? 
14 Have attorneys representing the former 
15 P res i dent , f o rm e r P res i dent Trump contacted you o r you r counsel 
16 s i n c e J an u a r y 6th? 
17 Mr. Delicino. we weren't talking about Trump yet. 
18 We were talking about 
19 Oh, we were on Mr. Stone. Sorry. I had 
20 moved on. 
21 BY 
22 Q Have attorneys representing Mr. Stone reached out to 
23 you o r M r . Del i c i no o r any of you r o the r at to r n e y s? 
24 A Yes. Stone's attorney reached out to me via email to 
25 send me a cease and des i st to demand that I do not pub l i cl y state  30 
1 that I was Roger Stone's social media strategist, that I must 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 only say that I was a consultant. 
I've had with Stone's attorney. That's the only communication 
And that was from him saying --
7 you? 
8 
9 Q Approximately --
A 
Q --did not respond. 
Approximately when was this cease and desist sent to 
A Within a few months ago. 
Q Okay. Do you know what triggered that? Why that 
10 letter came to you? 
11 A Because I show, you know, that I did work with him at 
12 that time in 2016 as a social media strategist. So I suppose 
13 "consultant" would be a better word. I guess he didn't like the 
14 word "strategist." So I suppose that's what's triggered it. 
15 Q Was it shortly after --I guess, I'm trying to get the 
16 time down. Was it near the time The New York Times published 
17 the article about the conference call December 30th? 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 why? 
23 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A I don't recall if it was that same time or not. 
Okay. Hold on. Let me look at the date of the 
But Stone has publicly thrashed me repeatedly. 
Do you --I know this is speculative, but do you know 
I feel that it's probably because I inadvertently 
24 embarrassed him in 2016 by finding out that he was probably on 
25 the outs with the candidate, 45, or then-candidate  31 
1 President --candidate Trump. I think that embarrassed him, or 
2 the situation I think embarrassed him where he wasn't able to 
3 deliver in some promises that he promised some folks. So I think 
4 I inadvertently embarrassed him. 
5 And then, in addition to that, I provided information during 
6 the Robert Mueller investigations where they asked me about my 
7 involvement with Stone, of course, and Stone was publicly making 
8 statements that he had a, quote/unquote, back channel to Julian 
9 Assange. And I actually was one of the administrators for his 
10 Twitter accounts. So I looked into the private messages, which 
11 I had access to, and discovered that it was everything but the 
12 truth. 
13 Wikileaks had sent him a message that basically: What are 
14 you doing? Stop staying that you have any type of relationship 
15 with us whatsoever. We don't have a relationship, and please 
16 don't go there if you don't want us to publicly correct you. 
17 And he proceeded by arguing with them. But I turned over 
18 those screen shots of those messages, which showed that he 
19 definitely did not have any type of back channel to Wikileaks 
20 or Julian Assange. It was probably very embarrassing for him 
21 as well because he was publicly stating that over and over. I 
22 don't know why, other than to boost his own persona or his own 
23 i n f l u enc e . 
24 Q When you said, in 2016, there were things that, you know, 
25 M r . Stone d i d n ' t de l i v e r on that you mi g ht have em b a r r ass e d h i m  32 
1 about, what were they? 
2 A I don't recall exactly what it was, but it was --I 
3 had well, he had a super PAC, and basically, you know, I had 
4 a couple people that may support the super PAC financially. And 
5 he made some promises that I don't recall exactly what they were, 
6 but I just remember that he wasn't able to deliver, and it was 
7 kind of curious because, you know, he, of course, would tell 
8 everybody that he has Trump on speed dial and he can call him 
9 any time. That's the way he kind of perceived himself, but it 
10 didn't appear to be the case at the time. So I don't recall 
11 exactly what the promise was, but he wasn't able to deliver. 
12 Q Got it. Going back to the cease and desist letter. So 
13 the Allen Feuer New York Times article that we referenced was 
14 published in April of 2022. That's the copy I have. 
15 Is this around the time approximately you might have 
16 received the letter from Mr. Stone's counsel? 
17 A I can try to check, but I would --might have to get back 
18 w i t h you on t h a t . Bu t I c a n c he c k . 
19 Q If that's the case, I can follow up with Mr. Delicino 
20 about this too, and we can just get a proffer email answer from 
21 your attorneys. 
22 Do you remember which attorney reached out to you? 
23 A I can look that up for you. 
24 Q Okay. 
25 A I might be able to do it right now. Can I access my  1 phone? 
Q 
A Let's recess in place. Yeah. Please. 
Okay. Hold on. 2 
3

7 [Recess.] 
Mr. I'm back. 
BY 
Q Carry on. 33 
8 A It seems like I received the cease and desist from Roger 
9 Stone on April 14th, and it was sent from a Grant Smith. 
10 Q Grant Smith. Okay. Thank you. Was it simply about 
11 a --actually, can you turn that over to us? Are you all able 
12 to turn that over to us? 
13 A Yes. Absolutely. 
14 Thank you. Mr. Delicino, I'll email you 
15 right after this, and you can just email it to us. That would 
16 be great. 
17 Mr. Delicino. Jason, just email it to me. I know I have 
18 it somewhere, but. 
19 BY 
20 Q Is that the only time you can think of recently that you 
21 talked to Mr. Stone or representatives of Mr. Stone? 
22 A I believe that's the last time that I've heard from 
23 anything to do with Roger Stone, other than things I might have 
24 seen publicly. I mean, subsequent to that letter --I'm sorry. 
25 Subsequent to receiving that letter, he publicly thrashed me  1 again. 
2 
3 Q 
A 
4 either. 34 
Right. Right. Okay. 
He doesn't like me, and I don't like him very much 
5 Q I guess, knowing him and having worked with him in the 
6 past, right, in 2016, 2017, when you see reports about 
7 Mr. Stone's involvement with Proud Boys or Oath Keepers or 
8 January 6th, what is your reaction to that? 
9 A I'm not happy about a lot of things that took place 
10 there, especially violence on January 6th. I know al ittle bit 
11 about some of these people that were involved as far as my 
12 research that I do. I think it's appalling what took place, you 
13 know. Some of these Proud Boy folks I think were nefarious. I 
14 think some of these Oath Keeper folks were nefarious. 
15 But I can't speak to, you know, what Roger was doing or how 
16 he --what he was thinking or what he was strategizing because 
17 I wasn't working with him. So --but that's my view of the 
18 s i t u a t i on . 
19 Q Did you ever observe Mr. Stone with Proud Boys, though, 
20 when last when you worked with him? 
21 
22 
23 A One second, please. 
[Discussion off the record.] 
Mr. Sullivan. Okay. I'm back. Can you repeat the 
24 question? 
25 Mr. Okay.  35 
1 BY MR. 
2 Q The question was, did you ever observe Mr. Roger Stone 
3 with Proud Boys going back to 2016? 
4 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
5 Q Okay. And, just going back to kind of the litany of 
6 questions about attorneys or representatives reaching out to 
7 you, were you contacted by attorneys representing former 
8 President Trump at all? 
9 A I respectfully plead the Fifth. 
10 Q So, when it comes to, I guess, the former President's 
11 attorneys or representatives, or I guess Mr. Stones' 
12 interactions with Proud Boys or Oath Keepers, is it your 
13 intention to assert the Fifth Amendment privilege to these 
14 questions? 
15 A Yes. 
16 Q And you're asserting this privilege because you have a 
17 good-faith belief that if you were to answer these questions, 
18 it could expose you to possible criminal prosecution? 
19 
20 A 
Q That is my understanding. 
Okay. 
21 Well, that is all the questions I had for today. If we have 
22 anyfollowupquestions, I'll reach out to Mr. Delicino. We might 
23 have followup questions, but unless you have anything else you 
24 want to add, we can end the interview. 
25 A No , I th i n k we ' re good . I sent that let t e r o v e r to M r .  1 Delicino. 
Q Thank you for that. 
A Happy to help in any way that I can. 
Q Okay. Thank you. 
Mr. We'll go off the record at 3:55 p.m. 36
