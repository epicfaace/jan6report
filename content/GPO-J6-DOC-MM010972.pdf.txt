.@FoxNews is a complete outlier here and other media outlets should not follow suit. 
There are still lM+ Election Day votes out there waiting to be counted -we pushed our 
people to vote on Election Day, but now Fox is trying to invalidate their votes. 
We only need 61% of the outstanding votes in Arizona to win. 
The votes are coming from "our counties," and the 61% figure is very doable based on 
what our other Election Day votes are looking like.
