Good Evening--please see below for a series of Parler posts we received through the DC USAO. I don't believe 
there has been any legal process at this point. 
Can you please see if there is anything Guardian on this. No direct threats, and certainly an interest in Pelosi. 
If you can please open a case in RMS to document and advise on the status of any FBI investigation I would appreciate it. 
If this becomes more I can assign a TAS agent to assist. 
Thank you,

This is what I discussed with you in our meeting this afternoon . Jack/Julie- let's see if our team can dig a little further for 
any nexus to MOC's and share with MPD for references on shooting a cop. Jeanita-see what our team can run out on it. 
Thx.

Hope you're well. I assume USCP is well familiar with the various message boards and variety of broad spectrum 
threats/threat comments like this? If it were something more specific as to a particular victim and time/place 
threatened, I would flag with higher priority. But let me know how you have been handling; I have to assume the volume 
of these has been extremely high in recent months.

Good morning Jon, 
I hope that you had a great holiday season and got to spend some quality time with the family. I'm assuming 2021 has 
already started off better considering the WFT is now in the playoffs. Who knew the curse from the team name could be 
lifted so quickly? 
In any event, one of the AUSAs that I supervise found some interesting material on line over the weekend (see below) 
and I had him forward the info to Larry Grasso. I just wanted to get your take on whether this was something I should 
notify District Court of as well and/or another agency (FBI). It might be premature but figured I'd err on the side of 
caution. 
Hope all is well.

Hi Bryan, Larry, 
Over the weekend I came across a Parler (like twitter, but more extreme) account that had some fairly concerning posts. 
After discussing with Chip, my immediate supervisor, he recommended that I send you this information. 
The account is: https://parler .com/profi le/Zoomzoom2/posts 
Here's a small sampling of what caught my eye (these are just posts from last 2 days). All of it is geared towards the 
upcoming Jan. 6 demonstrations.  •

@frenetic I have two teams totally ping nearly 400 vets taking care of shit in GA on the 5th election 
and will be headed DC way when done we are all armed and carrying long rifles. Metro police wants 
to try anything and they will have a mess on their hands, these are some really pissed off vets and 
won't hesitate to shoot a oorru pt oop if they try to interfere.

March in with large groups of armed patriots. Do not let cops deter you. If they confront advise they will be 
fired upon as they no longer have any authority over the people. Be prepared to defend yourselves .

Th is will be a momentous time in our history and you certainly want to be there and pa rt of history. This is 
where we declare 1776 again and begin to take our country back. Bring your modern day pitchforks with you. 
Saving om republic requires decisive action. Don't worry about DC gun laws and police. There will be so many 
carrying Patriots they wi 11 stay away and after the 6th there laws will cease to exist as will their govemment . 
Be there ... i will join you all as soon as I am done cleaning up the mess in GA
