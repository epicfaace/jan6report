3 Mr.. Let's go on the record. 
This is the --ah, yes, I meant to mention that beforehand. The meeting is being 
4 recorded. While there is a --there'll be a recording of this video, the official record will 
5 be the transcript that's prepared by the official reporters, who you'll see are participants 
6 here in the meeting. I'll talk a little bit more about sort of the ground rules as we move 
7 forward. 
8 Mr. Mccolloch. I hate to interrupt but just before I forget, as with most 
9 depositions, we will need to review the transcript draft before it goes final, and I assume 
10 we can get a copy of the recording once it's --once this is concluded? 
11 Mr. - So, no, I'm going to cover that. Let me get to that. Let me just 
12 sort of introduce the deposition and the players, and then I'll talk a little bit about the 
13 ground rules and the transcript, Mike. 
14 This is the deposition of James P. Waldron, conducted by the House Select 3 
15 Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol pursuant to 
16 House Resolution 503. 
17 This deposition is being conducted remotely through the Webex platform. This 
18 will be a staff-led deposition, though members may choose to ask questions as they so 
19 desire. At the present time, no members are present. I will try to keep my eye on the 
20 participant list. The members may come and go, and I'll try to introduce them or note 
21 their presence when they arrive. 
22 My name is-· I'm a senior investigative counsel with the select 
23 committee. Joining us remotely also from the select committee are- who is 
24 the chief investigative counsel; and who are staff for the 
25 select committee; an , who's the chief clerk. Other members of staff may  1 join from time to time. 
2 We'll be holding the deposition under House rules that we previously provided to 
3 Mr. Waldron's counsel. Under those rules, Mr. Waldron, you're permitted to have your 
4 attorneys present. I'll note for the record that your attorneys are present, and in a 
5 moment I'll ask them to identify themselves. But counsel for other persons or other 
6 government agencies may not attend. So, in other words, only the lawyers who are 
7 present today are the select committee counsel and your counsel. 
8 At this time, I'd ask counsel to identify themselves. 
9 
10 
11 Mr. Mccolloch. Mike Mccolloch for the witness. 
Ms. Cook. I'm Karen Cook for the witness. 
Mr~ Before we get started, let me cover a few ground rules. As you 
12 heard me mention earlier, we are recording this, but the official reporter will be 
13 transcribing it, and that will be the official record of this proceeding. You will have an 
14 opportunity to review the transcript after it's prepared. You will not receive a copy of 
15 the video recording. 4 
16 Because the reporter is taking down all the testimony, it's important that you wait 
17 until I finish my question before responding, and I will do my best to wait until you finish 
18 your answer before I ask another question, just to avoid any cross-talk, which makes it 
19 very difficult for the reporters to take down. 
20 The reporters cannot note any nonverbal response, such as shaking or nodding of 
21 your head and so forth, so it's important that you respond to each question with an 
22 audible verbal response. 
23 Any questions on any of that? 
24 
25 The Witness. No. 
Mr.- If you need to take any breaks to discuss anything with your  5 
1 attorneys or just take a break at any time, just let me know and we'll accommodate that 
2 as best we can. And I hope to be as efficient as we can to go through this process today. 
3 You may refuse to answer questions to preserve a privilege if that privilege is 
4 recognized by the select committee. 
5 If you refuse to answer a question based on privilege, staff may either proceed 
6 with the deposition or pause the deposition to seek a ruling from the chair on the 
7 objection at that time. If the chairman overrules the objection, either after it's made or 
8 at the end of the deposition, you'll be required to answer the question. 
9 I want to remind you --and we do this for all witnesses, so I don't want you to 
10 read anything into this admonition --that it's unlawful to deliberately provide false 
11 information to Congress. And because you will be taking an oath to tell the truth at this 
12 deposition, a knowingly false answer could subject you to prosecution for perjury. 
13 Any questions about anything I've said thus far? 
14 
15 
16 The Witness. No. 
Mr.- Madam Reporter, could you swear the witness, please. 
The Reporter. Do you solemnly declare and affirm under the penalty of perjury 
17 that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing 
18 but the truth? 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 The Witness. I do. 
Q 
A 
Q EXAMINATION 
Sir, could you state your name and spell it for the record, please? 
James P. Waldron, J-a-m-e-s, middle initial P, last name W-a-1-d-r-o-n. 
From time to time today, Mr. Waldron, I'm going to show you some exhibits. 
25 And because we're not in the room together, we're going to have ---is going to put  6 
1 them up on the screen and share his screen with us all. 
2 And I think we'll start with exhibit 1. Seems like the right one to start with. Can 
3 you see that okay? 
4 
5 A 
Q Yes. 
Now, I understand this is only a portion of the document, and we'll scroll 
6 through them. And if there's --with any of these exhibits, if you want us to scroll up or 
7 scroll down to see the document better, we can do our best to accommodate that. 
8 And although we're only seeing just the very top of the first page of this 
9 document, do you recognize it? Have you seen this before? 
10 
11 A 
Q It appears to be a subpoena that was received by counsel. 
And you understand that you're appearing here today pursuant to this 
12 subpoena, correct? 
13 
14 A 
Q Correct. 
Have you produced any documents to the committee pursuant to the 
15 subpoena? 
16 
17 A No. 
Q -if we could put up exhibit 2. 
18 And,_ is there a way for us to expand that page so we're seeing --maybe 
19 even in portrait mode? Maybe that's better. Great. Thank you. 
20 So, Mr. Waldron, do you recognize this document? And I'll represent to you this 
21 is the first page of an 18-page document. 
22 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A 
Q Yes. 
And is that a document that was prepared by you and/or your counsel? 
It appears to be a document that was prepared by counsel. 
And submitted in response to the subpoena?  7 
Correct. 1 
2 A 
Q Did you or your counsel search to see whether you had custody or control of 
3 any documents that would be responsive to the subpoena? 
4 A Because the select committee has asserted that the promotion of claims of 
5 election fraud in connection with the 2020 election is among causes of violence on 
6 January 6th at the Capitol, a position that I understand has been adopted, in substance, 
7 by the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice, and because 
8 causation or intended causation is a direct or implied element of inchoate offenses of 
9 various prosecution theories under Federal statutes which have been applied to 
10 defendants who were actual participants in the violence on January 6th at the Capitol, 
11 upon the advice of my counsel, I must respectfully decline to answer that question and 
12 instead assert my rights under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, since an 
13 answer could be exploited by prosecutors under these theories to assert a claim of 
14 liability under such statutes. 
15 Q Are you asserting that the act of producing documents as opposed to the 
16 content of the documents would somehow incriminate you? 
17 A Because the select committee has asserted that the promotion of claims of 
18 election fraud in connection with the 2020 election is among the causes of violence on 
19 January 6th at the Capitol, a position that I understand has been adopted, in substance, 
20 by the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice, and because 
21 causation or intended causation is a direct or implied element of inchoate offenses of 
22 various prosecution theories under Federal statutes which have been applied to 
23 defendants who were actual participants of the violence on January 6th at the Capitol, 
24 upon the advice of my counsel, I must respectfully decline to answer that question and 
25 instead assert my rights under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, since an  8 
1 answer could be exploited by prosecutors under these theories to assert a claim of 
2 liability under such statutes. 
3 Q I'm going to ask you a series of questions, Mr. Waldron, and if your answer is 
4 the same as the one you've given to the first --or my last two questions, it's fine with me 
5 if you'd like to say "same answer" or you can read the answer again or any other answer, 
6 of course, is fine. Any other truthful answer is fine. But if you'd like to say "same 
7 answer" rather than read that over and over again, that would be acceptable.

Q The same reply. 
Did you have any role in drafting the document that's attached to this email? 
Same reply. 
The document proposes that the President use his authority under certain 
17 executive orders to direct the Secretary of Defense to seize voting machines and election 
18 materials throughout the United States. Is that a fair characterization of this document? 
19 A Same reply. 
20 Q The justification that's set forth in this document for that action by the 
21 military is that Dominion Voting Systems and related companies are, quote, "owned or 
22 heavily controlled and influenced by foreign agents, countries, and interests." 
23 Did you write that? 
24 A Same reply. 
25 Q The document refers to issues in Antrim County, Michigan. Were you  11

Are you able to tell whether you've seen this document before? 
Same reply. 
The document is a joint statement from Elections Infrastructure Government 
22 Coordinating Council and the Election Infrastructure Sector Coordinating Executive 
23 Committees. It was issued on November 12th, and I've highlighted a portion of it in the 
24 third paragraph that says: There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost 
25 votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.  1 Were you aware of that determination by the Coordinating Council at the time 
2 that you prepared the document that is part of exhibit 3? 
3 A Same reply. 
4 
5 
6 
7 Q Let's look at exhibit 9. 
Have you seen exhibit 9 before? 
A Same reply. 
Q Exhibit 9 is a statement that was issued on November 16, 2020, signed by 
8 more than 50 election security experts. The title of the document is "Scientists say no 
9 credible evidence of computer fraud in the 2020 election, but policymakers must work 
10 with experts to improve confidence." 
11 If we can scroll down a little bit. 
12 And that's about the fourth or fifth paragraph down. There's a highlighted 12 
13 section that says: To our collective knowledge, no credible evidence has been put forth 
14 that supports a conclusion that the 2020 election outcome in any State has been altered 
15 through technical compromise. 
16 Had you heard by December of 2020 of this statement by election security experts 
17 regarding the absence of evidence of technical compromise of the 2020 election? 
18 A Same reply. 
19 Q Did you consider this statement by the country's foremost experts in that 
20 area when you wrote the document that's referenced in exhibit 3? 
21 
22 A 
Q Same reply.

10 Q Did you use --strike that. 
Did you work with Mr. Ramsland on the document referenced in this email? 
A Same reply. 
Q Did you --actually, I will --and we can scroll down to the second page,_ 
11 Pages 2 through 4 of this document appear to be a document entitled 
12 "Presidential Findings to Seize, Collect, Preserve and Analyze National Security 
13 Information Regarding the 2020 General Election." And it seems to roughly correspond 
14 to the document that was attached to exhibit 3, but there have been some changes 
15 made. 
16 Did you make the changes to this document? 
17 A Same reply. 
18 Q Did you communicate with Mr. Ramsland using encrypted email or 
19 messaging apps during this time period? 
20 
21 
22 A 
Q Same reply. 
Exhibit --if we can go back up to the top of this one again,_ exhibit 4. 
The body of the email says: Final draft finding -includes DHS switch language as 
23 well as foreign interference expansion and warrant issuance language. 
24 Why was the Presidential findings document switched to provide for DHS seizure 
25 of voting machines as opposed to Department of Defense?  1

Mr.- Mr. Waldron, thank you. I don't have any further questions for you. 
Mike, is there anything else that you want to put on the record? 
Mr. Mccolloch. No. Just wanted to reiterate what's in our written response to 
15 the subpoena that all of this is, of course, subject to our other objections that we're not 
16 waiving that are outlined in our written response. 
17 And so, other than that, I believe that's all we have to say. If you're finished with 
18 the questions, then we will adjourn the deposition. 
19 Mr. - Well, we're going to keep the deposition open, subject to the call of 
20 the chair. Your objections are part of the record as exhibit 2. I just want to make sure 
21 you're --

23 Mr. Mccolloch. Yes.
