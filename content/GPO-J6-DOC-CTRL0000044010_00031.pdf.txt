Hi, Ken, Fri, Dec 11, 2020 at 6:00 AM 
Forwarding your question on the lawsuit to our lead attorney, Jesse Binnall, copied on this email, as he is most up to date 
on the situation with our state level case in Nevada.

Thanks for passing this along. wrote: 
No, the COA need not be attached to the electoral votes --the purpose of having the electoral votes sent 
in to Congress is to provide the opportunity to debate the election irregularities in Congress, and to keep 
alive the possibility that the votes could be flipped to Trump and Biden. 
In that connection, can you tell me whether all court challenges Nevada are final? I'm wondering if there will an effort to 
seek Supreme Court review of this decision:

Thank you for this information . 
We were provided with a Certificate of Ascertainment -we had to have it corrected , as the SOS and Governor initially 
listed our alternates instead of our electors. Attached a copy -of course, it shows us with less votes than the Biden 
electors. 
Should we use this COA for anything?

Wonderful to hear! 
Thank you for getting back to me so quickly, despite your hectic schedule. 
I spoke this evening with Mayor Guiliani, who is focused on doing everything possible to ensure that that all the 
Trump-Pence electors vote on Dec. 14. He was glad to hear of your agreement with this strategy. 
As background , I attach my Nov.18 memo explaining the upside of this strategy, and, my Dec. 9 memo on the 
logistics, including the issues raised by state-law provisions regarding the Electoral College. 
You'll note that page 4 of the Dec. 9 memo mentions a concern regarding Nevada law, about the role of the Secretary 
of State. It may well be that the electoral vote needs to proceed without the participation of the Secretary of State, on

the view that these technical aspects of state law are unlikely to matter much in the end. 
Of more practical use, attached are drafts of the Certificate that might be used on Dec. 14, along with a form to use in 
filling vacancies, if any might arise. 
Also attached is a draft memo that could be mailed with the Certificates. 
In terms of logistics, what's key is for the electors to assemble at the appointed time, and each personally sign the six 
(6) duplicate originals, make a copy of one of them (to convert to a PDF to circulate), and enclose each of them in an 
internal envelope, which will be tightly sealed, and labeled outside something like: 
"ELECTORAL VOTES OF THE STATE OF NEVADA 
FOR PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES." 
This is the envelope that will then be opened only by the President of the Senate on January 6. 
Then, the four mailing envelopes would be addressed with the addresses I've listed in the memo. 
Pretty simple! 
Note: the items I've listed on the memo as sent by Registered Mail need to be sent by REGISTERED (not certified) 
mail, which is required by the statute. Certified mail didn't exist in the 1940s when the relevant statute was enacted. 
The Bush team almost messed up on this in 2000! 
Thank you so much for your rapid response. Please don't hesitate to contact me, 24/7, at 617-895-6196.

Mr. DeGraffenried, 
Mayor Giuliani and others with the Trump-Pence campaign (including Justin Clark and Nick Trainer) 
asked me to reach out to you and the other Nevada electors to run point on the plan to have all 
Trump-Pence electors in all six contested States meet and transmit their votes to Congress on 
Monday, Dec. 14. 
I'm one of the lawyers handling the state-court litigation in Wisconsin, the first State which made 
definite plans to have our electors vote on Monday. 
Confidentially, so you can understand how we're messaging it, below is a draft press release by our 
lead lawyer in WI, which would be released only after we file papers in the WI Supreme Court 
(following an expected loss in the lower court), which we expect to do Saturday. 
I'd appreciate if you or someone else on your team could get in touch with me as soon as possible. I 
have two memos explaining the rationale for the electors voting on Monday (though you may already 
have those), and I am preparing drafts of the documents that the electors in Nevada could sign to 
effect their votes, in case having drafts in hand would be of help. 
Call or write anytime, night or day. 
Sincerely, 
Ken Chesebro

Proposed Jim Troupis Statement on Electors' Meeting 
As the legal proceedings arising from the November 3 presidential election continue to work their 
way through the Wisconsin court system, I have advised the Republican Party of Wisconsin to 
convene a separate Republican electors' meeting and have the Trump-Pence electors cast their votes 
at the Wisconsin State Capitol on December 14. 
Of course, there is precedent for such a meeting. Democrat electors pledged to John F. Kennedy 
convened in Hawaii in 1960, at the same time as Republicans, even though the Governor had 
certified Richard Nixon as the winner. In the end, the State's electoral votes were awarded to 
President Kennedy, even though he did not win the state until 11 days after his electors cast their 
votes. 
The legitimacy and good sense of two sets of electors meeting on December 14 to cast competing 
votes for President and Vice President, with the conflict to be later sorted out by the courts and 
Congress, was pointed out by prominent Democrat activists Larry Lessig and Van Jones in an essay 
published last month on CNN.com . 
Given that the results in Wisconsin are still in doubt, with legal arguments that have yet to be 
decided, just as the Democrat electors met in Hawaii in 1960 while awaiting a final resolution of that 
State's vote, so too the Republican electors should meet this year on December 14 as we await a final 
resolution in Wisconsin.
