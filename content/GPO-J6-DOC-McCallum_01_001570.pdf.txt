Basic Script: 
Representative/Senator __ , 
My name is_ calling from Trump campaign headquarters in Washington, DC. 
I know you are very busy, but 
I wanted to personally reach out to you on behalf of the President as you have the 
opportunity to be a crucial part of President Trump's reelection. 
Right now, Mayor Giuliani is presenting experts and witnesses from Georgia to the 
Senate judiciary committee who will show the vote totals are fatally flawed and do not 
accurately represent the will of the voters. 
We wanted to make sure you knew how you could be helpful in ensuring that every 
American is represented and can rest assured that their vote will be counted fairly and 
correctly in this election. 
The United States Constitution provides that the State Legislatures retain sole authority 
to designate the Presidential Electors. 
You have the power to reclaim your authority to send a slate of Electors that will support 
President Trump and Vice President Pence. 
This is a clear path to correct the attempted theft of this election. 
This effort is happening in other states where fraud was rampant including 
Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Arizona. 
State legislators across the country are standing with the President to stop such 
atrocities from happening under their watch. 
This race is far from over, despite what the media says. We need your support. 
When there is a resolution to appoint electors for Trump, can the president count on you 
to join in support?
