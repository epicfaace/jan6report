■ Revised assessment indicates that "Stop the Steal has posted a webpage entitled 
'wildprotest.com' that includes a map of the Capitol grounds indicating they will be 
gathering on the Senate East Front Grassy Area 9 on January 6, 2021. The webpage

the "Stop the Steal" event. 
■ Revised assessment indicates that "there have been several social media posts

• USCP Deputy Chief Gallagher replies to DOD via text that a request for National Guard 
support is not forthcoming at this time after consultation with COP Sund. 
• Revised Special Event Assessment for January 6, 2021 event issues to USCP Executive Team 
and Deputies to both the Senate Sergeant at Arms and House Sergeant at Arms. 
■ Revised assessment indicates that approximately six Members expected to speak at 
demonstration events scheduled on Capitol Grounds. 
■ Revised assessment indicates that "some of militia members who are participating in 
this event and staying in Virginia, plan to march into Washington, DC on January 5th, 
while armed." 
■ Revised assessment indicates "[t]here is also indication that white supremacist groups 
may be attending the protests." 
■ Revised assessment states: 
Due to the tense political environment following the 2020 election, the 
threat of disruptive actions or violence cannot be ruled out. Supporters of 
the current president see January 6, 2021, as the last opportunity to 
overturn the results of the presidential election. This sense of desperation 
and disappointment may lead to more of an incentive to become violent. 
Unlike previous post-election protests, the targets of the pro-Trump 
supporters are not necessarily the counter-protesters as they were 
previously, but rather Congress itself is the target on the 6th. As outlined 
above, there has been a worrisome call for protesters to come to these 
events armed and there is the possibility that protesters may be inclined to 
become violent. Further, unlike the events on November 14, 2020, and 
December 12, 2020, there are several more protests scheduled on January 
6, 2021, and the majority of them will be on Capitol grounds. The two 
protests expected to be the largest of the day-the Women for America 
First protest at the Ellipse and the Stop the Steal protest in Areas 8 and 
9-may draw thousands of participants and both have been promoted by 
President Trump himself. The Stop the Steal protest in particular does not 
have a permit, but several high profile speakers, including Members of 
Congress are expected to speak at the event. This combined with Stop the 
Steal's propensity to attract white supremacists, militia members, and 
Page 4 of24  others who actively promote violence, may lead to a significantly 
dangerous situation for law enforcement and the general public alike.
