2 -· We are here this morning for the deposition of Mr. Roger Stone, 
3 conducted by the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the 
4 United States Capitol, pursuant to House Resolution 503. 
5 This will be a staff-led deposition, though members may choose to ask questions. 
6 I will note for the record we are joined by the vice chair, Ms. Cheney, though we may be 
7 joined by other members during the deposition, and I will endeavor to recognize them 
8 when they appear. 
9 My name is_, and I'm the investigative counsel who has been 3 
10 designated to conduct this deposition by the select committee. With me today are -
11 
12 - who's the chief investigative counsel; 
counsel;_, parliamentarian; and , an investigative 
, professional staff. 
13 Under the deposition rules, neither committee members nor staff may discuss the 
14 substance of the testimony given today unless the committee approves its release. 
15 Mr. Stone, you and your attorney will have an opportunity to review the 
16 transcript. 
17 I would note that, under the House rules, you may have an attorney present, but 
18 counsel for other individuals may not be, and therefore are not, present. And the same 
19 thing goes with counsel for other government agencies. 
20 At this time, I'd ask that your attorney identify himself for the record. 
21 
22 
23 
24 Mr. Smith. Grant Smith, counsel to Roger Stone. 
-· Thank you. 
Let's lay out some of the ground rules for today. 
As you can see, we have an official reporter --two official reporters who will be 
25 transcribing the conversation. The deposition is also being videotaped, but the  4 
1 reporters' transcription is the official record of the proceeding. 
2 I'd ask that you please wait until my questions are finished before you start to give 
3 your answer, and I will do the best to wait until you give your response before I ask 
4 another. The reporter cannot note nonverbal responses such as shaking or nodding a 
5 head, so it's important that you respond to each question and give an audible, verbal 
6 response. 
7 I'd ask that you give complete answers to the best of your recollection. If a 
8 question is unclear, please just ask for clarification. If you do not know the answer, just 
9 say so. 
10 You may refuse to answer a question only to preserve a privilege that is 
11 recognized by the select committee. If you refuse to answer a question based on a 
12 privilege, we may proceed with the deposition or we may seek a ruling from the chairman 
13 on the objection. If the chairman overrules the objection, you're required to answer the 
14 question. 
15 Finally, I would remind you that it is unlawful to deliberately provide false 
16 information to Congress. Doing so could result in criminal penalties, including under 
17 Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001. 
18 In terms of logistics, we can take a break at any point if you need to, whether for 
19 comfort or to speak with your attorney. We'd be happy to accommodate that. 
20 Because this deposition is under oath, I'd ask that you raise your right hand to be 
21 sworn. 
22 The Reporter. Do you solemnly declare and affirm, under penalty of perjury, 
23 that the testimony you're about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but 
24 the truth? 
25 The Witness. I do so swear.  1 
2 
3 Q 5 
EXAMINATION 
Mr. Stone, in front of you and your attorney there are binders with some 
4 documents that we're going to look at today. I'd ask that you first look at what's behind 
5 tab No. 1. It's marked as exhibit 1. 
6 This is a copy of the subpoena issued by the select committee on November 22nd, 
7 2021. The exhibit itself contains the subpoena, a cover letter from the chairman, a 
8 document schedule providing production instructions, and a copy of the House rules and 
9 regulations regarding the conduct of the deposition. 
10 First, can you please confirm that you are the Roger Stone named in this 
11 subpoena? 
12 
13 A 
Q 
14 subpoena? 
15 A 
16 duty. 
17 Q My name is Roger Stone, and I believe that is correct. 
And you understand that you're appearing here today pursuant to this 
I'm here in fulfillment of the subpoena as required by law and to do my civic 
Thank you. 
18 The subpoena also required production of documents that were described in the 
19 schedule attached to the subpoena. Do you understand the documents were required 
20 to be produced? 
21 A I do understand that. 
22 Q Your counsel delivered a letter to the select committee on or about 
23 December 6th, 2021, that you were declining to produce any documents or answer any 
24 questions pursuant to the Fifth Amendment. 
25 The chairman responded to your counsel on December 9th, 2021, noting that a  6 
1 blanket assertion of the Fifth Amendment was insufficient and, to that point, the 
2 select committee is not aware of any basis for you to fail to produce any documents that 
3 would be called for by the subpoena. 
4 The chairman's letter also noted that you would need to sit for the deposition and 
5 assert objections on a question-by-question basis. 
6 I say all this to let you know that my goal for today is to ask questions that are 
7 relevant to the select committee's investigation with the hope that you will answer. If 
8 you have an objection or a privilege assertion, we'll ask that you assert it for the record. 
9 I will seek to clarify the basis for the objection to see what the contours of it are. 
10 I understand from your counsel that you do intend to assert the Fifth Amendment 
11 to each and every question I ask. Be that as it may, I will say that our goal is simply to 
12 understand the basis for your objection and fairly evaluate it. And, ultimately, the more 
13 detail that you can provide as the basis for the Fifth Amendment objection, the easier it 
14 will be for the select committee to understand and consider it. 
15 
16 
17 
18 -· I'd note for the record that Mrs. Luria has joined us. 
Q 
A BY-: 
Mr. Stone, where do you reside? 
On advice of counsel, I will be availing myself of my Fifth Amendment rights 
19 in all of the questions today, including that one. 
20 
21 Q 
A How old are you? 
On the basis of the advice of counsel, I will yet again assert my Fifth 
22 Amendment rights to respectfully decline to answer your question. 
23 Q Mr. Stone, I understand that you'll be asserting your Fifth Amendment right 
24 to each question that we ask today. 
25 I will note that your position from the public record has been and I think continues  7 
1 to be that you have done nothing wrong with respect to January 6th. In fact, we note 
2 that yesterday on your Telegram account you wrote that you would plead the Fifth not 
3 because you had done anything wrong but, because of past experience, your concern 
4 about fabricating perjury charges based on statements made in the deposition today. 
5 Do you understand that the Fifth Amendment protects your right to refuse to 
6 answer questions if the truth itself would be incriminating? 
7 A On advice of counsel, I will yet again invoke my right to decline to answer 
8 your question respectfully on the basis of the Fifth Amendment. 
9 Q I will just say that all we want is the truth, which, I believe by your own 
10 assertion in the public record, you have stated is not itself incriminating. 
11 And so, again, I would ask you: Is your position that, by telling the truth today, 
12 you believe you are being made a witness against yourself for prior conduct that you 
13 believe you could be prosecuted for? 
14 A On advice of counsel, I will be yet again invoking my Fifth Amendment right 
15 pursuant to the U.S. Constitution. 
16 Q And you understand that it is not a valid basis to assert the Fifth Amendment 
17 if you do not believe that the truth itself could lead to prosecution? 
18 A Once again, I will assert my Fifth Amendment right to respectfully decline to 
19 answer your question. 
20 
21 Q We will note for the record your position on these. 
The documents that were called for --excuse me. Exhibit 1 called for the 
22 production of documents. 
23 Did you search for or locate any documents called for by the subpoena? 
24 A Once again, on the advice of counsel, I respectfully decline to answer your 
25 question on the basis of my Fifth Amendment rights.  8 
1 Q Well, we would ask you whether it's the case that you are taking the position 
2 that the act of searching for or identifying any documents responsive to the subpoena 
3 would implicate the Fifth Amendment. Same thing with whether a privilege log would 
4 implicate your Fifth Amendment privilege. 
5 A Once again, I respectfully decline to answer your question on the basis of my 
6 Fifth Amendment constitutional protections. 
7 
8 
9 
10 - I'd note for the record that Mr. Raskin has joined us. 
Thank you for being here, Mr. Raskin. 
BY-: 
Q If you would flip to tab 2 --
11 Mr. Smith. - before your next question, is it possible, so we can 
12 shorten the statement, that Mr. Stone just says "the Fifth" or something shorter so we 
13 move this along --
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 -· Certainly. 
Mr. Smith. --just in the interest of time? 
- Certainly. That's fine. Thank you. 
Mr. Smith. Okay. 
- Moving forward, we'll understand that if you say "Fifth" or "Fifth 
19 Amendment" or something thereto, that it will capture the statement that you have 
20 responded with. 
21 
22 The Witness. I'm sorry. Could you repeat the tab that you want me to look at? 
- Tab2. 
23 Before I proceed to ask questions about the exhibits we have, I'll stop to see if any 
24 of the members have questions. 
25 Ms. Cheney. Thank you. I would like to ask a question.  Mr. Stone, do you believe the violence on January 6th was justified? 1 
2 The Witness. On the advice of counsel, I respectfully decline to answer your 
3 question on the basis of the Fifth Amendment. 
4 Ms. Cheney. Have you ever spoken with President Trump on his private cell 
5 phone? 9 
6 The Witness. On the basis of the Fifth Amendment, I will once again avail myself 
7 of my constitutional right to decline respectfully to answer your question. 
8 Ms. Cheney. Did you speak to President Trump on his private cell phone on 
9 either January 5th or January 6th? 
10 The Witness. Once again, on advice of counsel, I will assert my Fifth Amendment 
11 right to respectfully decline to answer your question. 
12 Ms. Cheney. And, Mr. Stone, did you have any role in planning for the violence 
13 on January 6th? 
14 The Witness. Once again, I will assert my Fifth Amendment right to decline to 
15 answer your question. 
16 
17 
18 
19 Ms. Cheney. Thank you. 
-· Are there any other questions? 
BY 
Q Okay. Hearing none, Mr. Stone, behind exhibit 2 are photographs 
20 appearing to show you at the President's residence at Mar-a-Lago in Florida on or about 
21 December 27th. 
22 I will tell you that, with respect to this photo and events related to it, the 
23 select committee would like to ask you about this trip, whether you spoke directly with 
24 President Trump --
25 A I --I'm sorry.  10 
1 Q --with whom else you may have spoken, whether those conversations were 
2 about the November 2020 Presidential election result, conversations that you had 
3 regarding strategies that the administration or his campaign may be deploying going 
4 forward at this point, and, in particular, whether President Trump or his advisors 
5 explained to you what they expected to happen on January 6th, 2021. 
6 Is it your intention to assert your Fifth Amendment privilege to all questions that 
7 we would ask about your communications with President Trump or his advisors about 
8 their actions or expectations regarding the outcome of the 2020 election? 
9 A With all due respect to the committee, I will yet again invoke my Fifth 
10 Amendment right and decline to answer your question. 
11 
12 
13 Q If you'd take a look behind tab 3 --
Mr. Smith. May I just say something? 
Mr. Stone is here to answer each and every question that you may have. You 
14 may not appreciate the answer, but he's here to give a response to each and every 
15 question. So, if you have more questions, I don't want it to be deemed that he's giving a 
16 blanket answer to a series of questions. He's here to answer each and every question. 
17 So, if you have more questions, ask them. We'll stay as long as possible. But I 
18 don't want it to be seen as him giving a blanket answer to, you know, all questions you 
19 may have. 
20 
21 
22 -· Thank you. We appreciate that clarification. 
BY-: 
Q Behind tab 3, Mr. Stone, is a screenshot from a website that is titled 
23 "Support the Stop the Steal Security Project." And it has a video that shows you and, in 
24 the top left corner, a logo with a ballot box with the words "Stop the Steal." 
25 Are you familiar with the phrase "Stop the Steal"?  1 A On advice of counsel, I will avail myself of my Fifth Amendment rights and 
2 respectfully decline to answer your question. 
3 Q Are you aware that that phrase was taken on and used by an individual 
4 named Ali Alexander in response to the 2020 Presidential election? 
5 
6 
7 A 
Q 
A Vet again, I assert my Fifth Amendment right. 
Do you know Mr. Alexander? 
Vet again, I respectfully decline to answer your question on the basis of my 
8 Fifth Amendment constitutional protections. 11 
9 Q During the 2020 Presidential election, did Ali Alexander talk to you regarding 
10 his use of the phrase "Stop the Steal"? 
11 A With all due respect, I once again invoke my Fifth Amendment right to 
12 decline to answer your question. 
13 Q Well, the select committee would like to ask you about your conversations 
14 with Mr. Alexander regarding his and your use of the phrase "Stop the Steal" and, in 
15 particular, your interactions and conversations with him following the 2020 Presidential 
16 election, including whether you gave assistance to him or other individuals in regard to 
17 the "Stop the Steal" campaign. 
18 Is it your intention to assert the Fifth Amendment privilege to all questions that 
19 we would ask about those communications or others regarding the so-called "Stop the 
20 Steal" movement and Mr. Alexander? 
21 A With all due respect, I yet again assert my Fifth Amendment right to decline 
22 to answer your question. 
23 Q And, to be clear, are you asserting that Fifth Amendment privilege in 
24 response to those questions because you have a good-faith belief that the answers could 
25 expose you to potential criminal prosecution?  12 
1 A Once again, I will invoke my Fifth Amendment right to respectfully answer 
2 your question. 
3 Q Exhibit 3A is the video that was found on this website. And if we could play 
4 that, it's going to be on the screen up here. 
5 [Video shown.] 
6 BY 
7 
8 Q 
A Mr. Stone, that's you in the video, correct? 
On the basis of the Fifth Amendment, I will decline respectfully to answer 
9 your question. 
10 Q Well, in this video, you encourage viewers to visit a website, 
11 stopthesteal.org, to make donations to, quote, "help us pay for the staging, the 
12 transportation, and, most importantly, the security of our peaceful protesters," end 
13 quote, for a January 6th "Stop the Steal" rally. 
14 Did anyone make donations to the project? 
15 A 
16 question? 
17 
18 Q 
A On the basis of the Fifth Amendment, I respectfully decline to answer your 
Who had control over the donations that were made? 
Once again, on the advice of counsel, I will avail myself of my Fifth 
19 Amendment constitutional protection and therefore respectfully decline to answer your 
20 question. 
21 
22 Q 
A Did you hire professional security for January 6th? 
Once again, counsel, I will assert my Fifth Amendment right and decline to 
23 answer your question. 
24 Q Mr. Stone, the select committee would like to ask you questions about your 
25 fundraising efforts for January 6th events, including who had control over the money;  13 
1 how much money was raised; how, if at all, it was spent; and whether it actually, in fact, 
2 went to staging, transportation, and security. 
3 Is it your intention to assert the Fifth Amendment privilege to all of those 
4 questions because your honest answers might expose you to possible criminal 
5 prosecution? 
6 A On the advice of counsel, I will avail myself of my Fifth Amendment 
7 constitutional protections and once again decline to answer your question. 
8 -· I'll pause to see if any members have followup questions based on 
9 what we've covered. 
10 Mr. Raskin? 
11 Mr. Raskin. Mr. Stone, would you answer a question that did not expose you to 
12 potential self-incrimination? 
13 The Witness. On the basis of the advice of my counsel, I'm not going to respond 
14 to that question based on my Fifth Amendment rights. 
15 Mr. Raskin. I yield back. Thank you. 
16 
17 
18 -· Thank you, Mr. Raskin. 
BY-:

19 are a series of screenshots from a chat on a messaging application called Signal. The 
20 title at the top is "Jan 5/6 DC OK security/VIP Chat." And the date says January 1, 2021. 
21

A On the basis of my Fifth Amendment constitutional protections, I will 
23 respectfully decline to answer your question.

7 Roger Stone." 
8 Were you added to this Telegram group --or, excuse me, Signal chat? 
9 A On the basis of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, I will once 
10 again respectfully decline to answer your question. 
11 
12 Q 
A Do you know an individual named Stewart Rhodes? 
Once again, as I said earlier, I will assert my Fifth Amendment right and 
13 decline to answer your question. 
14 Q Well, on the second page of this exhibit --
15 ~ And I'd note for the record that Mr. Schiff has joined us. 
16 BY-: 
17 Q On the second page, under the username "Stewart," the text says, "This 
18 group is for all event organizers and VIP speakers who need Oath Keepers PSD or event 
19 security on Jan 5/6, so they can talk to me and my top OK team leaders all in one place." 
20 On the following page, page 3, Stewart again writes, "So far we are planning on 
21 providing PSD teams for Ali Alexander and Roger Stone." 
22 Mr. Stone, were you provided a personal security detail by an individual named 
23 Stewart in Washington, D.C., on January 5th or 6th? 
24 A Once again, on the advice of counsel, I respectfully decline to answer your 
25 question on the basis of my Fifth Amendment constitutional right protections. 14  1 
2 Q Are you familiar with a group called the Oath Keepers? 
A Once again, counsel, with no disrespect, I would decline to answer your 
3 question on the basis of my Fifth Amendment rights. 
4 Q If you'd flip to the fourth page of this exhibit, the user Stewart, at the 
5 bottom --
6 
7 
8 A One second. 
Okay. Thank you. 
Q At the bottom of the fourth page, Stewart indicates that he has designated 
9 certain individuals who will be involved in, quote, "leadership/coordination," unquote, 
10 including, quote, "Kelly Meggs from FL (who ran the PSDs for Roger Stone)," end quote. 
11 Do you know a Kelly Meggs from Florida, Mr. Stone? 
12 A On the basis of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, I respectfully 
13 decline to answer your question. 
Q And did Mr. Meggs provide security detail for you before January 2021? 15 
14 
15 A Once again, on the basis of my Fifth Amendment constitutional protections 
16 and rights, I respectfully decline to answer your question. 
17 Q On the fifth page, the last page, of exhibit 4, in the center, an individual with 
18 the username "Roger Stone" posts a graphic with your photograph on it appearing to 
19 advertise a MAGA Freedom Rally D.C. at the United States Capitol on January 6th with 
20 Roger Stone as a keynote speaker at 3:45 p.m. 
21 The caption beneath the graphic says, "I am very proud to be talking about health 
22 Freedom and the fight to save America at the MAGA Freedom Rally Jan 6." 
23 Mr. Stone, is that your message in this Signal chat? 
24 A Once again, I respectfully decline to answer your question on the basis of the 
25 constitutions as afforded by the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.  16 
1 Q Mr. Stone, as I think you are aware, it's been publicly reported that you were 
2 interacting with members of the Oath Keepers on January 5th and 6th in Washington, 
3 D.C., and previously had interacted with members of a group called the Proud Boys on 
4 trips to D.C., at least in December 2020. 
5 We would like to ask you about those interactions, as well as other interactions 
6 you may have had with additional groups purporting to provide personal or private 
7 security details, such as the Three Percenters. 
8 Is it your intention to assert your Fifth Amendment privilege to all the questions 
9 we would ask you about your use of personal security details or interactions with 
10 members of these groups under the Fifth Amendment? 
11 A Yes, counsel, it is my intention, on the advice of my counsel, to assert my 
12 Fifth Amendment rights in response to any such questions, including that one. 
13 Q I'd like to ask you to look at exhibit 5. This is a printout of a post from what 
14 is your personal website, stonecoldtruth.com. The title of this post is "Guilt By 
15 Association," and it indicates "by Roger Stone." 
16 Stonecoldtruth.com is your website, is it not? 
17 A I decline to answer your questions on the basis of my Fifth Amendment 
18 constitutional protections with all due respect. 
19 Q At the bottom of the second page of exhibit 5, if you count up, the third 
20 paragraph from the bottom, in the middle of that paragraph, you wrote, "The 
21 Oathkeepers came forward to voluntarily provide free security for me as they graciously 
22 had done at three previous rallies in Miami and Tampa." 
23 Is that true? 
24 A I decline to respond to your question once again on the basis of my Fifth 
25 Amendment right to do so under the U.S. Constitution.  17 
1 Q Mr. Stone, assuming that you wrote this blog post and that the words 
2 contained in it are the truth, is it your position that, by writing this blog post, you exposed 
3 yourself to potential criminal prosecution? 
4 A I respond to answer your question once again on the basis of my Fifth 
5 Amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution. 
6 
7 -· I'll pause to see if any members have followup questions on that line. 
Mr. Raskin. I'd like to ask Mr. Stone whether you believe that coups are allowed 
8 in our constitutional system. 
9 The Witness. I most definitely decline to respond to your question based on my 
10 Fifth Amendment constitutional protections with all due respect. Therefore, I will not 
11 answer the question on the basis of the Fifth Amendment. 
12 Mr. Raskin. Do you believe violent insurrections are allowed in our 
13 constitutional system? 
14 The Witness. I respectfully decline to answer your question on the basis of my 
15 Fifth Amendment rights. 
16 Mr. Raskin. Do you believe fascist street violence is allowed in our constitutional 
17 system? 
18 The Witness. I respectfully decline to answer your questions based on my Fifth 
19 Amendment rights. 
20

3 Constitution not to answer your question. 
4 Q Did Caroline Wren arrange for you to travel to Washington, D.C., for the 
5 events on January 5th and 6th?

25 Bluebonnet Consulting, which is Caroline Wren's consulting company, and it lists as its  19 
1 passengers, among others, Roger Stone and Kristen Davis. The itinerary reflects a 
2 January 5th, 2021, flight from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to Washington Dulles 
3 International Airport. 
4 Is this the flight that you took to Washington, D.C., on that date? 
5 A With no disrespect, counsel, I decline to answer your question on the basis 
6 of my Fifth Amendment constitutional rights. 
7 Q If you look at exhibit 8 behind tab 8, this is a record from the Willard 
8 Intercontinental hotel in Washington, D.C., reflecting a stay between January 5th, 2021, 
9 and January 7th, 2021, for a Mr. Roger Stone. 
10 Was this the time period that you stayed at the Willard hotel, Mr. Stone? 
11 A I'm going to yet again assert my constitutional right under the Fifth 
12 Amendment and decline to answer your question. 
13 Q The company listed on this information from the Willard Intercontinental is 
14 Intentional Lite and Wellness. Do you know what that company is? 
15 A I yet again assert my Fifth Amendment right and respectfully decline to 
16 answer your question. 
17 Q Mr. Stone, the select committee, as you can see, has information suggesting 
18 that you were on a private flight from Florida to Washington, D.C., on January 5th and 
19 stayed at the Willard hotel. 
20 We'd like to ask you about the accommodations that were made, including who 
21 organized and arranged these flights and hotel room and who paid for it, and what the 
22 purpose of this trip to Washington was. 
23 Is it your intention to assert your Fifth Amendment privilege against answering all 
24 the questions that we would ask you regarding these accommodations in January of 
25 2021?  20 
1 A I respectfully decline to comment or respond to your questions based on my 
2 Fifth Amendment constitutional protections. 
3 Q Is your refusal to answer those questions based on a good-faith belief that 
4 the answers could potentially expose you to criminal prosecution? 
5 A I will respond yet again, counsel, to your request to answer that question 
6 based on my Fifth Amendment constitutional rights. 
7 Q If you look at exhibit 9, exhibit 9 contains a series of images that were found 
8 on open sources, websites, advertising speakers for various events in Washington, D.C., 
9 on January 5th and 6th. 
10 For example, the first page shows an event under the caption "One Nation Under 
11 God," sponsored by Virginia Women for Trump, and, as you can see, the first speaker 
12 listed is Roger Stone. According to this flyer, the event was to be held on Tuesday, 
13 January 5th, from 2:00 to 5:00 p.m. 
14 Were you slated to speak at this event? 
15 A Once again, I will assert my Fifth Amendment right to respectfully decline to 
16 answer your question. 
17 Q The second page of exhibit 9 is another image that identifies Roger Stone 
18 and has your image. And it says this is for the "Rally to Save America," "Presented By: 
19 Eighty Percent Coalition." And it identifies Freedom Plaza as the location, on Tuesday, 
20 January 5th, from 7:00 to 8:00 p.m. 
21 Were you slated to speak at this event? 
22 A I decline to answer your question both on the advice of counsel and under 
23 my Fifth Amendment constitutional right to do so. 
24 Q The third page of exhibit 9 is yet another image, and, this one, you can see 
25 your face in the center of the page. And it's for an event called "Freedom Rally." This  21 
1 is now on Wednesday, January 6th, from 12 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. at the United States 
2 Capitol. 
3 Were you asked to speak at this event? 
4 A I again assert my Fifth Amendment right to respectfully decline to answer 
5 your question. 
6 Q Finally, the next three pages of exhibit 9 reflect screenshots from the 
7 archived website wildprotest.com. 
8 As you can see, the wildprotest.com website indicates an event, among others, 
9 from 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. on January 6th at the Capitol Building. And the final page of 
10 the exhibit identifies, among others, Ali Alexander, Roger Stone, Representative Paul 
11 Gosar, Representative-elect Marjorie Greene, Representative-elect Lauren Boebert, and 
12 others as invited speakers and featured guests. 
13 Were you invited to speak at the Capitol Building on January 6th at 1:00 p.m.? 
14 A I will respectfully decline to answer your question yet again on the basis of 
15 my Fifth Amendment constitutional rights and protections. 
16 Q Behind exhibit 10, I can tell you this is an archived blog post from the 
17 website thegatewaypundit.com. The title is "Roger Stone Associate,: 'We had no part 
18 in Jan 6th."' And it indicates, a guest post written by "Roger Stone Associate Kristen 
19 Davis." 
20 Is Ms. Davis your associate? 
21 A I decline to answer your question on the advice of counsel and my Fifth 
22 Amendment constitutional right to do so. 
23 Q At the bottom of the second page of exhibit 10, Ms. Davis writes: 
24 "So what exactly happened on January 6th in Washington D.C. as it pertains to 
25 Roger Stone. The facts are simple and crystal clear. I booked Roger to speak at the  22 
1 Rally to Save America the night prior and was led to believe by Women for America First 
2 that he was supposed to speak the following afternoon on January 6th, at a rally they 
3 organized which featured President Donald J. Trump. After a completely peaceful rally 
4 on January 5th, which attracted thousands of brave American patriots, we woke up the 
5 next morning expecting to attend the rally at the Ellipse." 
6 Is it true that you were expecting or had been invited to speak at the rally where 
7 the President would speak on January 6th, 2021? 
8 A With no disrespect, I will yet again assert my Fifth Amendment right to 
9 decline to answer your question. 
10 Q Well, Mr. Stone, as you can see, we've identified multiple events where you 
11 were advertised as a speaker on January 5th and 6th by different groups in Washington, 
12 D.C. 
13 The select committee would like to ask you questions about how you were 
14 recruited to those events, what guidance you may have been given about the purpose of 
15 the events, whether you were given any guidance or participated in coordination about 
16 the messaging for those events, and then ultimately why you may or may not have 
17 spoken at those events on January 5th and 6th. 
18 Is it your intention to assert your Fifth Amendment privilege to all the questions 
19 that we would ask you regarding your speaking engagements on January 5th and 6th, 
20 2021? 
21 A I believe I understand your question. I will yet again assert my Fifth 
22 Amendment right and respectfully decline to answer such questions. 
23 
24 Q Mr. Stone --
Mr. Smith. And, again, I'm just going to reiterate, it's your prerogative not to ask 
25 the list of questions that you have. He's here and will, you know, provide a response to  1 each and every question should you choose to ask them. 
2 
3 
4 -· I understand. 
BY-: 
Q To be clear, Mr. Stone, are you asserting your Fifth Amendment privilege 
5 against answering our questions about your speaking engagements on January 5th and 
6 6th because you believe that your truthful and honest answers could expose you to 
7 potential criminal prosecution? 
8 A I once again invoke my Fifth Amendment right and respectfully decline to 
9 answer that question. 23 
10 
11 
12 
13 -· I'll pause to see if any members have followup questions on that line. 
Mr. Schiff. I do have some questions. It's Adam Schiff. 
Mr. Stone, were you previously convicted of making false statements to Congress? 
The Witness. I respectfully decline to answer that question based on my Fifth 
14 Amendment rights. 
15 Mr. Schiff. Mr. Stone, are you invoking your Fifth Amendment rights because of 
16 a concern over potentially making additional false statements to Congress or for your 
17 involvement in the underlying conduct that led to the insurrection? 
18 The Witness. Based on the advice of my counsel, I will respectfully decline to 
19 answer that question based on my Fifth Amendment rights as guaranteed by the 
20 U.S. Constitution. 
21 
22 Mr. Schiff. I have no further questions. Thank you. 
Mr. Raskin. I'd like to ask Mr. Stone about an article that appeared in The New 
23 Yorker magazine on May 23rd, 2008, called "The Dirty Trickster." 
24 And, in that article, Mr. Stone, you're quoted as saying, "Admit nothing. Deny 
25 everything. Launch counterattack."  1 
2 Is that an accurate quote? 
The Witness. On the basis of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, 
3 which I revere, I will respectfully decline to answer that question. 
4 
5 Mr. Raskin. Did you ever seek any kind of correction for that quotation? 
The Witness. Once again, on the basis of the Fifth Amendment of the 
6 Constitution of the United States, I will respectfully decline to answer that question. 
7

17 Mr. Raskin. Okay. Thank you very much. I yield back. 
The Witness. Thank you.

Q Mr. Stone, later in the post by Ms. Davis, at page 4 --
A Tab 4 or page 4? 
Q Page 4 of exhibit 10. 
Mr. Smith. The previous tab. 
Mr. Stone. Oh. 
Mr. Smith. I think one more. There you go. 
BY-: 
Q I apologize, maybe it's not on page 4. But it's been publicly reported 24 
18 that --I apologize, it is here on page 4. She writes that you and others remained in your 
19 suite at the Willard hotel and watched TV rather than go to the Ellipse rally. 
20 Is that accurate? 
21 A I decline to answer your question on the advice of counsel, once again 
22 asserting my Fifth Amendment constitutional right. 
23 Q If we look behind tab 11 at what's marked exhibit 11, this appears to be a 
24 photograph of you inside the Willard hotel. Is that what this photograph is? 
25 A I decline to answer your question based on my Fifth Amendment  25 
1 constitutional rights. 
2 Q And the photograph shows numerous folks, including an individual who 
3 appears to be holding a video camera. Do you know who that individual is? 
4 A I decline to answer, once again, your question on the basis of my Fifth 
5 Amendment constitutional rights. 
6 Q Behind exhibit 12, tab 12, are a series of text messages between Ali 
7 Alexander and an individual whose name is Roger Stone, indicating both incoming and 
8 outgoing messages on January 6th, 2021. 
9 As you can see, the exhibit reflects that Mr. Alexander received an incoming text 
10 message from Roger Stone at approximately 10:02 on January 6th saying, "As I expected 
11 no speaking spot, no VIP entrance for any of my people." 
12 Were you denied a speaking spot on January 6th, 2021, Mr. Stone? 
13 A On the basis of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, I respectfully 
14 decline to answer your question. 
15 Q How was the information conveyed to you that you wouldn't be speaking on 
16 January 6th, 2021? 
17 A Once again, counsel, with no disrespect, I decline to answer your question 
18 based on my Fifth Amendment constitutional protections. 
19 Q You can see a, few lines later, outgoing message from Ali Alexander to Roger 
20 Stone, January 6th, 2021, at 12:46, quote, "Get your ass to the US Capitol," followed a 
21 minute later by, "We have a stage & the presidents order." 
22 Do you remember seeing these messages from Ali Alexander? 
23 A Once again, counsel, I respectfully decline to answer your questions on the 
24 basis of my Fifth Amendment constitutional rights and protections. 
25 Q Did the President order individuals to go to the U.S. Capitol, as Ali Alexander  1 indicates in the text message? 
2 A Once again, counsel, with no disrespect, I decline to answer your question 
3 on the basis of the Fifth Amendment protections afforded by the U.S. Constitution. 
4 Q If we look at --
5 -· And I'll pause to note that Mr. Aguilar has joined us. 
6 BY-: 
7 Q Exhibit 13 is a video. If we could play exhibit 13, but we can start it at 43 
8 seconds in. 
9 And I'll say for the record that this is a video that was posted to the lnstagram 
10 account , which we understand to be your wife's lnstagram account. 
11 And it was posted January 13th, 2021. 
Let's go ahead and play it. And we can stop it at 1 minute and 20 seconds. 
[Video shown.] 
BY-: 
Mr. Stone, that's you in that video, correct? 26 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 Q 
A I decline to answer your question on the basis of the Fifth Amendment of the 
17 United States Constitution. 
18 Q In the video, you state, quote, "While I was supposed to speak at the Ellipse 
19 and lead a march from the Ellipse to the Capitol or speak at the Capitol, or at least 
20 allegedly was so, I decided I was not interested in doing any of those things," end quote. 
21 Was there, in fact, a proposal for you to lead a march to the U.S. Capitol on 
22 January 6th, 2021? 
23 A Once again, I will decline to answer your question on the basis of my Fifth 
24 Amendment constitutional rights and protections. 
25 Q Who else was supposed to be leading the march with you?  27 
Once again, I will assert the Fifth Amendment rights. 1 
2 A 
Q Now, you say in the video that you were to, quote, "speak at the Capitol, or 
3 at least allegedly was so," end quote. Why do you say "allegedly" in the video? 
4 A Once again, I will decline to respond to your question based on my Fifth 
5 Amendment rights. 
6 Q Do you think someone else was using your name without your knowledge to 
7 put you at the U.S. Capitol on January 6th? 
8 A With no disrespect, I will once again assert my Fifth Amendment rights and 
9 decline to answer your question. 
10 Q And, in the video, you say that you declined to march to the Capitol. Why 
11 did you decline? 
12 A I once again will assert my Fifth Amendment rights to decline to answer your 
13 question. 
14 Q And, later in this video, the portion that immediately follows where we 
15 pause, you describe leaving the Willard hotel to go to the airport on January 6th. 
16 Is it true that you never left the Willard hotel on January 6th except to go to the 
17 airport? 
18 A I decline to answer your question on the basis of my Fifth Amendment 
19 rights. 
20 Q Well, we do have another video that's exhibit 14. This is a clip from your 
21 appearance on the "Tucker Carlson Today" program on December 3rd, 2021, which was 
22 just 2 weeks ago. 
23 During this clip, Mr. Carlson has just asked you whether you think you would have 
24 been arrested had you gone into the Capitol on January 6th. 
25 I'd ask --we'll play this from the beginning and pause it at 41 seconds.  1 
2 
3 [Video shown.] 
BY-: 28 
Q Mr. Stone, you say in this portion of this interview with Tucker Carlson just 2 
4 weeks ago that you got a call at the Willard hotel on January 6th which you understood to 
5 be from the Secret Service, offering to escort you to the Capitol. 
6 Did that really happen? 
7 A I decline to answer your question on the basis of my Fifth Amendment 
8 rights. 
9 Q How would you have known that those individuals were from the Secret 
10 Service? 
11 A I decline to answer your question on the basis of the constitutional 
12 protections afforded by the Fifth Amendment. 
13 
14 Q 
A You also say in the video that you think you were set up. Set up by who? 
I decline to answer your question on the basis of my Fifth Amendment 
15 constitutional rights. 
16 Q Now, as you can see, the select committee would like to ask you about these 
17 plans to march or not to the U.S. Capitol. And it would appear from text messages and 
18 public interviews and postings that you have made that you were willing to speak publicly 
19 about what you understood to be the plans to go to the U.S. Capitol on January 6th and 
20 ultimately your decision not to go to the U.S. Capitol. 
21 Is it your intention to assert the Fifth Amendment privilege to any questions that 
22 we would ask you about your plans or not to march to the U.S. Capitol on January 6th? 
23 A And that is correct. I assert my Fifth Amendment rights not to respond to 
24 that question or any other related question as you indicated. 
25 Q Is it your position that the statements in the video posted to your wife's own  1 lnstagram account, themselves, would expose you to potential criminal prosecution? 
2 A I decline to answer your question on the basis of my Fifth Amendment 
3 constitutional rights. 
4 Q Is it your position that the statements you gave 2 weeks ago to Tucker 
5 Carlson, themselves, implicate potential criminal liability on your part? 
6 A I decline to answer your question on the basis of my Fifth Amendment 
7 constitutional rights. 
8 ~ I'll pause to see if any members have followups on that line of 
9 questions. 
10 BY-: 
11 Q Mr. Stone, have you been interviewed by law enforcement regarding your 
12 knowledge of events in Washington, D.C., on January 5th and 6th, 2021? 
13 A I decline to answer your question on the basis of my Fifth Amendment 
14 constitutional rights. 
15 
16 
17 rights. 
18 Q 
A 
Q Have you been contacted by the FBI regarding January 6th? 
I decline to answer your question on the basis of my Fifth Amendment 
Have you been contacted by any attorneys representing individuals who 
19 have been charged for conduct regarding January 6th? 
20 A I respectfully decline to answer your questions on the basis of my Fifth 
21 Amendment rights. 29 
22 Q Is it your intention to assert your Fifth Amendment privilege to all questions 
23 that we would ask you regarding your contacts by anyone regarding the events of 
24 January 6th, 2021? 
25 A I decline respectfully to answer that question and any related questions as  30 
1 indicated in your question. 
2 -· At this point, I would note for the record that Mr. Stone has asserted 
3 the Fifth Amendment privilege as a basis to refuse to answer all of the select committee's 
4 questions today. Under these circumstance, we will not close the record on the 
5 deposition as the select committee determines the appropriate course of action in order 
6 to move forward. 
7 But, before we go off the record, I'll pause to see if any members wish to offer 
8 anything else today. 
9 Mr. Smith. I have a question. 
10 I mean, this deposition was called for a 1-day deposition. I'm not sure by what 
11 rule you can hold it over or keep it open. So, from our standpoint, I believe this would 
12 be closed. 
13 Mr. Stone appeared for the time that was shown in the deposition. And I don't 
14 know of any rule or --and there was nothing in the deposition. As you know, many 
15 deposition notices do have, you know, "or until completed" or "held over" or something. 
16 But we're not agreeing to hold it open or to keep it open. 
17 We'll note your objection, but, as I explained at the outset, when 
18 there are objections based on privilege, it is the prerogative of the committee to move 
19 forward with questions and later seek a ruling from the chair on those objections. 
20 And so what we will do is we will hold the deposition in recess, subject to the call 
21 of the chair, in order to potentially seek a ruling on that objection. 
22 Of course, we will give appropriate notice to you so you can be present if and 
23 when that will need to occur. 
24 
25 Mr. Smith. Okay. As long as my objections are on the record. 
-· I understand.  31 
1 Well, at this time, the deposition will stand in recess, subject to the call of the 
2 chair, and we'll go off the record. 
3 [Whereupon, at 10:51 a.m., the deposition was recessed, subject to the call of the 
4 chair.]  1
