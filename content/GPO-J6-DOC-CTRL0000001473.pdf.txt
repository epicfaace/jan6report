> on December 28, 2020, Telegram user "GFB" posted a series of messages in the neo-Nazi chat group "MWG" 
calling on attendees of an upcoming pro-Trump protest scheduled for January 6, 2021, in Washington D.C. 
> 
> "we need boots on the ground and voices loud enough to be heard for miles. That's the only way things 
are going to change," began "GFB," a member of the neo-Nazi group Vorherrschaft Division. In chat groups 
for members of the group "GFB" has admitted to feeling that Trump's exit from office is a foregone 
conclusion, and thus that their goal should be to "push for more nationalist policies and attitudes." 
> 
> However, "GFB" went on to say in "MWG" that Trump supporters in D.C. on January 6 should "march into 
the capital building and make them quake in their shoes by our mere presence." 
> 
> "The overclass needs to be shown that the people are not to be trifled with," said "GFB."
