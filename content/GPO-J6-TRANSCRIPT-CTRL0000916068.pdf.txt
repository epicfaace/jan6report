1 Good afternoon, Secretary Mnuchin. This is a transcribed 
2 interview conducted by the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack 
3 on the United States Capitol pursuant to House Resolution 503. 
4 Could you please state your full name and spell your last name for the record? 
5 Secretary Mnuchin. Sure. Steven Terner Mnuchin, M-n-u-c-h-i-n. 
6 My name is and I am the chief 
7 investigative counsel to the select committee. With me is 
8 
9 
10 committee. ----and 
11 I understand you're represented by counsel. also staff of the select 
12 Counsel, if you could also introduce yourselves and spell your last names for us. 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 Mr. Peikin. Steven Peikin, P-e-i-k-i-n, from Sullivan & Cromwell. 
Mr. Willscher. Alex Willscher, W-i-1-1-s-c-h-e-r, from Sullivan & Cromwell. 
Mr. Greene. Miles Greene, G-r-e-e-n-e, from Sullivan & Cromwell. 
Great. Welcome. 
This will be a staff-led interview, although members of the committee may join 
18 and choose to ask questions. Because it is a virtual interview, members, if they join, will 
19 put their camera on and I will do my best, Secretary Mnuchin, to indicate when they are 
20 present and recognize them if they choose to be. I'll announce their presence so you 
21 know who's on and who's not. 
22 There is an official reporter --two official reporters --who will be transcribing the 
23 record of the interview. Please wait until each question is complete before you begin 
24 your response, and we'll try to wait until your response is complete before we ask our 
25 next question.  4 
1 The stenographer cannot record nonverbal responses such as shaking of your 
2 head, so it's important that you answer each question with an audible verbal response. 
3 We ask that you provide complete answers based on your best recollection. If 
4 the question is not clear, please ask for clarification. And if you don't know the answer, 
5 obviously, just say so. 
6 I have to remind you, as we do with all witnesses, that it is unlawful to deliberately 
7 provide false information to Congress. Doing so could be a violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001 or 
8 other statutes. 
9 Any questions about the basic --
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 Secretary Mnuchin. No. All set. 
Okay, great. 
EXAMINATION 
B~ 
Q So let me start, Secretary Mnuchin, by just show you what we'll mark here as 
15 exhibit No. 1, which is a letter dated today from Special Counsel to the President Richard 
16 Sauber to your lawyers, Mr. Peikin and Mr. Willscher. 
17 Have you seen this in advance and had an opportunity to review it? 
18 
19 A 
Q I just saw it when I arrived, and I've reviewed it. Thank you. 
Okay, great. It is a letter, for the record, from the White House counsel 
20 indicating that, in their view, it would not be appropriate to assert executive privilege on 
21 the subjects identified, including events within the White House on or about January 6th, 
22 attempts to use the Department of Justice to advance a false narrative that the 2020 
23 election was tainted by widespread fraud, other efforts to alter election results or 
24 obstruct the transfer of power. 
25 So, again, for the record, that's the position of the current White House counsel.  1 
2 
3 Secretary Mnuchin, you're here voluntarily, correct? 
A 
Q Yes. 
Not pursuant to a subpoena but here, rather, to provide your voluntary 
4 cooperation to the committee. 
5 
6 A 
Q That is correct. 
Which we very much appreciate. 
7 You served as Secretary of Treasury from, my understanding, February of 2017 all 
8 the way through the end of the administration in January 2021. 
9 
10 A 
Q That is correct. 
Okay. At any point after the 2020 election, did you have any discussions 5 
11 with President Trump about the results, the integrity of the vote, or anything having to do 
12 with the election results? 
13 A I had a brief conversation with President Trump shortly after the election, so 
14 not long after, and asked him if he was going to concede the election. He told me he 
15 was going to pursue his legal remedies before he decided to do anything, which I 
16 understood. And that was the extent of our conversation. 
17 Q About approximately when did that conversation take place? 
18 A It was in the first week. 
19 Q I see. 
20 A It may have been a few days, but it was definitely within the first week. 
21 Q I see. Do you know if it was before or after the election had been called or 
22 the networks had indicated? I think that was on Saturday the 7th that they projected 
23 President Biden. 
24 
25 A 
Q My guess is it had been after it had been called, but I don't recall specifically. 
Okay. Was that in person or by telephone?  1 
2 A 
Q I believe it was by telephone. 
All right. Is it the only conversation with him at any time that you had 
3 about the election? 6 
4 A It was the only conversation that I had about the election. There may have 
5 been other times where he said certain things about the election which were consistent 
6 with what he said publicly. 
7 Q I see. Okay. But the only time you recall a direct conversation with him 
8 was that one? 
9 
10 A 
Q That is correct. 
All right. 
11 Did you in any way make an effort to form your own opinion about these 
12 allegations of alleged election fraud? 
13 A You know, unlike the previous campaign, I was not involved in this campaign. 
14 I was really not in a position to understand things. So, you know, I followed the 
15 Attorney General and other things that he was saying. 
16 Q Yeah. The Attorney General on December the 1st made a public 
17 announcement, did not see --the Department of Justice did not see existence of election 
18 fraud sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome in any State. 
19 Did you endorse that or believe that to be --that was accurate? 
20 A I had no expertise in understanding anything different, so I respected his 
21 view and assumed that he was correct. 
22 Q Okay. You mentioned before that that first conversation with President 
23 Trump did involve some discussion of whether he would concede. Is that right? 
24 
25 A 
Q It was a very brief discussion, but yes. 
So no other conversations with him about whether he should concede after  1 that initial? 
2 
3 A 
Q No. 
Okay. Did you have any concerns --we've heard from other colleagues of 
4 yours in the Cabinet that they had concerns about the nature of the advice that the 
5 President was getting after the election. 7 
6 Did you share those concerns, have any reason to believe he was not being served 
7 by other voices outside of the Cabinet? 
8 
9 A 
Q Again, only from what I was hearing secondhand. So yes. 
Tell me more about that. What were you hearing secondhand and what 
10 were your concerns? 
11 A That there were people around him who were not necessarily the staff or 
12 the full-time people who had been part of the team that were making claims of election 
13 fraud. 
14 
15 
16 Q 
A 
Q Did you talk with the President at all about that, about --
1 did not. 
Okay. Did you express those concerns to anyone else, about the quality of 
17 the advice the President was getting? 
18 A I may have expressed that to the chief of staff, Mark Meadows, but beyond 
19 that, no. 
20 Q All right. On the issue of concession, did you ever talk to Mr. Meadows 
21 about whether the President should or shouldn't concede? 
22 
23 A 
Q Not that I can recall. 
Okay. Anyone else besides the President himself, discussions about 
24 whether he should concede? 
25 A Not that I recall, no.  1 
2 
3 Q 
A 
Q Okay. I understand on January 6th you were traveling abroad, correct? 
I was. I was in Israel. 
Okay. When did you first have indication that there was violence at the 8 
4 Capitol, and how did you get that information? 
5 A I came back from dinner, and we turned on the TV and we watched it. That 
6 was the first time I had any indication of it. 
7 Q When you first had the indication of it, did you take any action, make any 
8 inquiries to get more information? 
9 A Again, it was very late at night. Again, I don't recall. We were watching it 
10 live on TV. Obviously, I had concerns about what was going on, but I don't recall making 
11 any calls. 
12 
13 
14 
15 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
16 that point. 
17 Q Okay. Did you speak to anyone at the White House, for example? 
Not that I recall. 
Okay. Not the President, not Mr. Meadows? 
I definitely didn't speak to the President and didn't speak to Mr. Meadows at 
Okay. How about within your own organization, within the Treasury, did 
18 you call back to see if the events were in any way causing concern or affecting the 
19 Treasury Department? 
20 A I was in regular communication with the Treasurer, and it was not impacting 
21 the Treasury at all. We were normally functioning. 
22 Q All right. So did you have any concerns about a security threat to the 
23 facility at Treasury? 
24 A I had the Secret Service with me, and, you know, they would advise me if 
25 there was such a situation, and we did not have any of those concerns.  1 Q All right. How about discussions with anyone at Treasury or elsewhere 
2 about the stability of financial systems or markets, either on or after January 6th, did you 
3 have any of those concerns or discussions? 
4 A I did not have those concerns. The markets were functioning, fully 
5 functioning. There were plenty of other times that I had those concerns while I was in 
6 office and we appropriately dealt with them, but the markets were functioning normally. 
7 Q Understood. Okay. Did you have any conversations with Vice President 
8 Pence that day? 
9 A I had no conversations with him that day. I did have conversations with 
10 him later in the week. 
11 Q Okay. Tell us about that conversation after January 6th and the election 
12 had been certified. Tell us about any conversations you had with Vice President Pence. 
13 
14 events. 
15 
16 A 
Q 
A Again, I had a normal conversation with him just to check in, given the 
Tell us what you said to him and what he said back to you. 
Again, I wanted to make sure that he was okay. And, again, we just talked 
17 about the normal functioning of government. 
18 Q Did you express thanks or admiration or compliment him on the steps that 
19 he took on the 6th? 
20 A I appreciated what he did, but I don't --I don't specifically remember that 
21 conversation. 9 
22 Q Okay. Did he say anything, share anything with you about his experience or 
23 anything that had happened? 
24 A He did not go into the details. I obviously had read a bunch of it in the 
25 press.  1 Q Okay. We'll talk a little bit more here about efforts, discussions about 
2 things to do and some of the transition. 
3 Anything at all, though, with Vice President Pence about the events of the 6th? 
4 Nothing else? 
5 
6 A 
Q No. 
How about military leaders or Members of Congress, did you ever speak to 
7 any of them about the events of the 6th? 
8 A I don't recall speaking to Members of Congress, I think only because in one 
9 of the questions that you sent me you referenced that General Milley referenced a 
10 conversation that he and myself and Secretary Pompeo had had. 10 
11 Q Yes. Yeah. Let's go to that. Do you recall a conversation where General 
12 Milley was present where you were talking to Secretary Pompeo? 
13 A I believe --I believe it must have been a meeting, a normal meeting in the 
14 Situation Room. It was probably a Principals Committee meeting, because I don't recall 
15 having seen him other than that period of time. And we may have had a casual 
16 conversation on the sidelines of that. 
17 Q Okay. And do you recall anything specific about that casual conversation? 
18 A Again, I recall that, you know, we felt there was the normal functioning of 
19 government. And, again, putting aside the election issues, we all had a lot to do and 
20 government was functioning. 
21 Q Yeah. Let me just read you what General Milley testified when he was here 
22 before the select committee. 
23 He was asked, "Do you remember on the 6th or days thereafter any discussion of 
24 the potential invocation of the 25th Amendment?" 
25 He said, "Yes. So I'm not a member of the Cabinet and I have no role whatsoever  11 
1 in the 25th Amendment, but there was at least one or two occasions when other 
2 members of the Cabinet mentioned it very brief, like 10 seconds, 15 seconds. And then 
3 they looked and they saw that I was standing there and, knowing that I'm not a member 
4 of the Cabinet, they shut up." 
5 
6 
7 
8 Question: "Who were they?" 
Answer: "Steve Mnuchin, Pompeo. I think that's it, those two." 
"What do you remember them saying?" 
General Milley said, "It was just a discussion. They were talking about something 
9 and then the term '25th Amendment' comes up. I'm there. I'm like from here to here 
10 away." And he literally was about as far as I am from you. "And then they look, they 
11 see me, they know I'm not a member of the Cabinet, so they ceased the discussion." 
12 That ring any bells, or do you recall talking to Secretary Pompeo in General 
13 Milley's presence about the 25th Amendment? 
14 A I mean, I do recall speaking to Secretary Pompeo about the 25th 
15 Amendment. I don't recall it being in that circumstance, and I surely don't recall that I 
16 stopped the conversation when General Milley came up. 
17 Q Okay. Let's talk then about your conversations with Secretary Pompeo or 
18 others about that topic of the 25th Amendment. 
19 Tell me, when was the first time that you had any such discussion, either on or 
20 after January 6th? 
21 
22 
23 A 
Q 
A Okay. Again, I just want to put this in perspective on timing. 
Yes. 
So I think, as you are aware, kind of during the month of December I was 
24 very, very busy negotiating with Congress both what was the CARES Act and 
25 the additional funding of government, which I believe President Trump signed on  12 
1 December 28th. So that was really my full-time focus. 
2 I then ended up leaving shortly for vacation. I came back. And then I went on a 
3 planned trip to Egypt, Sudan, and other countries in the Mideast. I cut that trip short, 
4 and then I came back. 
5 So I believe the conversation that you're referencing must have been, you 
6 know --we can check the exact date I got back, but it was not in the first few days. 
7 
8 Q 
A I see. 
So, again, my conversations with Secretary Pompeo, when I got back, this 
9 was all over the press. So every time you turned on TV, there was the 25th Amendment. 
10 It came up very briefly in our conversation. We both believed that the best 
11 outcome was a normal transition of power, which was working, and neither one of us 
12 contemplated in any serious format the 25th Amendment. 
13 Q I see. Did you or anyone on your behalf do any kind of research into the 
14 predicates for the invocation of the act or sort of --
15 A The only research I did out of curiosity was I googled it. It came up. 
16 remember my general counsel asking me if we wanted him to do extensive research on it. 
17 I said, no, not at this point. 
Q Okay. I see Ms. Lofgren has joined us, a member of the committee. 18 
19 
20 So you talked to Secretary Pompeo about that prospect? 
A Again, it came up in a conversation. I can't recall in date whether it was in 
21 the conversation with General Milley or whether it was in a different conversation that 
22 we had. 
23 Q Okay. Do you remember talking about the 25th Amendment with any 
24 other members of the President's Cabinet? 
25 A I don't.  13 
1 Q Okay. Do you remember talking about it on the telephone in addition to 
2 the in-person discussion that General Milley referenced? 
3 A I recall discussing it on the telephone. I don't particularly recall the 
4 meeting with General Milley. But, again, it sounds like a meeting where the three of us 
5 were together in the Situation Room. 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Okay. Do you recall a telephone conversation with Pompeo about it? 
Yes. 
I see. Anyone else that you talked to on the phone? 
No. 
All right. There's a --let me read you a passage from Jonathan Karl's book. 
I'm familiar with it, but go ahead. 
He said, "Mnuchin did have conversations with other members, plural, of the 
13 Cabinet that night, January 6th, and the next morning on a step much more dramatic than 
14 issuing a statement. According to a source familiar with the conversations, Mnuchin 
15 talked to other members of the Cabinet about attempting to remove Trump from office 
16 by invoking the 25th Amendment. Among the Cabinet officials Mnuchin spoke to that 
17 night was Secretary of State Pompeo." 
18 Again, is that accurate? Does that refresh any recollection? 
19 A It is completely inaccurate. I can tell you I did speak to Jonathan Karl on 
20 background. What I told him --he asked me about the 25th Amendment. I said that I 
21 was not going to make any comments on the 25th Amendment, that I didn't think it was 
22 appropriate in that format, and that he shouldn't take that as meaning that there were 
23 conversations or there weren't conversations. 
24 He also asked me whether I had a conversation separately with Secretary Pompeo, 
25 and I answered I had spoken to Secretary Pompeo after January 6th, not referencing that  14 
1 I spoke to him about the 25th Amendment. 
2 So if he has that information from other people, I believe it's inaccurate. 
3 Q I see. Okay. And I take it from your answer, Secretary Mnuchin, that you 
4 never personally formed the view that President Trump was incapable of carrying out the 
5 functions of the office or had mental illness sufficient to trigger invocation of the 25th 
6 Amendment. 
7 A Again, I never did the legal research on the 25th Amendment. But, again, 
8 putting aside the elections, I believed that he was able to and we did have a normal 
9 functioning of the government. 
10 Q I see. Did you ever speak to Vice President Pence or any members of his 
11 staff about the 25th Amendment? 
12 
13 A 
Q I don't recall. 
Okay. So just to be clear, you don't remember any conversations with 
14 anyone other than Secretary Pompeo? 
15 
16 A 
Q That's correct. 
Okay. All right. Let me ask you about some other steps that were 
17 discussed in the days after January 6th to ensure functioning of government and a 
18 transition. 
19 We interviewed Secretary Scalia, and he told us that he thought perhaps a Cabinet 
20 meeting should be convened and that the Cabinet should be more directly involved in big 
21 decisions in the last 2 weeks of the administration. 
22 Do you remember hearing about that or having --
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A I do not. 
Okay. You didn't talk to Scalia or others? 
Again, I may have spoken to Scalia during that period. I don't ever  15 
1 remember having a conversation as you've described and him saying there should be a 
2 Cabinet meeting. 
Okay. Did anyone raise that prospect with you? 3 
4 Q 
A No. I mean, I would also just say in terms of Cabinet meetings, most of the 
5 functioning of the government that we did was outside of Cabinet meetings. So it would 
6 be a little bit of an odd request. 
7 Q Yeah. Were there any discussions about, beyond the 25th Amendment or a 
8 Cabinet meeting, other steps that should be taken to ensure smooth function of 
9 government between January 6th and January 20th that you were involved in yourself? 
10 
11 A 
Q I'm sorry, give that to me again. 
Were there any other steps discussed, that you discussed with anybody else, 
12 about specific things that needed to be done, so in the wake of January 6th, to make sure 
13 that the term was finished appropriately? 
14 A Not in the wake of January 6th. There were other things that were part of 
15 a normal transition that were discussed, things that are similar to any other Presidential 
16 transition, and they were proceeding properly. 
17 Q Okay. Did you ever at any time perceive resistance to cooperating with the 
18 transition, even going back before January 6th, from the White House or anyone else? 
19 A So if you recall, I believe it was in late November, the GSA certified the funds 
20 for the transition committee. 
21 
22 Q 
A Right. 
We had been working internally on transition plans before the election, 
23 which is required no matter who wins the election. We continued to work on them. 
24 And then I believe it was after November 26th or 28th, I forget what the date was, 
25 when that was certified we were told by the White House that we could proceed and  16 
1 speak to --in that case, I spoke to Janet Yellen several times. 
2 
3 
4 Q 
A 
Q Okay. I think that's called ascertainment or something like that. 
You can google the document. It's out there. 
Yeah. But it sounds like once that occurred, the funds were appropriated, 
5 there was no --you never perceived any resistance. 
6 A No, none whatsoever. We had professional career staff who were working 
7 on it. As I said, I had several conversations with Janet Yellen during that period of time. 
8 
9 Q I see. Okay. 
I see that Mr. Aguilar has joined us as well, a second member of the committee. 
10 All right. So several of your colleagues in the Cabinet did resign, right, on or soon 
11 after January 6th. Did you have any conversations with either Secretary DeVos or 
12 Secretary Chao about their decisions to resign? 
13 
14 
15 A 
Q 
A I did not. 
Did you yourself consider resigning? 
I absolutely didn't. And let me be clear. I absolutely believed that the 
16 best thing I could do to serve the American people was to continue in my job. As I said, 
17 we had a lot of work to do in those last 2 weeks. 
18 Q Yeah. Do you remember discussions with anyone who didn't resign who 
19 was contemplating it, Cabinet or otherwise, as a result of January 6th? 
20 A No. I'd say everybody else who didn't resign, again, there was a lot of work 
21 going on independent of the election. Again, as it relates to the CARES Act, we had a lot 
22 of work we were working on right until the very end. 
23 Q Yeah. Just going back, looking over my notes, Secretary Mnuchin, you 
24 issued a statement by tweet on the night of January 6th. I guess it was very late at night 
25 where you were in Israel.  17 
1 "Violence is always unacceptable. We must respect our Constitution and 
2 democratic processes." 
3 It's something that was drafted for you, you drafted yourself? Do you recall how 
4 that came about? 
5 A It was a combination. Typical of these types of tweets, it was a 
6 combination of myself, my communications staff, and other staff members. But I signed 
7 off on that tweet. 
8 Q Okay. And why was it important to use those words or to issue that 
9 message, in your view? 
10 A I thought it was important. I was out of the country. And, obviously, this 
11 was something I was watching on TV. And I thought it was appropriate. 
12 Q When you say, "We must respect our Constitution and democratic 
13 processes," why --beyond violence --why did you feel it necessary to include a reference 
14 to the Constitution and the democratic process? 
15 A Again, I thought it was appropriate. I can't remember the specific things. 
16 But, again, it was --we thought it was appropriate. 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Okay. Did you clear that or notify the White House in any way before --
1 did not. 
You were able, as a Cabinet Secretary -­
But I wouldn't normally have done that. 
Yeah. Okay. Okay. All right. 
22 So, again, no conversations with DeVos or Chao or anyone else about resignations, 
23 that you remember? 
24 
25 A 
Q I don't recall anything, no. 
Okay. You mentioned a conversation with Vice President Pence. Is there  18 
1 anything else or any other conversations with him that you had, either about January 6th 
2 or about sort of transition or the last 2 weeks? 
3 
4 
5 
6 A 
Q 
A 
Q I just recall one conversation with him during that period of time. 
Yeah. The one you mentioned earlier? 
Yes. 
Okay. I also wanted to ask you about a name of Jeff Clark. Do you know 
7 Jeff Clark, who was a lawyer at the Justice Department? 
8 A Yes. 
9 Q How do you know Jeff Clark? 
10 A Yeah. I met Jeff Clark --so let me be clear. I didn't have any 
11 conversations during this period of time with Jeff Clark whatsoever. I met Jeff Clark 
12 socially earlier on, and he was involved in certain areas around animal rights and other 
13 things that we had an interest in. But I never --I never spoke to him within the period 
14 of, you know, kind of January on. 
15 Q Okay. So you didn't have any discussions with him about his interest in 
16 election fraud? 
17 
18 A 
Q No. I was --I watched on TV and was surprised. 
I see. Okay. Certainly no discussions with anyone about him becoming 
19 Acting Attorney General? 
20 A Absolutely not.

25 Q 
A 
Q Okay. Discussion with the President about him, did you ever -­
No. 
Okay. All right. 
Mr. Aguilar or Ms. Lofgren, do you have any questions? 
Ms. Lofgren. No, thank you.  Mr. Aguilar. No questions. 
No? Okay. 
-anything?

5 Q Mr. Mnuchin, I just wanted to go back real quick to your conversations with 
6 Secretary Pompeo. 
7 So just so I'm clear, did you say there are two separate conversations that you can 
8 recall with Secretary Pompeo, one in the Situation Room and another over the phone, 
9 where the 25th Amendment was brought up? 
10 
11 
12 A 
Q 
A So, again, I recall the conversation over the phone. 
Okay. 
Again, since you've referenced to me and General Milley said, I have no 
13 reason to believe he's not accurate, but I don't remember that conversation. 
14 
15 
16 Q 
A 
Q So you recall one phone conversation? 
I do. But the other one may have been the case. 
Do you recall, just generally, the 25th Amendment coming up more than 
17 once in conversations that you had during the post-January 6th time period? 
18 A Again, what I recall was it was all over the press, and everybody was 
19 tweeting about it, and my name was in a lot of the tweets, again, you know, from the 
20 period I was coming back for the next 1 or 2 days. And, you know, so, again, it came up 
21 in that context and then, no, we didn't discuss it after that. 
22 
23 Q 
A And what do you recall Secretary Pompeo saying to you on the topic? 
Again, I think we both had the same view, which was, you know, we were 
24 supportive of an orderly transition of government, and we saw the government 
25 functioning and thought that was the best outcome.  20 
1 Q Did Secretary Pompeo share with you if he was talking to anyone else about 
2 the topic? 
3 
4 A 
Q He didn't share that. 
And it sounds like he was not of the opinion, from what you could tell, about 
5 invoking the 25th Amendment? 
6 A I think we were both of the opinion at that time that the best thing was to 
7 proceed with a normal transition of power.

14 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Have you talked to President Trump since you both left office January the 
I have. 
Have you talked to him at all about January 6th? 
I have not. 
Okay. How about about your testimony today? Other than your lawyers, 
15 I don't want to hear about your conversations with them, but have you talked to anyone 
16 else about the fact that you were going to be here talking to us today? 
17 A I told my wife and I told people in my office today in case this leaked into the 
18 press they were not surprised. 
19 Q Yeah. Okay. But --and I appreciate that. But sort of on the merits, any 
20 substantive discussion with --
21 
22 
23 
24 A 
Q 
A 
Q None. 
--anyone else about the subject matter of your testimony? 
No. 
Okay. And fairly --another standard question. Did anyone in any way try 
25 to influence your testimony, encourage you to do or not do certain things when you  1 provide information to us? 
2 A No. And, again, I just want to clarify one thing since I did reach out to 
3 Secretary Pompeo to get his lawyer's information and put our lawyers in touch. That 
4 was the extent of my conversation with him about today. 
5 
6 Q I appreciate that. Okay. 
Okay. I don't have any other questions. And if Ms. Lofgren or 
7 Mr. Aguilar do not either, then I think we can go off the record.
