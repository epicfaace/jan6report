Dear Molly, 
I also promised a copy of this for the president. yesterday. 
Dear President Trump, 
As we discussed yesterday, attached is the Amicus brief that 30 members of the 
PA Senate and House (myself included) signed to join with the Kelley/Parnell 
case regarding the changes to our voting laws, which ushered in the troubles 
that we are facing today. This is a very strong case in that our state supreme 
court rewrote portions of the voting law in contravention to the constitution. 
Additionally, the Wolf Administration made further changes that compromised 
voting in the commonwealth. 
Sincerely, 
Sen Doug Mastriano
