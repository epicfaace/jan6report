Deliberative 
Predecisional 
E-mail to component heads, Chair/Vice Chair of AGAC, ODAG/OAG staff 
Dear all -
Apologies for the impersonal nature of this e-mail. 
This evening, after Acting Attorney General Jeff Rosen over the course of the last week repeatedly 
refused the President's direct instructions to utilize the Department of Justice's law enforcement 
powers for improper ends, the President removed Jeff from the Department. 
PADAG Rich Donoghue and I resign from the Department, effective immediately. 
Jeff loves the Department of Justice, as we all do. Preserving and defending the institutional integrity of 
the Department remains Jeff's paramount concern. The decision of whether and when to resign and 
whether the ends of justice are best served by resigning is a highly individual question, informed by 
personal and family circumstances. Jeff asked me to pass on to each of you that whatever your own 
decision, he knows you will adhere always to the highest standards of justice and act always -and onlyÂ­
in the interests of the United States. 
It has been a high honor to serve with each of you. 
Best, 
Pat 
Patrick Hovakimian
