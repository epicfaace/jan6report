Even Caroline isn't in the loop of everything. She leaked a false story to Breitbart and its upset 
a lot of people 
1/4/21, 9:32 AM 
I don't have any control or knowledge about tomorrow. I will try and find out but maybe better 
you stay away from the crazies like Alex jones, etc that speak tomorrow and just speak 
Wednesday. 
This stays only between us, we are having a second stage at the Supreme Court again after 
the ellipse. POTUS is going to have us march there/the Capitol. 
II cannot get out about the second stage because people will try and set another up and 
Sabotage ii. II can also not get out about the march because I will be in trouble with the 
national park service and all the agencies but POTUS is going to just call for ii "unexpectedly" 
POTUS is confirming speaking schedule for ellipse and we should have by COB today. 
If anyone tells you otherwise, it's not accurate info. Only myself and Katrina know full story 
of what is actually happening and we are having to appease many people by saying certain 
things.

So we are trying to make sure you're okay with us scrapping Nashville all together and just 
staying in Atlanta. 
If we change the venue, same thing is going to happen. So we want to focus on Georgia. Just 
want you to be okay with changes

Hey Mike! 
Can you do a quick audio recording on your phone for a radio ad? I am emailing you a script. 
We are going to place radio ads in these cities after Georgia (so expensive because of the 
senate race)

Are you able to jump on a call with me and Amy (my mom) today to go over a couple of 
things? 
We announced last night UFC fighter Jorge Masvidal is joining for the kickoff. 
We wanted to get with you on the schedule and see when you will be joining us. 
Also, is there anyway a transfer can be made to WFAF today?

Good morning Mike! 
Whatever works best for you. I am still working on finalizing the things we discussed yesterday 
and working on gelling them to you. 
We are cancelling our event in Atlanta this weekend and I had to work on gelling the word out 
and with our press guy to get a press release out. 
As far as which organization/company you would like to do this under ... whatever is best for 
you! 
I will circle back in a couple of hours.

We can co-sponsor the whole thing
