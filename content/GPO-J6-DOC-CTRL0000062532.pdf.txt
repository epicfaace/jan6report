DonaldsArmy.US and BASEDMedia 
Overview 
On the evening of December 19, 2020, Donald Trump posted a tweet continuing his claims around 
election fraud during the 2020 Presidential Election, as well as a call to action for his followers to rally to 
a protest in Washington, D.C. on January 6th. Following the tweet, we started to see some activity on the 
forum TheDonald.win (a forum connected to r/TheDonald and The Donald Discord server, and one that 
we have been watching since the election for potential violence escalation) about the call to protest.

Recommended Action 
DonaldsArmy.US -Delete Server with All Members 
HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL JANGC_D15_000290  Rationale 
It is clear that the DonaldsArmy.US server is a highly organized planning server being to organize a 
January 6, 2021 protest in Washington, DC. While not all members of this server or movement may be 
planning for violence, there are numerous conversations in the various state-organized chats where 
users are discussing the weapons they plan to bring to the protest (firearms or otherwise) with no 
apparent moderation happening around those discussions. 
The organizers of the server and planning also appear to identify themselves and the group/movement 
around the notion that force or violence is a tactic they are willing to used, based on the fact that they 
refer to themselves as "an army" and in one of the organizer's advertised "Email script" offered to 
members for use in recruitment, they explicitly mention that they will implement "guerrilla-style 
deployment" 
Redacted 
In addition to the content found on the server, the clear links of the server and the movement to 
TheDonald.win and the comments left on that forum with both implicit and explicit calls to violence 
indicate that the event being planned in the DonaldsArmy.US server has the high potential to result in 
real-world harm. For this reason, we are recommending to delete the server with all members and will 
heavily monitor ban appeals coming in to correct any false positives. 
BASEDMedia -Delete Server 
Rationale 
We did not find as explicit organizing and planning occurring in the BASEDMedia server, but the space is 
clearly being used by the server owner and some of the organizers of DonaldsArmy.US to try and recruit 
others to their plan to build an "army" of protestors. 
The clear connection between this server and its owner and the DonaldsArmy.US server leads us to 
conclude that taking down this server is imperative to ensuring that the organizers of DonaldsArmy.US 
do not use the space as an easy place to regroup. Because this server is not heavily involved in the 
organizing outside of the admins, we are recommending to delete the server without all members, with 
the expectation that users who are active participants in both servers will be banned with the 
DonaldsArmy.US server ban. 
Follow-Up Steps 
• Monitor Extremism ban appeals for potential false positives (users who joined the server to report it, 
were in the "wrong place, wrong time") and to potentially review server lists of some of the organizers 
for other potentially problematic servers 
HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL JANGC_DI5_000291  • Ensure that tickets of this nature are not auto-solved out and are instead escalated to HP: 
httRs://hammerandchisel.zendesk.com/agenUtickets/10610930 
• Work with the On Point team to ensure that future escalations like this get a ping and eyes on them 
immediately 
o The situation and server were escalated in the TnS chat in the HQ Server, but an additional ping 
for the concern of violence would be very helpful for next time
