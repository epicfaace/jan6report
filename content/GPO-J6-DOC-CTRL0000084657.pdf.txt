Thanks Molly. I will arrive a bit before 530 at that gate. I used to practice law for 15 years just a few blocks away in the 
Old Ebbitt building.

Hi Mr. Clark, 
Attached is the map for your arrival today. The gate is on the East Wing -Pennsylvania Ave and Madison 
Place. 
I will have a Secret Service agent meeting you at the gate to ensure there is no issue with arrival. From 
there you will be escorted to-and then to the meeting. 
Please let me know if you have any questions and call if you have any issues -2.02-456-3570

-thank you! 
I will let you know the entrance by late morning tomorrow. We just have several gates 
under construction, so I need to circle back with you.

Molly thanks. I have filled out WAVES. I'll be arriving on foot. 
I'll take-as directed. 
Let me know when you can describe what entrance I present myself at. 
Thanks again,

Hi Mr. Clark,

We will need to do on arrival, but there is no need to 
arrive any earlier than 5:30PM. The meeting will likely take place in the 
private residence, but I will confirm. 
As I determine the best entrance for tomorrow, can I ask -do you want 
parking on complex? Or would you rather arrive on foot? 
Thanks!
