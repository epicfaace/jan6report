2 - Good afternoon, everyone. We can go on the record at 2:05 p.m. 
3 This is a deposition of John Matze conducted by the House Select Committee to 
4 Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol pursuant to House 
5 Resolution 503. 
6 At this time, Mr. Matze, can you please state your full name and spell your last 
7 name for the record? 
8 The Witness. Yes. John Edward Gerard Matze, and the last name is spelled 
9 M-a-t-z-e. 
10 - Thank you for the pronunciation, too. 
11 At this time, Mr. Matze, can you please raise your right hand to be sworn by the 
12 official reporter? 
13 The Reporter. Do you solemnly declare and affirm under the penalty of perjury 
14 that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing 
15 but the truth? 
16 The Witness. I do. 
17 - Thank you. 
18 So this is going to be a staff-led deposition, although members of the select 
19 committee may, of course, choose to enter and ask questions. I'll note at the time that 
20 we are starting the deposition there are no members in the Zoom, although some may 
21 join. 
22 My name is- investigative counsel. Other select committee staff 3 
23 joining today are investigative analyst; professional staff 
24 member; and senior administrative assistant. And as I said, there are 
25 currently no members in attendance.  4 
1 I would like to note for the record that what has been previously marked as 
2 exhibit 1 is the subpoena for Mr. John Matze, which is dated April 29, 2022. The House 
3 deposition rules are included in this exhibit and were provided to you upon service of the 
4 subpoena. 
5 Under House deposition rules you are permitted to have an attorney present. 
6 So at this time, I would like to ask counsel for the witness to state their names for 
7 the record. 
8 Mr.~ Sure. Brian Kelly and Lauren Maynard of Nixon Peabody on behalf of 
9 Mr. Matze. 
10 
11 - Great. Thank you. 
I also want to remind you, as we do with all witnesses, that it's unlawful to 
12 deliberately provide false information to Congress. Providing false information to 
13 Congress could result in a criminal penalty, including for perjury and/or providing false 
14 statements. 
15 Under House deposition rules, you may only refuse to answer a question to 
16 preserve a privilege recognized by the select committee. If you refuse to answer a 
17 question based on a privilege, staff may either proceed with the deposition or seek a 
18 ruling from the chairman on the objection. If the chairman overrules your objection, 
19 you will be required to answer the question. 
20 I'll note for the record that we received a letter from your attorney on Monday 
21 regarding your objections based on the Fifth Amendment. The letter has been marked 
22 as exhibit 7, and will be entered into the record. 
23 I've noted in correspondence with your counsel, Mr. Kelly, that the select 
24 committee still expects you to appear for this deposition today, and invoke the Fifth 
25 Amendment for any questions that you believe implicate potential self-incrimination  5 
1 concerns. And we thank you for appearing for the deposition today. 
2 My goal today is to ask you questions relevant to the select committee's 
3 investigation with the hope that you will answer. If you have an objection or privilege 
4 assertion, we will ask that you or your counsel assert it for the record. I may seek to 
5 clarify the basis for each objection. I understand from your letter that you may be 
6 invoking the Fifth Amendment to many of our questions today. But be that as it may, I 
7 will say that our goal remains to understand the basis for your objection and fairly 
8 evaluate it. 
9 Ultimately, the more detail that you can provide, or your counsel can provide 
10 about the basis for the objection, the easier it will be for the select committee to consider 
11 the objection in full. 
12 In addition, under the House deposition rules, select committee members and 
13 select committee staff may not discuss the substance of the testimony you provide today 
14 unless the committee approves release of the transcript that is being created. You and 
15 your attorney will have the opportunity to review the transcript. You are free to discuss 
16 this deposition as much or as little as you like. No other recordings of this proceeding 
17 are permitted. 
18 So with that in mind, Mr. Matze, can you please confirm that you are not making 
19 an audio or video recording of this deposition? 
20 
21 
22 
23 The Witness. I am not. 
- Great. Thank you. 
All right. So before we begin, I would just like to describe a few logistics. 
There is an official congressional reporter on the Zoom who is recording the 
24 deposition. Please wait until each question is completed before you begin your 
25 response, and we will try to wait until your response is complete before we ask our next  6 
1 question. The reporter cannot record any nonverbal responses, such as shaking your 
2 head or nodding your head, so it's important you answer each question with an audible or 
3 verbal response. For the benefit of the reporter and for the record, there may be times 
4 when I spell a name or a word we are using or ask you to do the same. 
5 We ask that you provide complete answers based on your best recollection of 
6 events. If the question is not clear, please ask for clarification. If you don't know the 
7 answer, please simply say so. 
8 And please let us know if you need any breaks. As I mentioned before we went 
9 on the record, I'll try to take a break about every hour if we need it. 
10 Throughout the deposition we'll also be directing your attention to exhibits which 
11 were provided to you before the beginning of this call. They will also be displayed on 
12 your screen here on the Zoom. So when we refer to a document, you can take time to 
13 familiarize yourself with it on the screen, or if you have a copy with you before we discuss 
14 it. 
15 
16 So on that note, can we pull up exhibit 1? 
The Witness. In the meantime, I do have a question. Am I permitted to take 
17 notes on questions asked? 
18 - I believe that's all right, so long as you are keeping that for your own 
19 use during the deposition, yes. 
20 
21 
22 
23 The Witness. Understood. 
- But I can also get back to you on that. 
The Witness. Okay. 
- Indeed, my intuition was correct. You are able to take notes, just 
24 cannot record. 
25 The Witness. Got it. Thank you.  1 - And I want to note on that chief clerk, is also in the 
2 Zoom today. 
3 So this exhibit 1, on this exhibit, Mr. Matze, do you recognize this subpoena that 
4 the select committee has issued to you? 
5 The Witness. Yes, I do. 
6 Mr.~ That's okay to answer that, John. 
7 - And do you understand that you're appearing for this deposition 
8 pursuant to the subpoena? 
9 
10 
11 The Witness. Yes, I do. 
- Thankyou. 
So I will be leading the deposition today, but- and may 
12 chime in with questions, and others may join later on as well, but I will be asking the 
13 majority of questions. 
14 On that note, do you have any questions before we begin? 
15 
16 The Witness. No. 
Mr.~ My question is, did you say our letter to the chairman on May 23rd is 
17 exhibit 7 in this --
18 
19 - Yes,itis. 
Mr.~ Okay. So I'll tell you at the outset that the basis of our objections 
20 going forward is predicated on that letter, exhibit 7, both the factual and legal citations 
21 that we put in that letter. 
22 
23 
24 
25 Great. Thank you, Mr. Kelly. 
EXAMINATION BY-
Q So to start off, Mr. Matze, I would like to start off with some basic 7  1 background questions before we move into a more substantive conversation. 
2 First, what is your age? 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A I'm currently 29 years old. 
Great. Where did you grow up? 
I grew up in Southern California in a town called Poway. 
And what's your educational history? 
Um, well, so I went to high school in Poway, and I went to college at the 
8 University of Denver, where I received a Bachelor of Science in computer science. 
9 
10 
11 Q Great. Thank you. 
Where do you live now? 
Mr.~ I'm going to object to that. Given the public nature of this 
12 proceeding, I don't want his address out in public. 
13 - So is that a First Amendment objection, Fifth Amendment objection? 
14 The Witness. Brian, would it be okay just to say the general city that I'm 
15 currently in and/or living in rather than my exact address? 
16 
17 
18 
19 Mr.~ General city is fine, general city is fine. 
The Witness. Is that okay with the committee? 
- Ofcourse. 
The Witness. Okay. Henderson, Nevada, is both where I reside and where I 
20 currently am? 
21 BY 
22 
23 
24 
25 Q 
A 
Q 
A Thank you. Have you ever served in the military or law enforcement? 
I have not. 
And where are you currently employed? 
I am currently self-employed. 8  1 
2 Q 
A 9 
Doing what? 
I am a software engineer --well, it's hard to kind of say. It's a really unique 
3 position, but I would say a software engineering manager of sorts and a product manager. 
4 Q I've got a law degree, so it's all above my head, but thank you. 
5 Have you ever been employed by the Federal Government? 
6 A Not directly. Um, I worked for a government contractor at one point doing 
7 software engineering. 
8 
9 
10 
11 Q 
A 
Q 
A Okay. Where and when was that? 
That was --oh, gosh, right after I graduated college. 
2015-ish? 
Yes, I would assume. I'm bad with dates and specifics, all that kind of stuff, 
12 but, yes, that's kind of --right of after college, whenever that was. 
13 Q Okay. Thank you. 
14 And last question on this, could you give me a general sense of your employment 
15 history over the last decade or so? 
16 A Um, yeah. It's --so, I mean, I started kind of working when I was in high 
17 school as an engineer. That was more mechanical engineering-focused, where I was 
18 running a lot of --I was part of a lot of robotics programs. 
19 And so from there, I went to college. I worked as a --pivoted and worked as a 
20 software engineer doing website development during my college years. Then I worked 
21 for General Atomics doing software engineering work on the MQ-9B weapon system. 
22 After being there for about some time, I decided I would try to start my own 
23 consultant company, did relatively poorly for quite some time. And then managed to 
24 finally land a contract where I was doing iPhone app development, which kind of started 
25 my career in application development and product and managing businesses, and did that  10 
1 for a number of years, tried to work at Amazon Web Services for a while. Did --didn't 
2 like it, didn't like the structure, so after 3 months, I quit. 
3 And then from there I continued to do software development as a consultant for 
4 people and management services, and at some point, I founded Parler. So that was kind 
5 of the history. 
6 
7 Q Thank you. That was very helpful. 
And that brings me right to our next question because in 2018, I believe, you 
8 founded Parler. So is it correct you were the founder, one of the founders, and full-time 
9 CEO of Parler? 
10 Mr.~ Okay. I'm going to object to all questions going forward that pertain 
11 to Parler and Mr. Matze based upon the Fifth Amendment. 
12 And John --
13 - Thank you, Mr. Kelly. 
14 So I'm understanding that you're going to refuse to answer any questions 
15 pertaining to Parler on Fifth Amendment grounds. And, obviously, the Fifth Amendment 
16 relates to self-incrimination, and we're seeking to better understand the circumstances 
17 leading up to the attack on the Capitol pursuant to H. Res. 503, and that includes a 
18 mandate to examine the facts and circumstances and causes of the attack related to the 
19 peaceful transfer of power in order to identify and evaluate lessons learned. 
20 So I am struggling to see --and I know you mentioned your letter. I'm struggling 
21 to see how the Fifth Amendment relates to a question about Mr. Matze's status as CEO of 
22 Parler, which is an extremely public fact, and --
23 Mr.~ Any questions related to Parler that you're trying to elicit from him, 
24 the answers may link him, provide a link in the chain that could be used to prosecute him 
25 when, in fact, your cover letter, as we stated in exhibit 7, talks about how Parler helped  11 
1 fuel the spread of election-related disinformation, violent context in the weeks and 
2 months prior to the attack on the Capitol, as well as January 6th itself. 
3 And as we also explained in our letter, Congresswoman Maloney has referred to 
4 the FBI a letter which said that Parler, you know, should be investigated as a potential 
5 facilitator of planning and incitement relating to violence. 
6 So in that context, in light of the uncertainties of where this is all headed, Mr. 
7 Matze most definitely has a Fifth Amendment privilege, and he intends to rely upon it 
8 going forward in this deposition. 
9 - Thank you for that explanation. 
10 And I would still ask you to --if you could explain more fully the specific grounds 
11 for a Fifth Amendment claim that relates to basic questions about Mr. Matze's 
12 employment at Parler, general questions, but --
13 Mr.~ Well, Parler is under investigation. Parler is clearly under 
14 investigation by your committee. He was the CEO of Parler. Under a Supreme Court 
15 precedent, I think it's Ohio v. Reiner, you know, if his answers might tend to incriminate 
16 him in your probe, that's a problem. And you have refused to give him immunity. He 
17 would be more than willing to testify here if he was immunized and he was told whatever 
18 he said would not be used against him, but your committee has refused to do that, 
19 maybe because you don't have the authority to do that. But be that as it may, he finds 
20 himself here being questioned about a company that's apparently viewed as facilitating 
21 an attack on the United States. 
22 So as the former CEO of that company at that time, that raises Fifth Amendment 
23 concerns for me as his counsel, and that's why he's going to --one of many reasons why 
24 he's going to invoke right now. 
25 - Understood. So we'll note that objection for the record, and we can  12 
1 return to it at the end of the deposition. 
2 But for now we do have several questions we would like to ask Mr. Matze, and if 
3 the objection is the same as you've just laid out, then I would ask that you state that, and 
4 you can say it briefly. If you would like, Mr. Matze, or you, Mr. Kelly, could simply state 
5 "Fifth" as a shorthand for Fifth Amendment, and we'll understand that to mean that 
6 everything you just said applies to that question and the objections to that particular 
7 question, and we can proceed like that. 
8 Is that all right? 
9 Mr.~ Yes. I'll say, Same objection; Fifth Amendment, and that will 
10 encompass what I just said, as well as exhibit 7 what I said there as well. 
11 - That sounds great. 
12 So I'm just going to keep going through these questions, and if at any point, you 
13 do see a Fifth Amendment objection, please say so. 
14 BY 
15 Q All right. Well, so is it true, Mr. Matze, that you were one of the 
16 cofounders and CEO of the social media website Parler?

14 2020, that showcases instances in which Parler has allowed anti-Semitic, anti-Muslim, 20 
15 anti-immigrant, anti-Black, and anti-LGBTQ content to remain on the platform, as well as 
16 conspiracy theories related to COVID-19, inciting of violence, and content from violent far

Q Prior to January 6th, there were several events that featured violent activity 
23 by groups that still had a platform on Parler, such as skirmishes involving the Proud Boys 
24 in Washington, D.C., on November 14 and December 12, 2020. In addition, on 
25 December 12, Stewart Rhodes, leader of the Oath Keepers, called for President Trump to,  23 
1 quote/unquote, "drop the hammer" on traitors and invoke the Insurrection Act, calling up 
2 veterans as a militia to head off a much more desperate and bloody civil war, and this led 
3 to the Jericho March in December 2020, December 12th, in Washington, D.C. 
4 As rhetorics run and the election grew more violent in November and December,

18 Fifth Amendment privilege, I respectfully decline to answer. 
19 Q Thank you. 
20 Based on the best of your recollection, Mr. Matze, was there a noticeable shift in

16 invoking the Fifth Amendment based on advice of counsel.

Did Parler rely solely on user reports to identify content that was potentially

4 So, Mr. Matze, this is a Parler post that begins with the quote: "We need to mass 
5 an armed force of American patriots 150,000 on the Virginia side of the Potomac River 
6 prepared to react to the congressional events of January 6th." 
7 It goes on to say towards the bottom that it is a right and a duty of the people to, 
8 quote, "throw off an abusive government." 
9 This post was referred to law enforcement by Parler, correct? 
10 Mr.~ Same objection; Fifth Amendment.

Q I did, I did. I said Fifth in response. 
Okay. Thank you. 
I think we missed one, but otherwise, yes. 
Were there any steps taken by Parler employees to actively search for more 
8 content that was similar to this? 
9 
10 Mr.~ Same objection; Fifth. 
The Witness. Fifth. 
11 - And, Mr. Kelly, if you want to say "Same objection" so that we don't 
12 have the two Fifths in a row to make things go a little faster, I'll understand that to mean

Q Is it your intention to raise the Fifth Amendment in response to any and all 
22 questions the committee would ask about this post or other kinds of posts prior to 
23 January 6th? 
24 
25 A 
Q Yes. 
in that case, could we pull up exhibit 5?  1 So this is an email sent from a Parler employee to the FBI on January 2, 2021, 
2 apparently referring to another post that Parler had sent to the FBI. In the email, the 
3 employee writes: "More where this came from. Concerned about Wednesday." 
Of course, that Wednesday was January 6th. 
Are you familiar with this email? 30 
4 
5 
6 Mr.~ So just so I'm clear, this is an email from Parler warning the FBI days in 
7 advance of the attack? Is that right? 
8 - Yes. This is an email saying concerned about Wednesday on 
9 January 2nd.

16 questions the committee would ask about Parler's response to January 6th? 
17 
18 A 
Q That is correct. 
All right. at this point could we pull up exhibit 3? 
19 So this is a post that was also apparently referred to the FBI by Parler which calls 
20 for individuals to, quote, "shoot their way into D.C. if they blockade" --"they" being 
21 nebulous and in quotes --"the city on Inauguration Day." 
22 It seems like this post is made after January 6th. So, Mr. Matze, I want to ask 
23 you, did calls for coordinated violence, like this one, continue to proliferate on Parler 
24 after the attack on the Capitol? 
25 Mr.~ Same objection.  34

Q Thank you. Getting through this. 2 
3 
4 The next thing I wanted to ask you about is the deplatforming of Parler. So a few 
5 days after the attack on the Capitol, Parler was removed from the Apple and Google App 
6 Stores for failure to adequately police violent content on the platform. And then on 
7 January 10, 2021, Parler went offline altogether after Amazon Web Services banned it 
8 from its servers. 
9 So I want to ask you, Mr. Matze, what was your reaction to these actions by Apple, 
10 Google, and Amazon?

14 A 
Q Yes, that's correct. 
Thank you, Mr. Matze. 
So at the end of January 2021, you were removed as CEO of Parler while the sites 
15 still offline. After your removal, you claimed in public interviews that you were 
16 terminated because you had been advocating for more effective content moderation 
17 policies on the platform, and that you had been unsuccessfully lobbying Parler's board to 
18 crack down on domestic terrorists, White supremacists, and other groups, like QAnon. 
19 In fact, you claimed in interviews following your termination that you had argued to 
20 others at Parler that January 6th was a clear indication of what could happen absent 
21 further content moderation changes at Parler. 
22 So, Mr. Matze, in your opinion, is it true that you were terminated from Parler 
23 because you were pushing for more effective content moderation policies in the wake of 
24 January 6th?

3 ask about --with regards to contacts made by law enforcement or others regarding the 
4 events of January 6th, 2021? 
5 
6 A 
Q That is correct. 
Thank you. So on the issue of productions pursuant to the subpoena, Mr. 
7 Matze, I've been in discussions with Mr. Kelly about your efforts to comply with requests 
8 for documents contained in the subpoena. 
9 In an email on Monday, your counsel indicated that you will not produce 
10 documents that are subject to a privilege held by Parler. 
11 However, can you confirm that you will still be producing documents that your 
12 attorney has indicated attorney are in your possession and are not covered by a privilege 
13 controlled by Parler? 
14 Mr.~ Well, if they're not privileged, whether it's Fifth Amendment privilege 
15 or Parler's privilege, and they're responsive as indicated, we'll produce them. But we 
16 still have --going through them now. 
17 - I just wanted to confirm that. 
18 The Witness. Yeah. And I will note that they should have them in their 
19 possession. Albeit, it may take a while to download because they're quite large. 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 - You mean Parler? 
The Witness. No. I meant my attorneys have the documents. 
- Got it. Thank you, Mr. Matze, for the update. 
Mr. Kelly, we can keep in touch about that understanding the privileges. 
Mr.~ I'm sorry, - You're fading there. 
- We can keep in touch on that-- 1 
2 
3 
4 Mr.~ Yes. 
- --and the issues at play. 
Mr.~ Yes. 
- I just want to make it clear that failure to produce the proper 
5 documents, your ability to produce, will be considered a failure to comply with select 
6 committee's subpoena, but seems like Mr. Kelly and I can continue discussing all that. 
7 BY-
8 Q Have you been in discussion with Parler about your compliance with this 
9 subpoena? 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 Mr.~ Same objection. 
The Witness. Fifth. 
Mr.~ Are you directing that to me or John? 
- Mr.Matze. 
Mr.~ Well then, I'm objecting. 
The Witness. Fifth. 
BY-
Q Has anyone at Parler discouraged you from producing documents or 
18 providing information to the select committee today? 
19 
20 Mr.~ Same objection. 
The Witness. Fifth. 52 
21 - So at this point, Mr. Matze has asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege 
22 as a basis to refuse to answer virtually all of the select committee's questions today. 
23 Under these circumstances, we will not close the record on the deposition to let the 
24 Select Committee determine the appropriate course of action to move forward. 
25 Before we go off the record, I would just ask for a five-minute break, could be  53 
1 shorter, but let's go off the record because I need to talk about something with Mr. Kelly 
2 and Mr. Matze. 
3 Let's go off the record at 3:06. 
4 [Discussion off the record.] 
5 BY 
6 Q Pursuant to our conversation, I'm just going to, again, ask Mr. Matze to 
7 invoke the privilege to clarify that he indeed wanted to invoke his Fifth Amendment 
8 privilege for categories of questions that we discussed at the beginning of our deposition. 
9 So I will start, sort of, where we began earlier this afternoon. And I'll ask you, 
10 Mr. Matze, was it your intention to assert the Fifth Amendment in response to all 
11 questions the Committee would ask on the topic of the founding of Parler? 
12 
13 
14 
15 A 
Q 
A 
Q Yes, it is. 
How about your role as CEO of Parler? 
Yes, it is. 
And was it your intention to assert the Fifth Amendment in response to all 
16 questions about the general structure of Parler? 
17 
18 A 
Q Yes, it is. 
And what about all questions in response to the general content moderation 
19 strategies at Parler? Was it your intention to invoke the Fifth Amendment to all 
20 questions in that topic area? 
21 
22 A 
Q Yes, it is. 
And is it your intention to invoke the Fifth Amendment in response to all 
23 questions the committee has about the finances and fund raising practices of Parler? 
24 
25 A 
Q Yes, it is. 
And is it your --was it your intention and is it your intention to raise the Fifth  54 
1 Amendment in response to all questions the committee would ask about Parler's content 
2 moderation posture in 2020? 
3 
4 A 
Q Yes, it is. 
And is it your intention to raise the Fifth Amendment in response to all 
5 questions the committee would ask about Parler's actions during the 2020 election itself? 
6 
7 A 
Q Yes, it is. 
And is it your intention to raise the Fifth Amendment in response to all 
8 questions the committee would ask about any attempts by Parler to limit the use of the 
9 platform by militia extremists, White supremacists, and other violent actors in advance of 
10 the 2020 election? 
11 
12 A 
Q Yes, it is. 
And was it and is it your intention to raise the Fifth Amendment in response 
13 to all questions about Parler's general actions in the aftermath of the 2020 election? 
14 A Yes, it is. Sorry. I had to think about it twice. 
15 Q Thanks. And under the next category, was it your intention to raise the 
16 Fifth Amendment in response to all questions about the reports that we discussed earlier 
17 and Parler's response to them? 
18 
19 A 
Q Yes. Yes, it is. 
And I think the last category this applies to is it and was it your intention to 
20 raise the Fifth Amendment in response to all questions the Committee would ask about 
21 potentially violent or inciteful content seen on Parler in the run-up to January 6th, and 
22 any of Parler's attempts to proactively respond to that content? 
23 
24 
25 A Yes, it is. 
Q Thank you for clarifying all those for the record, Mr. Matze. I appreciate it. 
- So as I noted, we're going to keep the record open so that the  55 
1 chairman will have the opportunity to review any of these objections, and the select 
2 committee can determine the best course of action moving forward. 
3 Before we go off the record, I wanted to pause to see if any of my colleagues, 
4 _, 
had anything they wanted to offer? 
5 Seeing nothing, I wanted to give Mr. Matze or Mr. Kelly the opportunity to say 
6 something. 
Mr.~ We're all set here. 7 
8 - Okay. In that case, the deposition will stand in recess subject to call 
9 of the chair. 
10 [Whereupon, at 3:12 p.m., the deposition was recessed, subject to the call of the 
11 Chair.]
