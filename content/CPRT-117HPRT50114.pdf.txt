Tuesday, October 19, 2021 
U.S. H OUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , 
SELECT COMMITTEE TO INVESTIGATE THE JANUARY 6TH 
ATTACK ON THE UNITED STATES CAPITOL , 
Washington, DC. 
The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 7:37 p.m., in room 
390, Cannon House Office Building, Hon. Bennie G. Thompson (Chairman of the Committee) presiding. 
Present: Representatives Thompson, Cheney, Lofgren, Schiff, 
Aguilar, Murphy, Raskin, Luria, and Kinzinger. 
Chairman T
HOMPSON . A quorum being present, the Select Com-
mittee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol will be in order. 
The Select Committee is meeting this evening to consider a re-
port on a resolution recommending that the House of Representa-tives find Stephen K. Bannon in contempt of Congress for refusal to comply with a subpoena duly issued by the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol. 
Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare the Com-
mittee in recess at any time. 
I will now recognize myself for an opening statement. Let me start by saying that it gives me no joy that I have been 
forced to call this meeting. I think my colleagues feel the same way. 
The expectation of this Committee is that all witnesses will co-
operate with our investigation. Witnesses who have been subpoe-naed have a legal obligation to do so. 
When you think about what we are investigating—a violent at-
tack on the seat of our democracy, perpetrated by fellow citizens on our Constitution, an attempt to stop the certification of an elec-tion—it is shocking to me, shocking that anyone would not do any-thing in their power to assist our investigation. 
So it is a shame that Mr. Bannon has put us in this position. But 
we won’t take no for an answer. We believe Mr. Bannon has infor-mation relevant to our probe, and we will use the tools at our dis-posal to get that information. 
I expect that the House will quickly adopt this referral to the 
Justice Department and that the U.S. attorney will do his duty and prosecute Mr. Bannon for criminal contempt of Congress.  2 
Our goal is simple. We want Mr. Bannon to answer our ques-
tions. We want him to turn over whatever records he possesses that are relevant to the Select Committee’s investigation. 
The issue in front of us today is our ability to do our job. It is 
about fulfilling our responsibilities according to House Resolution 503 to provide the American people answers about what happened on January 6th and help ensure nothing like that day ever hap-pens again. 
We fulfill our responsibilities by discovering the facts behind the 
January 6th attack so that Congress can consider legislation with a full understanding of the activities that led to an attack on Con-gress itself. 
I want to make it clear just how isolated Mr. Bannon is in his 
refusal to cooperate with the Select Committee. We have reached out to dozens of witnesses. We are taking in thousands of pages of records. We are conducting interviews on a steady basis. This is the shoe leather work of conducting a serious, focused investigation. It is not flashy, but it gets results. 
It is essential that we get Mr. Bannon’s factual and complete tes-
timony in order to get a full accounting of the violence of January 6th and its causes. 
Mr. Bannon stands alone in his complete defiance of our sub-
poena. That is not acceptable. No one in this country, no matter how wealthy or how powerful, is above the law. Left unaddressed, this defiance may encourage others to follow Mr. Bannon down the same path. 
For folks watching at home this evening, I want you to think 
about something. What would happen to you if you did what Mr. Bannon is doing? If you were a material witness in a criminal pros-ecution or some other lawsuit, what would happen if you refused to show up? Do you think you would be able to just go about your business? We all know the answer to that. 
There isn’t a different set of rules for Mr. Bannon. He knows 
this. He knows that there are consequences for outright defiance, and he has chosen the path toward criminal contempt by taking this position. 
There are bigger matters at stake. One of the major questions 
the Select Committee is dealing with is whether the rule of law will be able to endure as a pillar of American democracy. After all, we have seen the rule of law put to the test repeatedly in our recent past. 
While we don’t know all of the facts, we do know that there was 
a powerful push to overturn the legitimate results of the 2020 elec-tion. Americans have been and continue to be lied to about that. We know that ultimately there was a violent attack that interfered with the peaceful transfer of power from one President to another. We know that lies about the outcome of that election haven’t gone away. 
Now we have a key witness who is flat-out refusing to comply 
with a congressional subpoena and cooperate with our investiga-tion. The rule of law remains under attack right now. If there is no accountability for these abuses, if there are different sets of rules for different types of people, then our democracy is in serious trouble.  3 
As Chair of this Committee, I won’t allow further harm to the 
rule of law in the course of our work. Mr. Bannon will comply with our investigation or he will face the consequences. 
Maybe he is willing to be a martyr to a disgraceful cause of 
whitewashing what happened on January 6th or demonstrating his complete loyalty to the former President. 
So I want our witnesses to understand something very plainly: 
If you are thinking of following the path Mr. Bannon has gone down, you are on notice that this is what you will face. 
The process we have begun tonight is a grave one. It seldom hap-
pens, and we would rather avoid it altogether. But it is not re-served just for Steve Bannon. If other witnesses defy this Com-mittee, if they fail to cooperate, we will be back in this room with a new report with the names of whoever else mistakenly believes that they are above the law. 
We hope no other witnesses put themselves in the situation Mr. 
Bannon has through his own conduct, but we cannot allow anyone to stand in the way of the Select Committee as we work to get to the facts. The stakes are just too high. We won’t be deterred, we won’t be distracted, and we won’t be delayed. 
I urge my colleagues to support the favorable adoption of this re-
port. 
It is now my pleasure to recognize the distinguished Vice Chair, 
my friend, Ms. Cheney of Wyoming, for any statement she would care to offer. 
Vice Chair C
HENEY . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
On January 6th, a mob breached the security perimeter of our 
Capitol, assaulted and injured more than 140 police officers, en-gaged in hand-to-hand violence over an extended period, and in-vaded and occupied the United States Capitol Building, all in an effort to halt the lawful counting of electoral votes and reverse the results of the 2020 election. 
The day before this all occurred, on January 5th, Mr. Bannon 
publicly professed knowledge that, ‘‘All hell is going to break loose tomorrow.’’ He forecast that the day would be, ‘‘extraordinarily dif-ferent than what most Americans expected.’’ He said to his lis-teners and his viewers, ‘‘So many people said, ‘If I was in a revolu-tion, I would be in Washington.’ ’’ ‘‘Well,’’ he said, ‘‘this is your time in history.’’ 
Based on the Committee’s investigation, it appears that Mr. 
Bannon had substantial advance knowledge of the plans for Janu-ary 6th and likely had an important role in formulating those plans. 
Mr. Bannon was in the ‘‘war room’’ at the Willard on January 
6th. He also appears to have detailed knowledge regarding the President’s efforts to sell millions of Americans the fraud that the election was stolen. 
In the words of many who participated in the January 6th at-
tack, the violence that day was in direct response to President Trump’s repeated claims, from election night through January 6th, that he had won the election. 
The American people are entitled to Mr. Bannon’s first-hand tes-
timony about all of these relevant facts. But as the Chairman noted, Mr. Bannon is refusing to provide it.  4 
* For the text of the report, see Appendix. Preserving our Constitution and the rule of law is a central pur-
pose of this investigation. The plain fact here is that Mr. Bannon has no legal right to ignore the Committee’s lawful subpoena. 
So far, Mr. Bannon’s excuse is that former President Trump 
wishes to invoke some form of executive privilege for a subset of the relevant topics: President Trump’s direct communications with Mr. Bannon regarding the planning for January 6th. 
This information should not be subject to any privilege at all, 
and certainly there is no basis for absolute or unqualified privilege for Presidential communications. 
More important now, there is no conceivably applicable privilege 
that could shield Mr. Bannon from testimony on all of the many other topics identified in this Committee subpoena. 
Because he has categorically refused to appear, we have no 
choice but to seek consequences for Mr. Bannon’s failure to comply. Those consequences are not just important for this investigation. They are important for all congressional investigations. 
Mr. Bannon’s and Mr. Trump’s privilege arguments do, however, 
appear to reveal one thing. They suggest that President Trump was personally involved in the planning and execution of January 6th, and this Committee will get to the bottom of that. 
Let me add one further thought, principally for my Republican 
colleagues. 
We all agree that America is the greatest Nation on the face of 
God’s Earth. Truth, justice, and our Constitution have made Amer-ica great. 
Almost every one of my colleagues knows in their hearts that 
what happened on January 6th was profoundly wrong. You all know that there is no evidence of widespread election fraud suffi-cient to have changed the results of the election. You all know that the Dominion voting machines were not corrupted by a foreign power. You know these claims are false. 
Yet former President Trump repeats them almost daily, and he 
has now urged Republicans not to vote in 2022 and 2024. This is a prescription for national self-destruction. 
I ask my colleagues, please consider the fundamental questions 
of right and wrong here. The American people must know what happened. They must know the truth. All of us who are elected offi-cials must do our duty to prevent the dismantling of the rule of law and to ensure that nothing like that dark day in January ever hap-pens again. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Chairman T
HOMPSON . Pursuant to notice, I now call up the Re-
port on a Resolution Recommending that the House of Representa-tives Find Stephen K. Bannon in Contempt of Congress for Refusal to Comply with a Subpoena Duly Issued by the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol. 
The report was circulated in advance and printed copies are 
available. The clerk shall designate the report. 
[The clerk designated the report.] Chairman T
HOMPSON . Without objection, the report will be con-
sidered as read and open to amendment at any time.*  5 
** For the text of the amendment in the nature of a substitute, see Appendix. 
1Notably, neither of the cases you cite supports the claim that communications between the 
former President and a private citizen may be shielded by either the Presidential communica-tions or deliberative process privilege. Indeed, the case you rely upon to support your Presi-dential communications claim specifically held that the privilege extends only to a President’s closest advisors in the White House. In re Sealed Case (Espy), 121 F.3d 729, 752 (D.C. Cir. 
Continued Chairman T HOMPSON . I recognize myself for the purpose of offer-
ing an amendment in the nature of a substitute now at the desk. 
The clerk shall report the amendment. [The clerk designated the amendment.] Chairman T
HOMPSON . Without objection, the amendment will be 
considered as read and considered base text for purposes of further amendment.** 
Chairman T
HOMPSON . I will now recognize myself to explain the 
amendment. 
Yesterday evening, counsel to Mr. Bannon requested a 1-week 
adjournment of our response to a letter I wrote on October 15th which stated that Mr. Bannon’s willful defiance of the Select Com-mittee’s subpoena would lead to tonight’s hearing. 
Without objection, I include my October 15 letter in the record, 
as well as yesterday’s letter from Robert J. Costello, Mr. Bannon’s attorney. 
[The information follows:] 
LETTER FROM CHAIRMAN BENNIE G. T HOMPSON TO ROBERT J. C OSTELLO  
October 15, 2021 . 
Mr. R OBERT J. C OSTELLO , 
Davidoff Hutcher & Citron LLP, [redacted]. 
DEARMR. COSTELLO : The Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack 
(‘‘Select Committee’’) is in receipt of your October 13, 2021 letter (the ‘‘October 13 letter’’), in which you reassert that your client, Stephen Bannon, will not comply with the September 23, 2021 Subpoena to him for documents and deposition testi-mony (the ‘‘Subpoena’’). As you know, the Subpoena demanded that Mr. Bannon produce documents by October 7, 2021 and appear on October 14, 2021 before the Select Committee to provide deposition testimony on a wide range of issues relating to the January 6, 2021 attack on the United States Capitol, as well as plans to interfere with the count of the 2020 Electoral College results. Mr. Bannon has now willfully failed to both produce a single document and to appear for his scheduled deposition. The Select Committee believes that this willful refusal to comply with the Subpoena constitutes a violation of Federal law. 
As justification for Mr. Bannon’s complete failure to comply with any portion of 
the Subpoena, you continue to rely on ex-President Trump’s stated intention to in-voke executive privilege with respect to Mr. Bannon, and Mr. Trump’s purported re-quest that Mr. Bannon not produce documents to or testify before the Select Com-mittee. As was explained in the Select Committee’s October 8, 2021 letter (at-tached), the former President has not communicated any such assertion of privilege, whether formally or informally, to the Select Committee. Moreover, we believe that any such assertion of privilege—should it be made by the former President—will not prevent the Select Committee from lawfully obtaining the information it seeks. 
Further, your letter makes no attempt to justify Mr. Bannon’s failure to comply 
with the Subpoena’s demand for documents and testimony on a range of subjects 
that do not involve communications with the former President. As is clear from the Subpoena and accompanying letter, and as underscored in the Select Committee’s October 8, 2021 response letter, the Select Committee seeks documents and testi-mony on numerous other matters, including Mr. Bannon’s communications with Members of Congress, Presidential campaign representatives, and other private par-ties concerning the events of January 6, 2021, that could not conceivably be barred by a privilege claim. 
Moreover, even if the Select Committee were inclined to accept the unsupported 
premise that executive privilege reaches communications that the Select Committee seeks to examine between President Trump and Mr. Bannon,
1Mr. Bannon does not  6 
1997). See also Committee on the Judiciary v. Miers, 558 F. Supp. 2d 53, 100 (D.D.C. 2008) 
(privilege claimants acknowledged that executive privilege applies only to ‘‘a very small cadre of senior advisors’’). 
2The McGahn court followed Committee on the Judiciary v. Miers, 558 F. Supp.2d 53, 108 
(D.D.C. 2008), which reached the same conclusion 13 years ago. McGahn, 415 F. Supp. 3d at 
202–03 (‘‘this Court finds that the Miers court rightly determined not only that the principle 
of absolute testimonial immunity for senior-level Presidential aides has no foundation in law, but also that such a proposition conflicts with key tenets of our constitutional order’’). enjoy any form of absolute immunity from testifying or producing documents in re-
sponse to a congressional subpoena. Your citation to Committee on Judiciary v. 
McGahn, 415 F. Supp. 3d 148 (D.D.C. 2019) actually supports the Select Committee, 
not your client. In McGahn, the district court unequivocally held that even senior 
White House aides are not entitled to absolute immunity from testifying in response to a congressional subpoena. Id. at 214 (‘‘To make the point as plain as possible, 
it is clear to this Cour t... that, with respect to senior-level Presidential aides, ab-
solute immunity from compelled congressional process simply does not exist.’’).
2In-
deed, the footnote in McGahn that you selectively quote makes clear that a Presi-
dent lacks legal authority to order an aide not to appear before Congress based on a claim of executive privilege. See Id. at 213, n. 34 (‘‘But the invocation of the privi-
lege by a testifying aide is an order of magnitude different than DOJ’s current claim that the President essentially owns the entirety of a senior-level aide’s testimony 
such that the White House can order the individual not to appear before Congress at all.’’ (Emphasis in original)). 
Accordingly, the Select Committee views Mr. Bannon’s failure to produce docu-
ments by the October 7, 2021 deadline as willful non-compliance with the Subpoena. Mr. Bannon has persisted in his refusal to produce any documents to the Select Committee, and he has failed to provide a privilege log identifying specific, asserted privileges. Mr. Bannon has now further compounded his non-compliance by refusing to appear on October 14, 2021 at the Select Committee deposition to which he was summoned to provide testimony. The Select Committee will therefore be meeting on Tuesday, October 19, 2021 to consider invoking the contempt of Congress procedures set forth in 2 U.S.C. §§192, 194. 
If Mr. Bannon believes that there are any additional issues relating to his non- 
compliance with the Subpoena that have not been addressed, please submit them in writing to the Select Committee by 6 o’clock p.m. E.S.T. on Monday, October 18, 2021 for the Select Committee’s consideration in its deliberations. 
Sincerely, 
B

Re: Ihe SubQoena for Stephen K. Bannon dated September 23 2021 
Dear Congress man Thompson : 
We write on behalf of Stephen Bannon. We have just been advised of the 
filing of a lawsuit in federal court for lhe District of Columbia entitled Donald J. Trump v. 
Bennie Thompson, et al., 21-Civ-02769 (D.D.C. 2021). In light of this late filing, we 
respectfully request a one-week adjournment of our response to your latest letter so that 
we might thoughtfully assess the impact of this pending litigation. 
Very truly yours. 
Isl Robert J. Costello 
RJC/nc  8 
Chairman T HOMPSON . Mr. Bannon’s attorney said they needed 
time to, ‘‘assess the Select Committee’s request in light of litigation filed by former President Trump in the District of Columbia Dis-trict Court yesterday.’’ However, the former President’s lawsuit is immaterial to Mr. Bannon’s defiance of our lawful subpoena. I made that clear in a letter to Mr. Costello this morning. 
Without objection, I include my full letter in the record. [The information follows:] 
LETTER FROM CHAIRMAN BENNIE G. T HOMPSON TO ROBERT J. C OSTELLO  
October 19, 2021 . 
Mr. R OBERT J. C OSTELLO , 
Davidoff Hutcher & Citron LLP, [redacted]. 
DEAR MR. COSTELLO : I write yet again to urge your client Stephen K. Bannon to 
change course and comply with the September 23, 2021, subpoena from the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol (‘‘Se-lect Committee’’). 
As explained in our prior correspondence, your stated reasons for Mr. Bannon’s 
flat refusal to provide documents and appear at a deposition have no legal basis or support. Because of Mr. Bannon’s continued refusal to comply with the subpoena, the Select Committee has unanimously voted to recommend that the House of Rep-resentatives find Mr. Bannon to be in contempt of Congress. The detailed basis for that recommendation is contained in the Select Committee’s report, a copy of which is available at the following link: https://docs.house.gov/Committee/Calendar/ 
ByEvent.aspx?EventID=114156. Should the House of Representatives agree with 
that recommendation, the Speaker of the House will certify the relevant statement of facts to the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia, ‘‘whose duty it shall be to bring the matter before the grand jury for its action.’’ See 2 U.S.C. § 194. 
Additionally, President Biden’s recently communicated views relating to your cli-
ent’s reliance on executive privilege as a basis for his non-compliance provide fur-ther support for the Select Committee’s position. As you know, in its October 18, 2021, letter, the Office of the White House Counsel concluded that ‘‘at this point we are not aware of any basis for [Mr. Bannon’s] refusal to appear for a deposition.’’ The letter further noted that President Biden has ‘‘already determined that an as-sertion of executive privilege is not in the public interest, and therefore is not justi-fied, with respect to certain subjects within the purview of the Select Committee.’’ In short, the current President’s statements should remove any doubt regarding the inappropriateness of Mr. Bannon’s reliance on assertions of executive privilege as grounds for his noncompliance with the subpoena. Mr. Bannon has no basis in law to continue to defy the appropriate use of congressional subpoena authority. 
These developments underscore the folly of any continuing defiance of the Select 
Committee subpoena by Mr. Bannon. The Select Committee remains focused on ex-peditiously obtaining the testimony and documents necessary to meet our respon-sibilities and we continue to expect immediate compliance by Mr. Bannon. Should Mr. Bannon choose to change his posture, please notify Select Committee staff [re-dacted]. 
Sincerely, 
B
ENNIE G. T HOMPSON , 
Chairman. 
Chairman T HOMPSON . Furthermore, the White House yesterday 
issued a letter to Mr. Bannon’s attorney stating, ‘‘We are not aware of any basis for your client’s refusal to appear for a deposition,’’ be-fore the Select Committee, and further said that, ‘‘President Biden has already determined that an assertion of executive privilege is not in the public interest and, therefore, is not justified with re-spect to certain subjects within the purview of the Select Com-mittee.’’ 
Without objection, I include the full White House letter in the 
record.  9

On January 6, 2021, a .,.iolent mob breached the 98CUrity perim• 
eter of the United Stat.es Capit.ol, assaulted and injured ecores of 
rv~i~a~ffi=r:~d~~it h=t~vhade~ ~~1d":CUW:,~tl,th: c~;~ 
building, all in an effort to ha.Jt the lawful oounting of elect.oral 
votes and reverse the results of the 2020 election. ln the words of 
many of those who participated in the violence, the attack was a ~:~n.:in~ !!19:JecS:o~°:i1:~ ~Jh:;f::i~~':Jn~ili~~ih 
January 6, 2021-that the 2020 election had been stolen by oor• 
rupted voting machines, widespread fraud, and otheni..;se. 
In response, the House adopted House Resolution 503 on June 
30, 2021, establishing the Select Committee to lnvestigat.e the Jan• 
uary 6th Attack on the United States Capit.ol (hereinafter referred 
to as the "'Select Committee"). 
The Select Committee is investigating the facts, circumstances, 
and causes of the January 6th attack and issues relating t:o the 
peaceful transfer of power, in order t.o identify how the events of 
January 6th were planned, what actions and statements motivat:ed 
and contributed t.o the attack on the Capitol, how the violent riot 
that day was coordinated with a political and public relations strat­
egy t.o re\'erse the election out.come, and why Capitol security was 
insufficient t.o address what occurred. The Selec.t Committee Y.ill 
evaluate all facets of these issues. c.reate a public record of what 
occurred, and recommend to the House, and its rele\'ant commit­tees, oorrect.ive laws, policies, procedures, ru.Jes, or regulations. 
Acoording to many published reports, and his own public state­
ments, Stephen K. Bannon had specific knowledge about the events 
planned for January 6th before they oocurred. He said on his Janu4 
ary 5th pod.casts, for example:  16 
Mr. Bannon appears to have had multiple roles relevant to this 
in\'es~ation, including his role in constructing and participating in the stop the steal" public relations effort that motivated the at­
tack, his efforts t:o plan political and other activity in advance of 
January 6th, and his participation in the e\'ents of that day from 
a .. war room"' organized at the Willard Int:erContinent.al Wash­
ington O.C. Hotel (the ''Willard Hotel"). Although he was a privat:e 
citizen not employed by the Whit:e House at the time, he reportedly 
spoke with Mr. Trump direct.Jy regarding the plans for Januarx 6th 
on at least one occasion. In short, Mr. Bannon appears to have 
~:!ec;fc:O m~;j~a:,~~~1Ue!r ~hee::ht 1,:th:J !:im8o~t ~ 
garding his actions. The Select Committee expects that such testi•

aocept.ed service on Mr. Bannon's behalf on September 24, 2021.8 
The subpoena required that Mr. Bannon produce responsive docu4 
ments not lat.er than Oct.ober 7, 2021, and that Mr. Bannon appear 
for a deposition on October 14, 2021. Subsequent communications 
between counsel for Mr. Bannon and Chairma n Tl-tO.MVSON, how4 
ever, failed to reach any accommodation for Mr. Bannon's appear4 
ance for testimony or production of doc:-uments. Indeed, counsel for 
Mr. Bannon on October 7, 2021, flatly stated that Mr. Bannon would not produce any documents or appear at the scheduled depo­
sition, as ordered by the lawful subpoena. Although Mr. Bannon's 
counsel referenced "'ague claims of executive privilege purporte d.Jy

Pursuant to House rule XI and House Resolution 503, the Select 
Committee is authorized "'to require, by subpoena or otherwise, the 
attendance and t.estimony of suc.h witnesses and the productio n of

A Th"-Sf'.lttt Commiftf'.i' ~ks informatfon from Mr. Bannon ~ntn:zl 
to its investigative purposes 
Mr. Bennon's testimony and document production are critical to 
the Select Committee's in,,-estigation. Among other topics, the Se­
lect Committee seeks facts that explain why the e,,-ents of January 
6th turned violent. Stateme nts publicly made by Mr-. Bannon on 
January 5, 2021, suggest that he had 90me foreknowledge about 
extreme events that would oocur the next day. Mr. Bannon noted 
:~i~h:?~;~s t~sa!d!:t0:~·u;a: ~~tnt: ·:3~t~ro;*~fe

rected to investigate those fads, which include "'the influencing fac­
tors that fomented such an attack.• And after making public state­
ments on January 5th like those quoted above, Mr. Bannon is 
obliged by law to comply with the reasonable requests of the Select 
Committee through its subpoena. [f any witness so dose to the 
event.s leading up to the January 6th att.ai:::k could decline to pro­
vide information to the Select Committee, Congress would be se­
verely hamstrung in its ability to exercise its constitutio nal powers

Mr. Bannon was the Chief Executive Offioer of M.r. Trump's 2016 
presidential campaisn: and served as then-President Trump's chief strategist, a Whit.e House position, for 8 months in 2017.16 Mr.  19 
Trump fired. Mr. Bannon in August 2017,17 and Mr. Bannon did

involved in media and politics. In October 2019, Mr. Bannon began 
a radio show and podcast focused on rallying supporten. of Mr. 
Trump in support of various causes and i.ssues.1S According to one 
report, before the eloc:tion even occurred in 20'20, Mr. Bannon made 
public efforts to e:xplain "his belief that the Democrats are plotting 
lo steal the 2020 eleetion."1!1 One account of conversa tions involv­
ing Mr. Bannon (and Mr. Trump) prior to January 6th describes 
Mi-. Bannon as encouraging Mr. Trump to "focus on January 6th" 
and articulating a plan to have millions of Americans consider Mr. 
Biden an illegitimate President.20 That same reporting suggests 
that Mr. Bannon was in frequent contact with the Whit.e House in 
late.December and early.January and spoke direct!}' with the

Pence to assist in O\'erturning the results of the 2020 eloc:tion.22 
Mr. Bannon was rep:>rtedly encouraging President Trump's sup­
p:>rters to take dramatic action. According to one report, imme­
diately aft.er the November ard eloc:tion, Mr. Bannon began pro­
moting false conspiracy claims that the election had been stolen 
and referred to the election as "'a mass fraud. "23 
The day before the January 6th attack on the Capitol, Mr. 
Bannon predicted that '"All hell is going to break loose tomorrow."'24 
He told the li.st.eners of his radio show:

quired by the subpotma 43 
At 2:05 p.m. on October 15, 2021, Chairman TMOYPSON sent a. 
letter to Mr. Costello noting that Mr. Bannon had not e•;en at­
tempted to provide the Select Committee any explanat-ion for refus­
ing to comply with the Select Committee's demand for documents 
and testimony on a range of subjects that do not in\'olve eommu4 
nications ·with the former PresidenL The Chairman also reiterat.ed 
that Mr. Bannon does not enjoy absolute immunity from testifying 
before the Select Committ.ee. The Chairman reminded Mr. Costello that the Select Committ:ee views Mr. Bannon's conduct as willful 
non~mplianoe with the subpoena. He notified Mr. Costello that, 
aocordingly, the Select Committ:ee would meet on October 19, 2021, 
to consider a criminal cont.empt referral for i\ir. Bannon, and in­
vited Mr. Costello t.o submit any written materials he believed the 
Select Committee should oonsider in its deliberations on this refer­
ral.

Mr. Bannon's conduct in res~nae to the Select Committee's sub­

provisions. 
I. Executhie privilege has not been im.:oked 
Mr. Trump has had no communication with the Select Com­
mittee. In an October 7th Jett.er to the Select Committee, Mr. 
Bannon's attorney referred to purported oorresponde nce from Mr. 
Trump's attorney, Justin Clark, in which A-tr. Clark asserted that. 
the Select Committ:ee subpoena seeks informatio n that is '"poten­

No oolorable claim of executive privilege oould possibly be made 
with respect to documents or testimony related to these and other 
matters sought by the subpoena, or any otlier topics that were not 
oonnected to official decisionmaking by the President. 
3. Mr. Bannon ia not entitled to absolute immunity 
Mr. Bannon has refused to provide any responsive documents or 
appear for a deposition based on his asserted reliance on Mr. 
?n~.p~~~ ii:~~~i~~!;.~!up t;_r~~l!~d· ~-~~·ei?~~~ 
t::~n!.o!fd ~~u:e~t.sm~~u~~a!mw;h~ ~:m~~;tero:-e ~~ 
Select Committee. The law is dear that even senior White House a.ides who advise 
the President on official government business are not immune from 
oompelled oongressio na.l process.s.. To the extent there has been a  27 
14 
formal invocation of executive privilege by the Office of the Presi4 
dent, and in the unlikely e••ent that testimony bv Mr. Bannon re­lates t.o information covered by that privilege, Mr. Bannon was 
nonetheless required to appear before the Select Committee to p~ 
vide testimony and im·oke executive privilege where appropriate. lf 
there are responsi\'e doc-ument.s that Mr. Bannon claims include 
privileged information, he was required t:o provide U,e Select Com4 
mittee with a privilege log that "identifies and describes the mate­
rial in a manner 'sufficient t:o enable resolution of any privilese 
claim.s.''°o& Mr. Bannon did neither. He should be held in contempt. 
D. Precedent supports the &led Committee's pos.ition to prooeed 
wiJh holding Mr. Bannon in cont.empt 
An individual who fails or refuses to comply with a House sul> 
poena may be cited for oontempt of Congress .66 Pursuant to 2 
U.S.C. § 19"2, the willful refu.saJ t.o oomply with a congressional sub­
poena is punishable by a fine of up to $100,000 and imprisonment 
for up to 1 year.67 A committee may \·ote to seek a contempt cita• 
t-ion against a recalcitrant witness. This action is then reported to 
the House. lf a resolutio n to that end is adopt.ed by the House, the 
matter is referred to a U.S. Attorney, who has a duty t.o refer the 
matter to a grand jury for an indictment.68 
In his October 8th letter to Mr. Bannon's counsel, the Chairman 
of tho Select Committee o.dvioc-d ~fr. 80.nnon tho.t hi~ doimo of ex 
ecutive privilege were not well-founded and did not absolve him of 
his obligation to produce documents and t.estif)• in deposition. The 
Chairman made clear that the Select Committee expected Mr. 
Bannon to appear for his scheduled deposition on October 14th and 
produce the requested documents at. that time. The Chairman 
warned Mr. Bannon that his continued non-compliance would put 
him in jeopardy of a vote to refer him to the House to consider a 
criminal contempt referral. Mr. Bannon's failure to appear for dep­
osition or produce responsive documents in the face of this clear ad• 
visement and warning by the Chairman constitutes a willful failure 
to oomply with the subpoena.

~.rc:~:k~~~~~g~~: fa't~h~S: d~~~n~:dj~i,°3:!s:C~ffue~ 
over an extended period, and invaded and ooc.upied the Capitol

many of those who participated in the violence, the attack was a

Aocording t:o many published reports. and hjs own public state­
ments, Stephen K. Bannon harl specific knowledge about the events 
planned for January 6th before they ooc-urred.. He said on his Janu­
ary 5th podcasts, for example: 
Mr. Bannon appears to ha,;e had multiple roles relevant to tbis 
investigation, including his role in constructing and participating 
in the "stop the steal" public relations effort that motivated the at­
tack, his efforts t:o plan political and other activity in advance of 
January 6th, and his participation in the events of that day from 
a "war room" organized at the Willard lnterContinentaJ Wash­
ington O.C. Hotel (the ''Willard Hotel"). Although he was a private 
citizen not employed by the White House at the time, he reportedly 
spoke with Mr. Trump direct!J regarding the plans for January 6th 
on at least one occasion. In short, 1'.lr. Bannon appears to have 
played a multi-faceted role in the e\'ents of January 6th, and the 
American people are entitled to hear his 6rst-hand testimony re­
garding his actions. The Select Committee expects that such testi4 
fo~J~":P~u1: :dOC::J;e~!~~ to its report and recommendations 
On September 23, 2021, Chainnan BENNIE G. 'fl-l01lPSON signed 
a subpoena for doc-uments and t.estimony and transmitted it along 
with a oover letter and schedule to counsel for Mr. Bannon. who 
accepted service on Mr. Ban.r.on's behalf on September 24, 2021.3 
The subpoena required that Mr. Bannon produce responsive docu4 
ments not later than October 7, 2021, and that Mr. Bannon appear 
for a depOEiition on October 14, 2021. Subsequent oommunkat-ions 
between counsel for Mr. Bannon and Chairman THOMPSON, how4 
ever, failed to reach any accommodation for Mr. Bannon's appear4 
ance for testimony or production of documents. Indeed, counsel for 
Mr. Bannon on October 7, 2021, flatly stated that Mr. Bannon 
would not produce any documents or appear at the scheduled depo­
sition, as ordered by the lawful subpoena. Although Mr. Bannon's 
oounsel referenood ,•ague claims of executive privilege purportedly 
relayed by the former President, no such claims have been pre-
~~~i bthetht[!~~!:;;:!;1~s ~o~rid:{~£°~ ~~t~~:n~!t!'i~ 
not bar any of its requests, tl:ere is no conceivable executive pri\'14 
lege claim that could bar aU of the Selec.t Committee's requests or 
justify Mr. Bannon's flat refusal to appear for the required deposi4 
:~~:J~!i::Jb;s ~.1:~n~n~~~~~:ra "nd !!~~=r ~ate3,~ 
Select Committee expected---e; the law demands-that Mr. Bannon 
appear before the Select Committee at his depo6ition and raise any 
privilege or other concerns regarding specific questions on the 
record of that prooeeding.s

A Th.e Select Committee seeks information from Mr. Bannon. central 
to its im .. -estigati~,,e purposes

the Select Committee's investigatio n. Among other t.opics, the Se­
lect Committee seeks fads that explain why the events of January 
6th turned ..,ioJenL Statements publicly made by Mr. Bannon on 
January 5, 2021, sugr;est that he had some foreknowledge about

Congress, through the Select Committee, is entitled t.o discover 
facts conoeming the activities leading up to the violence on Janu­
ary 6th. Under House Resolution 503, the Select Committee is di­rect:ed t:o investigate those facts, which include "'the influencing fac­
t.ors that fomented such an attack."' And after making public state­
ments on January 5th like those quoted above, Mr. Bannon is 
obliged by law to comply with the reasonable requests of the Select 
Committee through its subpoena. lf any witness so dose to the 
events leading up to the January 6th attack could decline to p~ 
vide information to the Select Committee, Congress would be se­
verely hamstrung in its abihty to exercise its constitutional powers 
with highly relevant information informing its choioes. Information 
in Mr. Bannon's possession is essential to putting other witnesses' 
testimony and productio ns into appropriate context and to ensuring 
the Selec.t Committee can fulJy and expeditiously complete its work.

On October 7, 2021, at 10 a.m., at the designated location identi­
fied in the subpoena, Mr. Bannon faiJed to appear and produoe doc­
uments. Instead, over 7 hours later, Mr. Costello sent a Jett.er to 
Chairman 1'1-to.MPSON .,,;a emaiJ at 5:04 p.m. reinforcing Mr. 
Ba.nnon's refusal to comply. 
Mr. Costello's retter cited an Oc.tober 6, 2021, letter from former 
President Trump's counsel Justin Clark to Mr. Costello that pur­
portedJy instructed Mr. Bannon to "invoke any immunities and 
privileges he ma..y have from compelled t.estimony," "not produce 
any documents concerning privileged material." and "not provide 
any testimony ooncemin_g privileged materia JJ.)"36 Mr. Costello's 
Jett.er then asserted that Mr. Bannon was "legally unable to com­
ply," v.i.th the su'bpoena for "documents or testimony, .. claiming t.o

pected Mr. Bannon to appear at the deposition on October 14th and 
state on the record any privilege concerns raised by specific qu~

The Chairman concluded b y saying that Mr. Bannon was there­
fore not in compliance with the Chairman's duly issued subpoena 
for documents, and that the Select Commjttee would view refusal 
to produce documents and refusal t.o appear at. the Oct.ober 14th 
depositio n as willful non<omphance with the subpoena. The Chair­
man warned that this willful non<ampliance would put Mr. 
Bannon in jeopardy of a vot.e t.o re.fer him t.o the House to consider

On that call, Mr. Costello represented to the Select Committee 
that he had asked Mr. Trump's counsel t.o identify, with specificity, 
oommunications for which executive privilege would apply. Later 
that day, Mr. Costello transmitted a response to Chairma n TH01rP­
soN's October 8, 2021, letter. ln that letter, Mr. Costello re.iterated 
hjs position that Mr. Bannon's refusal to oomply with the Select 
Committee subpoena was based on the former President's "execu­
tive and other privileges."" 1 Mr. Costello claimed that President 
Trump's counsel had "exercisfed J his executive privilege" and "di• 
rect.ed Mr. Bannon not to produce documents or testify until the 
issue of executive privilege is resol\'ecl ."◄.2: He further stated that 
Mr. Bannon would refuse to produce any documents or appear for

On October 14, 2021, at 10 a.m., Mr. Bannon failed to appear at 
the designated location t.o provide testimony relevant t.o the Select 
Committee's inquiry in response t.o questions posed, as was ~ 
quired by the subpoena. 43 
At 2:05 p.m. on October 15, 2021, Chairman 'T'HOMPSON sent a 
Jett.er t.o Mr. Costello noting that Mr. Bannon had not even at.­
tempt:ed to provide the Select Committee any explanation for refus­
ing to comply with the Select Committee's demand for documents 
and testimony on a range of subjects that do not in\•olve commu• 
nk-ations with the former President. The Chairman also reiterat:ed that Mr. Bannon does not enjoy absolute immunity from testifying 
before the Select Committee. The Chairman reminded Mr. Costello that the Select Committee views Mr. Bannon's conduct as willful 
non-compliance with the subpoena. He notified Mr. Costello tha~ aocording:ly, the Select Committee would meet on October 19, 2021, 
to consider a criminal cont.empt referral for Mr. Bannon, and in­vited M.r. Costello to submit any writt.en mat.erials he believed tl,e 
Select Committee should consider in its deliberations on this refer­
ral. 
On October 18, 2021, Mr. Costello wrote Chairman ThomJ)60n re­

serted that M.r. Bannon's testimony would reveal oommunicat.ions 
in\'olving the President or members of his immediate White House

Moreover, the matters under review by the Select Committee con­
cern efforts to overb..irn legitimate election results and an attack on 
our democratic institution.s. Communications regarding these sub­
jects (or any other matter related lo the presidential campaign), by 
definition, would not constitute advice on "official go•.-ernment mat­
tersn that could be shielded by executi,.•e privilege. ln any e\'ent, 
any confidentia lity interest in such communications would be far 
outweighed by the oveui,ght needs for this information that are at. 
stake in the Select Committee's investigation. 
ln sum: In this instance. there is no reasonable argument that. 
1'.fr. Bannon's communications with the President regarding Janu­
ary 6th are the type of matters on which privilege can be asserted. 
Al80, the Select Committee is confident th.at no executh-e privilege 
assertion would bar Mr. Bannon's testimony regarding his rommu-

No oolorab!e claim of executive privilege oould possibly be made 
with respect t.o documents or testimony related t.o these and other 
matters sought by the subpoena, or any other topics that were not 
oonnect.ed t.o nfficial decisionmaking by the President.

Mr. Banno:1 has refused to provide any responsi,·e documents or

if Mr. Trump had invoked executive privilege , and even if certain 
testimony or documents would fall within that privilege, Mr. 
Bannon would not be immune from oompelled testimony before the 
Select Committee. 
The law is elear that even senior White House aides who advise 
the President on official government business are not immune from 
oompelled congressional process.&'7 To the extent there has been a 
fonnal invocation of executive privilege by the Office of the Presi­
dent, and in the unlikely event th.at testimony by Mr. Bannon ~

there are responsive documents that Mr. Bannon daims include 
privileged information, he was required to provide the Selec.t Com­
mittee with a privilege log that "identifies and describes the mate­
rial in a manner 'sufficient to enable resolution of any privilege 
claims."'66 Mr. Bannon did neither. He should be held in oontempt. 
D. Precedent supports the Select Committee's position to proceed 
wUh holding Mr. Bannon in contempt

ln his October 8th Jett.er to Mr. Bannon's counsel, the Chairman 
of the Select Committee advised Mr. Bannon that his claims of ex­
ecutive privilege were not well-founded and did not absolve him of 
his obligation to produce documents and testif)' in deposition. The 
Chairman made clear that the Select Committee expected l\lr. 
Bannon to appear for his scheduled deposition on Oct<.,er 14th and 
produce the requested documents at that time. The Chairman 
warned Mr. Bannon that his continued non~mpliance would put
