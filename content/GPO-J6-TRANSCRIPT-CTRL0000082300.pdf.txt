3 Mr. - It's 1:04 p.m. Let's please go on the record. 
Good afternoon. This is a deposition conducted by the House Select Committee 
4 to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol pursuant to House 3 
5 resolution 503. At this time, I would ask the witness to please state and spell your name 
6 for the record. 
7 
8 The Witness. My name is Salvatore Greco. It's S-a-1-v-a-t-o-r-e and G-r-e-c-o. 
Mr.- Thank you, Mr. Greco. And thank you for joining us. If you could 
9 please raise your right hand, the official reporter will swear you in for the deposition. 
10 The Reporter. Do you solemnly declare and affirm under the penalty of perjury 
11 that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing 
12 but the truth? 
The Witness. I do. 13 
14 Mr. - Mr. Greco, this will be a staff-led deposition, but members of the 
15 select committee may choose to join and ask questions, but as for now, I anticipate the 
16 questions will be asked by me, and my name is I'm a senior investigative 
17 counsel on the staff of the select committee. 
18 Joining me on Webex are several members of the staff, but no other attorneys. 
19 At this time, I'll just go through some basic ground rules of the deposition, and the first is 
20 to say that we'll follow the House's deposition rules, under which you are permitted to 
21 have an attorney with you. 
22 Mr. Parrotta, if you could please, just announce yourself and spell your name for 
23 the record. 
24 Mr. Parrotta. Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Patrick Parrotta. The 
25 spelling of my last name is P-a-r-r-o-t-t-a. Good afternoon.  4 
1 Mr.- Thank you, Mr. Parrotta. 
2 Now, we provided you, Mr. Greco and Mr. Parrotta, with the House's deposition 
3 rules as part of the subpoena to Mr. Greco, and under those rules, you would've seen 
4 that neither committee members nor staff may discuss the substance of your testimony, 
5 Mr. Greco, that you provide today unless the committee approves release. And we will 
6 give you an opportunity to review the transcript with your attorney before it is released if 
7 it is at all, but before we begin, as I said, I'll go over just a few more ground rules. 
8 As you now have seen, there's an official reporter who's transcribing today's 
9 discussion. The reporter is also joining us by Webex. Please wait until each question is 
10 asked before you begin your answer, and I'll wait for you to finish your answer before I 
11 ask my next question. 
12 The reporter can't record nonverbal responses, such as shaking your head or 
13 nodding your head, so it's important to answer each question with a verbal response. 
14 And, if for whatever reason, we need to have you spell something, it's simply so the 
15 record is clear. So excuse me on the front end if we have to do that. 
16 All we're asking is for you to provide complete answers based on your best 
17 recollection. If the question is not clear, just ask me, and I'll rephrase as best I can. 
18 And, if you don't know the answer, simply say so. 
19 Now, you may refuse to answer a question to preserve a privilege recognized by 
20 the select committee. And, if you refuse to answer a question based on a privilege, 
21 staff, that is myself, may either seek a ruling from the chairman of the select committee 
22 on the objection or proceed with the deposition and seek a ruling from the chairman at a 
23 later date. 
24 If at whatever time we raise it to the chairman he overrules an objection, you 
25 would be required to answer the question.  1 I'll also want to remind you as we do all witnesses that it is unlawful to 
2 deliberately provide false information to Congress. And, since this deposition is under 
3 oath, providing false information could result in criminal penalties to include for perjury 
4 and/or providing false statements. 
5 So is all of that clear on the front end? 
6 
7 
8 
9 The Witness. Yes. 
EXAMINATION 
Q Okay. Now, last week and then before we started the deposition today, 5 
10 your counsel, Mr. Parrotta, informed me of certain things about your position with regard 
11 to the subpoena. The first is that you did receive the subpoena and provided certain 
12 documents. Is that right Mr. Greco? 
13 
14 A 
Q Correct. 
All right. So what we have in our possession provided by Mr. Parrotta are 
15 phone records of yours during the months at issue covering roughly November of 2020 to 
16 January of 2021. Is that right? 
17 
18 A 
Q Correct. 
Okay. You might need to lean forward and speak up just a bit so we can 
19 hear you. I also understand from Mr. Parrotta that it's your intention to with regard to 
20 what I'll call substantive questions about January 6th and the events around it to invoke 
21 your right not to answer under the Fifth Amendment. Is that generally accurate? 
22 
23 A 
Q Correct. 
Okay. But be that as it may, we are going to proceed with the questions 
24 relevant to the select committee's investigation this afternoon with the hope that you will 
25 answer.  6 
1 Now, the Fifth Amendment affords a person the right to refuse to answer a 
2 question if they have a reasonable belief that the answer would tend to incriminate them. 
3 Do you understand that? 
4 
5 A 
Q Correct. 
It does not afford a person the right to refuse to answer a question simply 
6 because they would prefer not to answer it. Do you understand that? 
7 
8 A 
Q Yes. 
Mr. Greco, regarding the documents, I just want to make sure I understand. 
9 There were several categories of requests within the subpoena for documents, you know, 
10 relevant to what the select committee is investigating and, again, appreciating that you 
11 provided the phone records. 
12 Did you conduct a search with the assistance of your attorney to see if you had 
13 any other responsive documents? 
14 
15 A 
Q Yes. 
Okay. And is it correct that you didn't find anything else responsive other 
16 than the phone records? 
17 
18 A Yes. 
Mr. Parrotta. Just so there's no ambiguity of the things that we searched for 
19 you, we only had phone records, correct? 
20 
21 
22 The Witness. Yeah. 
BYMR.-: 
Q And I'm not asking about substance, but just as a one aspect would be 
23 whether or not you looked to see if you had text messages with people such as Roger 
24 Stone or Kristin Davis, again, not asking substance, but did you check to see if you had any 
25 of those from the time period we're looking at?  1 
2 
3 
4 A Yes. 
Q Okay. And so you didn't find anything of that sort? 
A No, not on my phone, no. 
Q Okay. So I'll start with what I'll call the background questions, which I 
5 understand you'll answer, not substantive about the events, but how old are you, Mr. 
6 Greco?

15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 A l'm40. 
Q And what State do you reside in? 
A New York. 
Q How are you employed? 
A Police officer. 
Q With what police department? 
A NYPD. 
Q How long have you been with NYPD? 
A Approximately 14 years. 
Q And the rank --your current rank is officer? 
A Correct. 
Q Do you know Roger Stone? 
A Yes. 
Q And how long have you known Mr. Stone for? 
A Since 2018. 
Q And how did you first meet him in 2018? 
Mr. Parrotta. Answer those. 
The Witness. Off of --I actually met him --I spoke to him on lnstagram. He 
25 actually direct messaged me. 7  1 
2 
3 Q 
A BYMR.-
What was in response to, or did he say why he was reaching out to you? 
It was more of --I liked one of his pictures, and I was --there were --I 
4 might've made a good positive comment on his picture, and then, after a couple of his 
5 posts, I guess, over a few days, then he just direct messaged me out of nowhere. 
6 Q And, since 2018 and just at a high level, how would you characterize your 
7 relationship with Mr. Stone? 
8 A We're --we're friends. I'm friends with the family, but it's --it's --that's a 
9 pretty good definition of how our relationship is. 
10 Q 
11 his family? 
12 
13 
14 
15 A 
Q 
A 
Q When you say "friends of the family," are you talking about Mr. Stone and 
Correct. 
Now, have you ever worked for Roger Stone? 
No. 
Now, it's been reported publicly that, you know, the NYPD initiated 
16 disciplinary proceedings against you with respect to your having been in Washington, 
17 D.C., with Mr. Stone on January 5th and 6th of 2021, and the reporting is that the 8 
18 proceedings were instituted, both because you were alleged to have provided security for 
19 Mr. Stone and also for associating with Mr. Stone and Kristin Davis, who have previously 
20 been convicted of felonies. 
21 So, just as a factual matter, is it right that the disciplinary proceedings were 
22 instituted by the NYPD? 
23 Mr. Parrotta. -am I allowed to speak to him one second? 
24 
25 Mr. - Absolutely. 
Mr. Parrotta. Was there a disciplinary proceeding by the NYPD because of your  1 association with Mr. Stone? 
2 
3 The Witness. Correct. Yes. 
BYMR.-
4 Q Now, it's been reported publicly that you testified during those disciplinary 
5 proceedings. Is that right as a factual matter that you testified? 
6 A Yes. 
7 Q It's also been reported that, during your testimony, you discussed your 
8 relationship with Mr. Stone. Is that right just as a general matter, how you know him 
9 and what that's been like over the few years? 
10 
11 A Yes. 
Q It's also been reported that you discussed the events of January 5th and 6th 
12 of 2021 in Washington, D.C., during your testimony. Is that correct that you did that? 
13 
14 
15 
16 A Yeah. 
Mr. Parrotta. Okay. He replied yes. 
BYMR.-
Q Okay. If you could say that Mr. Greco, so we could hear. Is that true that 
17 you testified about that in your testimony? 
18 
19 A Yes. 
Q All right. Now, it's been reported also that, during your testimony about 
20 the events of January 5th and 6th of 2021, that you swore that you did nothing wrong. 
21 Is that accurate that that's what you said during your testimony? 
22 
23 
24 
25 Mr. Parrotta. Hold on just one second. 
Am I allowed to go on mute one second? 
Mr.- Sure thing. Let me know when you're ready. 
[Discussion off the record.] 9  10 
1 Mr. Parrotta. Mr.- he's not certain if that was a verbatim recital of what 
2 he said at the hearing. If you want to ask it a little differently or perhaps ask him to 
3 paraphrase, perhaps, that he did nothing illegal. He testified that he did nothing illegal 
4 on January 5th and 6th, 2021. 
5 Mr.- Fair enough. And wasn't trying to imply that. I wasn't there. So 
6 I'm not trying to do verbatim. But let me ask it in this way. 
7 Mr. Greco, as Mr. Parrotta helpfully said, I'll ask, during your testimony in the 
8 disciplinary proceedings, did you testify in sum and substance that you did nothing illegal 
9 with respect to the events of January 5th and 6th of 2021? 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 Mr. Parrotta. Is that accurate? 
The Witness. Oh, yeah. 
Mr.- I'm sorry. Could you say that again? 
The Witness. Yes. 
Mr. Parrotta. Yes. He replied yes. 
BYMR.-
Q And similarly, again, from public reporting, in sum and substance, did you 
17 testify that, to your knowledge, Roger Stone did nothing illegal in connection with the 
18 events of January 5th and 6th of 2021? 
19 
20 A Yes. 
Q Now, do you have any reason to believe that you, Sal Greco, are under 
21 investigation by the FBI or Department of Justice in connection with the January 6th 
22 attack on the Capitol? 
23 
24 
25 Mr. Parrotta. Just one moment. 
[Discussion off the record.] 
Mr. Parrotta. We're ready to proceed.  1 
2 
3 
4 Mr.- If you'd like, I can ask again, Mr. Greco? 
The Witness. Please. 
BYMR. 
Q Do you have any reason to believe personally that you were under 
5 investigation by the FBI or the Department of Justice in connection with the January 6th 
6 attack on the Capitol? 
7 A Well, I had the NYPD proceeding, and then I have this subpoena, so I 
8 don't --I don't know if there's anything else. 
9 Q So appreciate that perspective. As I understand it, and correct me if I am 
10 wrong, the NYPD proceeding is an internal disciplinary proceeding that's not criminal in 
11 nature. Is that right? 
12 A Yes. 
13 Q All right. And, as I'd explained at the outset and you've seen some of the 
14 subpoena, I work for the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack 
15 on the Capitol, and the purpose of that and the purpose of the committee is to get an 
16 understanding of the facts and circumstances of the attack in order to make 
17 recommendations for legislation, rules, or procedures, and otherwise to report to the 
18 American public what happened that day. 
19 We don't work with the Department of Justice. We have no prosecutorial 
20 authority. Do you understand that? 
21 A Yes. 11 
22 Q All right. So then I'll just ask, again, and this is just to be clear: As you sit 
23 there, do you have any reason to believe that you are under investigation by the FBI or 
24 the Department of Justice in connection with the January 6th attack on the Capitol. 
25 Mr. Parrotta. Just one moment.  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 [Discussion off the record.] 
Mr. Parrotta. He can respond. 
The Witness. I believe it could be possible. 
BYMR.-
Q To your knowledge, do you understand Roger Stone to be under 
6 investigation by the FBI or Department of Justice in connection with the January 6th 
7 attack on the Capitol? 
8 
9 A That could also be possible. 
Q Has the FBI or the Department of Justice sought to interview you in 
10 connection with the investigation of the January 6th attack on the Capitol? 
11 
12 A 
Q No. 
Now, in connection with the events of January 6th, Roger Stone has 
13 repeatedly said publicly that, quote, Roger Stone did nothing wrong, close quote. Are 
14 you aware of that? 
15 
16 A Yes. 
Q To your knowledge, as you said earlier, you testified at your own hearing, 
17 but I'd just ask you directly, to your knowledge, did Roger Stone do anything wrong in 
18 connection with the events of January 6th? 
19 
20 A 
Q Not that I know of. 
It's been reported publicly that Mr. Stone testified on your behalf at the 
21 NYPD disciplinary hearing. Is that accurate? 
22 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A 
Q No, he did not testify on my behalf. 
Did he testify at the hearing? 
No. 
Did he come to the hearing any day? 12  A 
Q Yes. He was at the hearing in the crowd, but not to testify. 
Oh, I see. Okay. So I guess. 
Mr. Parrotta. He was in the audience? 
The Witness. He was in the audience. Sorry. Yes. 13 
1 
2 
3 
4 
5 Mr. Parrotta. They call it the trial room at the New York City Police Department 
6 disciplinary unit, and it's kind of like a courtroom. And is it fair to say he was present 
7 one day at the trial in the audience section? 
8 The Witness. Yes. 
9 Mr. - Now, have you discussed with Mr. Stone the fact that he was 
10 subpoenaed by the January 6th Select Committee, in other words, the body that I work 
11 for on the staff? 
12 
13 
14 
15 Mr. Parrotta. Hold on just one moment, please. 
[Discussion off the record.] 
Mr. Parrotta. You can respond. 
The Witness. I know because it was public. It was public knowledge in, I 
16 believe, it was December, correct, or January. 
17 
18 
19 Mr. Parrotta. Oh, okay. So you know from public knowledge? 
The Witness. Yeah. 
Mr. Okay. But have you discussed with him, Mr. Stone, the fact that he 
20 was subpoenaed? 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 Mr. Parrotta. Hold on just one second. 
[Discussion off the record.] 
The Witness. No. 
BYMR. 
Q Do you know from public reporting that Mr. Stone refused to provide  1 documents or answer questions based on an assertion of the Fifth Amendment? 
2 
3 A Yes. 
Q Have you discussed with Mr. Stone the fact that you were subpoenaed by 
4 the January 6th Select Committee. 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 Mr. Parrotta. Hold on just one moment, please. 
[Discussion off the record.] 
Mr. Parrotta. He's ready to continue. 
Mr.- Go ahead. 
The Witness. I believe he's aware. 
BYMR.-
Q And what makes you say you believe he's aware? 
A Because I do speak to his daughter. 
Q 
A I'm sorry. Say that again. To who? 
I speak to his daughter. 
Q Okay. What's his daughter's name? 
A Adria. 
Q And you conveyed to her about the fact that you received a subpoena? 
A Correct. 
Q And did she convey to you any information from her father, that is Roger 
20 Stone, in response to the fact that you've been subpoena? 
21 
22 
23 
24 A Did she tell him? 
Q Yeah. Do you know if she told him? 
A 
Q I'm just assuming that more than likely, yes. 
Did she tell you anything, anything conveyed from Mr. Stone to you about 
25 your subpoena? 14  1 
2 A 
Q Oh, no. 
All right. Now, I don't want to know about any conversations with Mr. 
3 Parrotta, your attorney at all. So, putting that aside, did anyone else tell you to refuse 15 
4 to answer questions based on the Fifth Amendment to the select committee's questions 
5 about January 5th and 6th, 2021? 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 Mr. Parrotta. Just one second. 
[Discussion off the record.] 
Mr. Parrotta. We can proceed. 
The Witness. No. 
BYMR.-
Q In the course of your interactions with Mr. Stone, did he ever discuss his 
12 views with you prior to the 2020 Presidential election about what actions President 
13 Trump should take with respect to that election? Just generally, did he talk to you about 
14 that? 
15 
16 A 
Q What do you mean, like, what he says publicly? 
I'm just asking did Mr. Stone discuss with you his views on actions that 
17 President Trump should take with respect to the 2020 Presidential election. 
18 
19 A 
Q Other than what he publicly says, we don't discuss, like, matters like that. 
So, other than what he publicly says, you mean you don't have any private 
20 conversations with him, again, talking about the 2020 Presidential election and what 
21 President Trump should do? 
22 A I believe, up to the run-up of that, he was still facing the --getting commuted 
23 or pardoned or something like that. So he was more worried about that than, let's say, 
24 the election. And, you know, the election wasn't until November, right? 
25 Q That's right. It was November 3rd of 2020.  16 
1 Prior to that date, did you know Mr. Stone to be undertaking any efforts to 
2 support President Trump's re-election campaign, prior to November 3rd of 2020? 
3 A No, he was not --he was not a part of the campaign, or he didn't get paid for 
4 anything like that that I know of. 
5 Q And not asking --thank you for that, but put aside being paid for the 
6 campaign, did you understand him to be doing anything, otherwise, to support President 
7 Trump's re-election effort in the run-up to the election on November 3rd? 
8 A I think he --he's supportive of him as his friend, but I don't know of any 
9 actions or things like that. 
10 Q Prior to that election day, did you know whether Roger Stone was 
11 communicating with President Trump about strategy for the election? Did he tell you? 
12 A From what I --I could tell you, I don't know of any communications other 
13 than that he was commuted, that he called him, which was public that he called him on 
14 the phone in July or June, whatever it was, to tell him he commuted his sentence. 
15 Q Understood. Putting that aside, did you understand Mr. Stone to have 
16 been in touch with President Trump about the 2020 Presidential election before the 
17 election? 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 Mr. Parrotta. Just one moment. 
[Discussion off the record.] 
The Witness. I don't know any specifics. 
BYMR.-
Q Do you know any generalities? Did he tell you that he was, at least, talking 
23 to President Trump about the election prior to election day? 
24 
25 A No. 
BYMR.-:  1 Q Did you know Mr. Stone to be in contact with anyone in the White House 
2 about election strategy in the lead up to election day? 
3 
4 A 
Q No. 
And do you know whether Mr. Stone was communicating with anyone in 
5 President Trump's re-election campaign about strategy in the lead up to election day? 
6 
7 A 
Q No. 
Now, it's been publicly reported that, on or about November 5th of 17 
8 2020 --so that's 2 days after the election --that Mr. Stone relaunched what he called the 
9 "stop the steal" campaign. Is that accurate, to your knowledge, that he relaunched the 
10 campaign in the few days after the election? 
11 A I don't know if it was him that --I don't remember if it was him or if he was a 
12 part of it. 
13 Q Well, how about this, Mr. Greco, what do you know about the "stop the 
14 steal" efforts, so to speak, that Mr. Stone has affiliated himself with? How did that get 
15 going after the election, and what was Mr. Stone's role with it? 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 Mr. Parrotta. Just one moment. 
[Discussion off the record.] 
Mr. Parrotta. You can re-ask the question, Mr. -
Mr. - Sure. Thank you. 
BYMR.-: 
Q Mr. Greco, just trying to understand, do you know when I use a term "stop 
22 the steal," what does that mean to you in the context of Roger Stone? What was Mr. 
23 Stone doing under the moniker "stop the steal"? 
24 Mr. Parrotta. Hold on. We just discussed it. What do you think Mr. 
25 Stone's --can I just rephrase the question and see if it's acceptable? What do you  18 
1 believe was Roger Stone's involvement in the efforts after the election of November 2020 
2 to be involved with "stop the steal," the so-called "stop the steal," or anything like that? 
3 The Witness. What I believe, because there was never any direct conversation 
4 about this, I don't believe he was the person in charge of that campaign. 
5 BYMR.-
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 Q Okay. Who do you think was? 
A I believe it's public knowledge. It's actually --I believe Ali is his name. 
Q Ali Alexander? 
A That's it. 
Q All right. Do you know Mr. Alexander? 
A I don't know him personally. We've only, like, walked past each other I 
12 would say. 
13 
14 
15 
16 Q What did you understand his relationship to be with Roger Stone. 
Mr. Parrotta. If you know? 
Mr.- Right. 
The Witness. Maybe a friend or colleague, maybe worked together. I don't 
17 know. I don't know if they worked together in the past. I've never spoken to Ali. 
18 
19 Q BYMR.-: 
Understood you've not spoken to Mr. Alexander. When did you first 
20 become aware that Mr. Stone was familiar with Mr. Alexander? 
21 A Probably either maybe December or November, that there was some kind of 
22 relationship with. 
23 
24 
25 Q So this is 2020 after the election, is what you're saying? 
A Correct. 
Q And you understood, just so I'm clear, Ali Alexander to be at the front of or  1 leading the "stop the steal" effort? 
2 
3 A 
Q From what I understand and believed, yes. 
Now, did you understand that "stop the steal" was a phrase that Mr. Stone 
4 himself had coined back in 2016 when President Trump first ran for election? Did you 
5 know that? 
6 A I believe --1 believe he was or he conamed it. Might have been someone 
7 else, too. 19 
8 Q And the fact that Mr. Alexander after the 2020 election was using the "stop 
9 the steal" term, did that cause any friction, to your knowledge, with Mr. Stone? 
10 
11 A That I don't know. I don't know. 
Q What did you know, as best you can recall, about Mr. Stone's involvement 
12 with Mr. Alexander and "stop the steal"? What was Mr. Stone's role? What was he 
13 generally doing, to your knowledge? 
14 [Discussion off the record.] 
15 The Witness. Okay. I know that they're friends, but I don't know the exact 
16 involvement of what they both --whatever, if they had any business. I don't really get 
17 into specifics, because I don't --I don't know that other guy. 
18 BY MR. 
19 Q That's fine that you don't know Mr. Alexander, and, again, I'm just asking the 
20 best that you know. What did you understand Mr. Stone himself to be doing in 
21 connection with the "stop the steal" campaign after the election? 
22 
23 A I don't know. 
Q So it's not something you had discussed with him at all between November 
24 and January? 
25 A No, not like in regards to "stop the steal" or I'm not --that's like a political  20 
1 thing he's doing, if he was involved. And I don't know every little move that he would 
2 make, say, politically. 
3 Q And understood you wouldn't know every little move; I'm just asking at 
4 whatever level you did know, what did you understand Mr. Stone to be doing during that 
5 time of November 2020 to January of 2021? 
6 
7 
8 Mr. Parrotta. One moment. 
[Discussion off the record.] 
The Witness. I know he's an ardent Trump supporter, but I don't know the exact 
9 specifics. 
10 BYMR-
11 Q It's been publicly reported that, on or about November 5th of 2020, Mr. 
12 Stone made the decision to begin raising money in support of the "stop the steal" 
13 campaign. Did you understand him to be raising funds for "stop the steal" during this 
14 time of November 2020 to January of 2021? 
15 A I read something publicly about this, but I don't remember, again, the 
16 specifics of that either. 
17 
18 
19 
20 Mr. Parrotta. Hold on just one moment. 
[Discussion off the record.] 
Mr. Parrotta. Go ahead. 
The Witness. Yeah. I don't know if there were any discussions or what he was 
21 doing, because we never discussed --like, I never asked or discussed about the whole, 
22 whatever it was, "stop the steal" or that whole campaign or whatever it was. 
23 BYMR.-
24 Q Okay. It's been reported and Mr. Stone has talked about it publicly that, 
25 during this time period we're looking at, the 3 months, November 2020 to January of  21 
1 2021, that Mr. Stone was appearing at "stop the steal" rallies. Were you generally 
2 aware of the fact that he was making appearances at rallies in support of the "stop the 
3 steal" effort? 
4 A I do know he does go to the rallies, but I don't know which, you 
5 know --there's different people there in charge of the rallies. I don't know if it's "stop 
6 the steal" or whatever it is. 
7 Q Put aside the events in D.C. on January 5th and 6th of 2021 for now, prior to 
8 that, did you go with Mr. Stone to any of those rallies, you know, whether "stop the steal" 
9 or whatever, but in support of the effort to overturn the results of the election? 
10 
11 
12 
13 A From November? 
Q Yep, of 2020 through --up to but not at January 5th and 6th of 2021. 
A I don't believe I was at any --it was any rallies I was at. 
Q Were you in Washington, D.C., at any point in connection with Mr. Stone in 
14 December of 2020 that you remember? 
15 
16 A Yes. 
Q All right. And see if this jogs your memory: There was a rally that was 
17 held in D.C. on December 12th, a Saturday, of 2020, but there's public reporting that Mr. 
18 Stone was in the city the night of December 11th and spoke to supporters outside a hotel 
19 that evening. 
20 Does that sound familiar to you that he was speaking to people from a hotel on a 
21 Friday night in December of 2020? 
22 
23 
24 
25 Mr. Parrotta. Just one moment. 
[Discussion off the record.] 
Mr. Parrotta. He can answer. 
The Witness. Yeah. I'll explain this, kind of, almost like when I testified on the  22 
1 NYPD. On December 11th, there was a thing it was called AMPFest. It was like an 
2 AMPFest reunion or whatever, like they were honoring the people that spoke for them at 
3 the AMPFest that was in Florida at some point in 2020. 
4 So I think it was October. So he --he --he asked me to come, you know, because 
5 he was going to be there. And, once he was done speaking in a hotel room, there was 
6 about --you know, he took like six or seven of us decided to go to a cigar bar. From the 
7 cigar bar, when we left, when you see us --when he's walking to the street, he saw, I 
8 guess, his friend or something, the guy --like, someone who I think he works for Alex 
9 Jones or something. He works for lnfoWars. 
10 So he went up there and says, he said: I'm going to say a couple words. He 
11 said two words and he left. So it wasn't a rally; it was an impromptu, kind of, like, 
12 almost a mistake that we just happened to walk through and then he heard his friend on 
13 the megaphone and we went --and he said two words, and we went back to the hotel, 
14 and I left. 
15 Q Just so we're clear for the record, when you say "AMPFest," am I saying that 
16 right or could you spell it so we know what we're talking about? 
17 
18 
19 
20 A 
Q 
A 
Q It's A-M-P Fest. 
And what is AMPFest? 
It's an event that happens in --happened in October that year. 
So Mr. Stone was in town in Washington, D.C., on December 11th of 2020 in 
21 connection with AMPFest? 
22 A It was something --they were, like, having the people --some of the people 
23 that spoke at that event come back to speak in, like, a room or something inside of the 
24 hotel over there. 
25 Q Were you there when Mr. Stone gave his remarks inside the hotel?  23 
1 A I was --we were in the hotel, but it was --I don't remember what was --was 
2 said or whatever there. It was almost --it wasn't too long we were in there either. It 
3 was a short --short time we were in the room or whatever when he was speaking. 
4 Because it was a short thing. It was, like --I wasn't really --I didn't know exactly 
5 about this whole event or whatever was going on, but he just wanted me to come so I 
6 could've saw him that day. 
7 Q But, again --but you were there in the hotel room when he gave whatever 
8 remarks he gave, that is, Mr. Stone? 
9 A Yeah. I believe it was also --it could have been --it could have been 
10 recorded. There was cameras. People --people have this footage of it. 
11 Q Okay. And the substance of his remarks, did it have to do with the election, 
12 the Presidential election, that is? 
13 
14 
15 A 
Q 
A It's so far along; I don't remember. 
What is AMPFest? 
AMPFest is like --it's like --it's like an event they have. It was in Florida. 
16 don't know if it was in Miami or one of those towns. It was, like, 2020. I don't know if 
17 they have it every year, but I was there --I was --I remember this group of people that 
18 run it then asked him to come to this thing on December 11th. That's what he was 
19 there for. 
20 
21 
22 Q 
A 
Q But is it political in nature AMPFest? 
Correct. It's political. 
Okay. And, again, I'm not asking the particulars, but I mean, it was --the 
23 talk of the town on December 11th and in political circles about the Presidential election. 
24 Do you remember that's what Mr. Stone was talking about for however long he was 
25 speaking in the hotel room?  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 A I don't know the specifics of exactly what he was saying. 
Q Again, not asking for specifics, but was he talking about the election? 
Mr. Parrotta. Do you have a recollection of that or --
The Witness. I don't remember exactly what it was. I wish I could tell you. 
Mr. Parrotta. Okay. 
BYMR.-: 
Q Mr. Greco, did you know that people were in town for a protest the 
8 following day, December 12th, about the Presidential election? 
9 A I would believe --what you're telling me now is --I'm remembering that 
10 there was something the next day. I don't remember, you know, what it was for, 
11 because I wasn't going to stick around for that. 
12 Q And why did Mr. Stone ask you to come down to be with him on 
13 December 11th? Do you know? 
He wanted, like, to hang out. He wanted me to see him. 24 
14 
15 A 
Q Did it have anything to do with in making sure he was safe in large crowds in 
16 D.C. on the 11th --
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 A No. 
Q --or to provide him security in any way? 
Remember, they can't record head shakes or nods. 
A Oh, sorry. No. 
Q Okay. Did Mr. Stone, to your knowledge, did he go to the rally in D.C. the 
22 next day on December 12th? 
23 A From what I understand, I believe, he left --I left that night, and I believe he 
24 left either that --early in the morning, because I don't believe he stayed in D.C. that day. 
25 Q Regarding when you ran into the people that Mr. Stone recognized, see if  1 this rings a bell, was the person you're referring to from lnfoWars is his name Owen 
2 Shroyer? 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 A Yes. 
Q And just for the record, that's S-h-r-o-y-e-r. 
A co-host of Alex Jones on lnfoWars? 
A Correct. 
Q What is the nature of Mr. Stone's relationship with Alex Jones from what 
8 you've observed since 2018? 25 
9 A He used to --I believe he worked, they worked together, worked for him on 
10 the show. 
11 
12 Q 
A I think you're talking about Mr. Shroyer and Mr. Jones worked together? 
No. I think Roger worked with Owen on a show or something up until the 
13 day when everything infamously happened. 
14 
15 Q What day are you talking about, just so I'm clear? 
A I think after his --the arrest, January 2019. I think right after that I didn't 
16 see him on the show anymore. 
17 Q Oh, I see. Okay. So is December --why don't I ask this first: What about 
18 Mr. Stone's relationship with Alex Jones directly, what did you understand, just based on 
19 your perspective and knowledge, the nature of the relationship over those several years? 
20 A I'd say they were colleagues because he worked for him. I don't know how 
21 many times --I don't know when he would speak to him or anything like that. I don't 
22 know the specifics of that. 
23 Q So who worked for whom? You're saying Mr. Stone, he worked for Info 
24 Wars run by Alex Jones? 
25 A Correct, up until that point.  26 
1 Q Okay. So that evening of December 11th, after you left the hotel and you 
2 were coming back, it's that Mr. Stone saw Owen Shroyer using a megaphone. Is that 
3 right? 
4 A Yes. He either saw him or we could hear his voice, because it was him --I 
5 don't know what he was saying, but he recognized him. 
6 Q It's also been reported and there's video or footage that, when Mr. Stone 
7 was in the company of Mr. Shroyer that evening and you, that Enrique Tarrio of the Proud 
8 Boys was also there. Do you remember that? 
9 Mr. Parrotta. He can answer that. 
10 The Witness. What was the question again? 
11 
12 Q BYMR.-
It's been reported and there's footage that Enrique Tarrio of the Proud Boys 
13 was also there at the same time with Mr. Stone, Mr. Shroyer on that night of 
14 December 11th of 2020. Do you recall Mr. Tarrio being there? 
15 A When --when Roger went to go get the megaphone, yes, I believe he was 
16 either standing behind Owen or next to him or behind that little crowd, that top step, 
17 wherever that was, he was standing. 
18 
19 
20 
21 Tarrio? 
22 
23 
24 
25 Q 
A 
Q Did Mr. Stone know Mr. Tarrio prior to that day, to your knowledge? 
To my knowledge, yes. 
And what was the nature of the relationship between Mr. Stone and Mr. 
Mr. Parrotta. Hold on one moment, please. 
[Discussion off the record.] 
Mr. Parrotta. We can continue. 
The Witness. Yeah. I don't know the specifics of their relationship.  BYMR. 
Did you understand them to be friends? 
I would say they're friendly. 27 
1 
2 
3 
4 Q 
A 
Q And in what circumstances would you see them together, you know? Prior 
5 to December of 2020, just on your own observations, how did you come to the view that 
6 they were friendly? 
7 A I --he would --the only time you would see this guy is he --obviously, it's 
8 just like in my trial, same thing. He shows up to events, so that's the nature of seeing 
9 him. He'll be at the event. I would see him when he comes in at the event, because 
10 you can't kick people out. 
11 
12 
13 Q 
A 
Q The "he" you're talking to is Enrique Tarrio? 
Correct. 
Our understanding is that, you know, from the time that Mr. Stone was 
14 charged back in 2019 that Enrique Tarrio and other Proud Boys would show up to support 
15 Mr. Stone, you know, whether a court or otherwise. 
16 Did you have that same understanding based on what you saw? 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 Mr. Parrotta. One moment. 
[Discussion off the record.] 
The Witness. They seemed to support him. I just don't know the specifics. 
BYMR.-: 
Q It came up in Mr. Stone's case. Were you familiar with the fact that an 
22 image was posted to Roger Stone's social media with the cross hair over the face of the 
23 judge overseeing that case? Do you remember? 
24 
25 A 
Q I remember that incident. 
All right. And, as part of that incident, maybe you remember that Mr.  1 Stone told the court that he used other people to do some of his social media and that 
2 one of those other people was Enrique Tarrio. Do you remember that? 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 Mr. Parrotta. Hold on one moment. 
[Discussion off the record.] 
The Witness. Yeah. I don't know who does his or who did his social media. 
BYMR.-
Q Were you aware of the fact that Mr. Stone had said one of the people was 
8 Enrique Tarrio? 
Publicly I remember reading about this --this incident. 28 
9 
10 A 
Q And so how would Mr. Stone talk about Mr. Tarrio? Put aside the fact that 
11 the Proud Boys and Mr. Tarrio would come to events. How would Mr. Stone talk about 
12 him with you and his views of Mr. Tarrio? 
13 
14 
15 
16 Mr. Parrotta. One moment, please. 
[Discussion off the record.] 
Mr. Parrotta. We can continue. 
The Witness. Yeah. We didn't really discuss him or the Proud Boys because I'm 
17 not a fan of, we'll say, of them or, you know, I don't like them, so to speak. So we didn't 
18 want to --he didn't bring that up around me. 
19 Q So he had to have known that, so what did you tell him about why you were 
20 not a fan of the Proud Boys? 
21 A We don't have the --we'll just say, we don't have the same views nor is it a 
22 good thing for a law enforcement person to try to be buddy buddies with the Proud Boys 
23 or any one of these groups. 
24 
25 Q Did you --did you share that view with Mr. Stone that --
Mr. Parrotta. I'm sorry. Hold on.  1 
2 
3 [Discussion off the record.] 
Mr. Parrotta. We can continue. 
The Witness. Yeah. I always just did my best to avoid this group or these 
4 people, because I'm not --obviously, I can't stop them publicly if they come to a place. 
5 When it's public, it's public, but if they're --we didn't discuss them or just, you know --I 
6 always did my best never to bring them up or talk about them. 
7 BYMR.-: 
8 Q What, in particular, gave you concerns about the Proud Boys? Was it 
9 engaging in violence or something else? 29 
10 A Probably a little bit --it's just the stigma. Well, I mean, one of their --isn't 
11 one of their mottos is drinking or something. I don't even drink. 
12 
13 Q 
A So your problem with the Proud Boys is the fact that they would drink? 
I'm saying that's one of their things, right? That they --it's public that they 
14 drink a lot or they like to go drinking? 
15 
16 
17 
18 Mr. Parrotta. Hold on one moment. 
[Discussion off the record.] 
Mr. Parrotta. You can continue. 
The Witness. Yeah, I just don't like a lot of the things they have advocated for or 
19 have done. 
20 BY MR. 
21 
22 
23 Q 
A 
Q Does that include advocating for and engaging in violence? 
Yes. 
Did you share your concern with Mr. Stone that he was associating with 
24 people who were associated with violence in this way? 
25 Mr. Parrotta. Hold on one second.  30 
[Discussion off the record.] 1 
2 The Witness. It's not my business to tell him who he can or can't associate with, 
3 if he is going to associate with someone or people. 
4 BYMR.-
5 
6 
7 Q 
A 
Q So, no, you never brought that up with him? 
Not that I remember. 
Now, another person who was photographed or filmed as being there the 
8 night of December 11th of 2020 with Mr. Tarrio was a gentleman named Ethan Nordean, 
9 also a Proud Boy. Do you know Mr. Nordean or know of him? 
10 
11 
12 
13 A 
Q 
A 
Q I know of him. 
And when did you first learn of him? Was it before that night? 
I believe long before that night. It was some time in 2019. 
Right. There's a photo, at least, within the press of you being at an event 
14 where Mr. Nordean is present with other Proud Boys. You familiar with what I'm talking 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 about? 
them. A 
Q 
A 
Q Yes. 
Is that where you first met him? 
That's when I learned about what the Proud Boys --or I was learning about 
And was that in connection with a demonstration about Mr. Stone's case, or 
21 was it something else? 
22 A No. It was just a regular rally. I was --it was some kind of rally that was in 
23 D.C. or whatever that day. 
24 Q And so what was the nature of your relationship with Mr. Nordean between 
25 2019 and then when he was there on December 11th of 2020?  1 
2 
3 Mr. Parrotta. Hold on one moment. 
[Discussion off the record.] 
The Witness. I met him at that rally 2 years ago. It was an innocuous 
4 conversation, just trying to find out about this group of people, and that was the gist of 
5 ever speaking to this guy. 
6 BY MR. 
7 
8 
9 Q 
A 
Q Did you talk to him again the night of December 11th of 2020? 
No. 
Did you understand Mr. Stone to be associated with Mr. Nordean, to be 
10 familiar with him in the same way he was with Mr. Tarrio? 
11 A From what I --from what I know, I've never seen him speak to this man or 
12 even look at this guy directly. I don't know about that night. I don't remember --he 
13 was standing next to him, but I don't know if they spoke, so --
14 Q There's another Proud Boy by the name of Joseph Biggs who has been 31 
15 charged with Mr. Nordean and Mr. Tarrio, among others, in connection with January 6th. 
16 Do you know who Joseph Biggs is or know of him? 
17 A I know of him. 
18 
19 
20 Q 
A 
Q Had you previously run across him as you had Mr. Nordean and Mr. Tarrio? 
Yes. He also comes to events. 
Did you understand him to have been a formally an employee of Info Wars, 
21 the company run by Mr. Alex Jones? 
22 A Yes. 
23 Q And what would you say if you knew is the relationship between Mr. Stone 
24 and Joseph Biggs, if any? 
25 A I don't know --I don't know if they're friends or --I don't know their  32 
1 relationship. 
2 Q Did you yourself have any sort of relationship with Mr. Biggs, friendly or 
3 professional? 
4 A If --once again, if they're at an event, when they're there, they're there. 
5 What are you going to do? 
6 Q So you would run across him at events, but otherwise you weren't socializing 
7 or talking with him? 
8 
9 A 
Q No. 
Now in terms of Mr. Stone's communications, how he would communicate 
10 with people, not in person, but by phone, does he have any preferred method for 
11 communication? Does he use encrypted apps like Signal or Telegram, or will he use his 
12 cell phone and just call people regularly? What do you know about that? 
13 
14 
15 
16 A 
Q 
A 
Q As far as communicating with people? 
Yes. 
There's text messages and I guess calling people. 
Those are ways to do it. So you yourself when you communicated with Mr. 
17 Stone, will you just do it through a regular phone if it's by phone, a regular phone call? 
18 
19 
20 
21 A 
Q 
A 
Q My phone. 
Yes. 
So, in the past, that's what I would do. 
Okay. Would he ever use if you, say, the app Signal, which allows you to 
22 call through the app but not through over the phone wires. You familiar with that 
23 capability? 
24 
25 A 
Q Yes. 
Does Mr. Stone communicate in that way? Has he done that with you  33 
1 before an app like Signal? 
Yes. I believe he's either has used it or he might be using it. 2 
3 A 
Q Okay. How about in terms of texting or messaging? Did Mr. Stone, when 
4 it comes to you, would he send you messages through encrypted messaging apps like 
5 Signal or something similar? 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 Mr. Parrotta. Hold on one moment. 
[Discussion off the record.] 
Mr. Parrotta. We can continue. 
BYMR.-: 
Q Mr. Greco, did you understand what I was trying to get at, just trying to 
11 understand his communication methods, Mr. Stone, that is, and when it comes to 
12 messaging when he would message --just start with you, would he prefer to use an 
13 encrypted app, or would he use regular text messaging? How did that work? 
14 
15 
16 
17 A 
Q 
A 
Q He has --he has texted me normal on the phone and also through Signal. 
Did he ever express to you a preference to do one over the other? 
No. 
It's been reported that he had a Telegram chat. Telegram's an app like 
18 Signal. Are you familiar with Telegram? 
19 A Yeah, I'm familiar with Telegram. 
20 Q It's been reported he had and we've seen copies of a Telegram chat called 
21 "The Friends of Stone." Were you on that chat? 
22 
23 A 
Q On Telegram? 
Uh-huh. I believe it's Telegram or might be Parler. Do you know what I'm 
24 talking about? 
25 A This is news to me if it's Telegram.  Mr. Parrotta. Hold on one moment. 
[Discussion off the record.] 
Mr. Parrotta. Can you ask the question again about Telegram,1111? 
BYMR.-34 
1 
2 
3 
4 
5 Q And maybe I'm getting the app wrong. Let me just ask this: Did you know 
6 Mr. Stone to have a group messaging chat between November of 2020 and January of 
7 2021 called "The Friends of Stone"? 
8 
9 A I know about the group messaging app, yes. 
Q Okay. And, if I got it wrong, which app did you understand that to have 
10 been on? 
11 
12 
13 
14 A I believe it was Signal.

Mr. Parrotta. We can continue. 
BYMR.-3 
4 
5 
6 Q 
A Okay. Mr. Greco, were you a member of that chat group, Friends of Stone? 
Yes. I was in the --the Signal --was --the Signal one. 
7 Q It's been reported that Enrique Tarrio was also a member of Friends of 
8 Stone. Is that right, to your knowledge? 
9 A He might have been. I don't remember who's in there or whatever, how 
10 many people it is. 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 Q So it wouldn't surprise you if Mr. Tarrio was on that? You just don't know? 
Mr. Parrotta. Hold on one second. 
[Discussion off the record.] 
Mr. Parrotta. He can answer. 
The Witness. Yeah. There could have been any --upwards of 40 or 50 people, 
16 so I have no idea. I can't remember exactly who it was in there. 
17 
18 Q Okay. One other person it's been reported was a member of that chat 
19 group was a gentleman named Elmer Stewart Rhodes, the founder of the Oath Keepers. 
20 So I'll start with this: Do you know who Mr. Rhodes is? 
21 
22 
23 
24 A 
Q 
A 
Q I learned of him after the date of --you know, in January. 
All right. So this is the guy with the eye patch and wears the cowboy hat? 
Correct. 
All right. Did you know prior to the date that we're focused on that 
25 Mr. Stone was associating with Mr. Rhodes?  1 A From --from my knowledge, I've never heard him bring him up or spoke 
2 of --or he never --I never heard him say he spoke to him. We'll put it like that. 
3 Q Did you hear Mr. Stone talk about the Oath Keepers as an organization, 
4 though, prior to January 6th? 
5 
6 A 
Q No. I didn't hear anything about no Oath Keepers. 
Now, it's been reported, and there is photos of Mr. Stone having Oath 
7 Keepers as security at "stop the steal" rallies before January 5th and 6th of 2021. 36 
8 Were you aware that Oath Keepers were providing security to Mr. Stone for some 
9 of those rallies? 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 Mr. Parrotta. One moment. 
[Discussion off the record.] 
The Witness. I --I didn't know anything about it. 
BYMR.-: 
Q All right. And how would you describe that Friends of Stone chat just as a 
15 general matter? What was the point of it, the one that's on Signal and that you're a 
16 member of, in the timeframe we're focused on, November of 2020 to January of 2021? 
17 A It was basically --I think it was more of a who's --people post positive things 
18 about Roger or anyone who is a Republican, you know, something like that. It was more 
19 of a --posting things as far as, like --like --how can I --like a positive posting of 
20 some --of --of him or conservative people online. 
21 Q So who --and I understand you might not remember everyone who is on 
22 that chat. Who were the other people that you know were a member of that chat 
23 during the 3 months we're looking at? 
24 A That's the thing. I don't --I can't recall, because it's so long ago now, and 
25 it's so many people.  1 Q How about other people in Mr. Stone's orbit that would work closely with 
2 him? I mean, are you familiar with Kristin Davis? 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Yes. Of course, Kristin Davis. I know Kristin. 
And what is the nature of Ms. Davis' relationship with Mr. Stone? 
She's his secretary. 
And has that been true since 2018 when you first met Mr. Stone? 
From what I understand, yes. 
How about Jacob Engels, E-n-g-e-1-s? 
Jacob, I believe, he works on and off for Roger. He doesn't, like, work for 
10 him every single --I don't know if he does things for him every day, because he also is a 
11 journalist or --he works for a publication, I believe. 37 
12 Q Did you know Mr. Engels to be, at least at one time, affiliated with the Proud 
13 Boys? 
14 A From what I --from what I understand, much like my trial was when they 
15 asked me the same thing, I know him to --I believe he --he's written articles about them. 
16 I don't know him to ever actually be a member of this group, nor does he practice the 
17 same things or whatever these people believe in or --I believe the guy hasn't even 
18 received a parking ticket. 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 to be? 
25 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A How about Enrique de la Torre? Do you know Mr. de la Torre? 
Enrique de la Torre? 
Correct. Also goes by Enrique Alejandro? Do you know -­
Yes. I know who Enrique Alejandro is. 
Okay. And what do you understand Enrique's relationship with Mr. Stone 
I believe he also --he works --I think he does, like, video stuff maybe for  38 
1 him. From what I --I mean, that's as much as I can remember. 
2 Q Now, after December 11th, it was reported that --I think on December 27th, 
3 Roger Stone met with President Trump at President Trump's golf club in Florida a few 
4 days after the President had pardoned Mr. Stone. 
5 Are you aware of the fact the two men saw each other in and around that time? 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 Mr. Parrotta. One moment. 
[Discussion off the record.] 
The Witness. Only from the public media. 
BYMR.-
Q Did you have any advance knowledge, or did Mr. Stone tell you that he was 
11 expecting to be pardoned by the President? I think it was on December 23rd, on or 
12 about. 
13 A No. Never --never mentioned anything about it --we were --the only 
14 thing I could say is everybody was hoping and praying that that could happen. 
15 Q Now, did --did Mr. Stone tell you --from the point of after the election, 
16 through to January 6th, did you know Mr. Stone to be in touch with President Trump at 
17 all, just as a general matter, other than seeing the report about that meeting at the golf 
18 club? 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 A No. 
Mr. Parrotta. One moment. You can answer. 
The Witness. No. 
Q Did you understand during that same time period, Mr. Stone to be in touch 
24 with anyone at the White House about --and I'm just focused on the election issues. So, 
25 after the election through January 6th, did you know Mr. Stone to be in touch with  39 
1 anyone at the White House? 
2 
3 A 
Q No. 
Did you understand Mr. Stone generally to have any connections at the 
4 White House other than President Trump? 
5 A I would be honest. I've never heard him mention anyone from the White 
6 House or speak to anyone from the White House. Not in front of me, anyway, if there 
7 was --I don't know the specifics of anything, but --
8 Q How about President Trump's reelection campaign? Did you know 
9 Mr. Stone to be in touch with anyone within the campaign after the election and up 
10 through, say, January 6th? 
11 
12 A 
Q No. Not that I know of. 
Who, if anyone, within President Trump's orbit did Mr. Stone talk about 
13 being in touch with that you know of? And I'm using a general term because, if it's not 
14 the White House or not the campaign, was there anyone else he would talk to you about 
15 that was close to President Trump that Mr. Stone himself was in contact with? 
16 
17 
18 Mr. Parrotta. One moment. 
[Discussion off the record.] 
The Witness. I don't know of anyone that he spoke to around the President 
19 during this time. 
20 Mr.- Let me see. Now, I'll just say for the record, I had estimated 1:30, 
21 Mr. Greco, but that was under the understanding that you were going to, you know, 
22 invoke as to all the questions. So appreciate you answering. That's the only reason 
23 why this is taking longer, and --
24 
25 The Witness. I apologize. 
Mr. - Which is not a way to discourage you. I just want to be mindful of  40 
1 what I had said, so --
2 BYMR.-
3 Q It's also --let me ask this: There was public reporting about two Danish 
4 filmmakers doing a documentary on Mr. Stone and --for several years up through January 
5 of 2021, following Mr. Stone around at certain points. 
6 So were you aware of the fact that he had these filmmakers filming him? 
7 
8 A Yes. 
Q And one of the things they filmed was, on November 5th of 2020, Mr. Stone 
9 talking to General Michael Flynn about "stop the steal." 
10 Did you know Roger Stone to be friendly with General Flynn. 
11 
12 
13 
14 Mr. Parrotta. Just one moment. 
[Discussion off the record.] 
Mr. Parrotta. We can continue. 
The Witness. I don't know --I don't know the specifics of --of his relationship, if 
15 he had one with General Mike Flynn. 
16 BYMR.-: 
17 Q Would you know them to at least be in touch with one another, whatever 
18 the nature of the relationship, that they would communicate with one another? 
19 A Again, I don't --I don't know the specifics if they did or they didn't. He 
20 never --I've never discussed Mike Flynn with him. 
21 Q Now, he --the reporting on the filmmakers shows them having captured 
22 footage of you and Mr. Stone together at certain points. I'm just asking generally: Is it 
23 right that they filmed the two of you together, at least at certain points, over the course 
24 of their work? 
25 A I believe so, yes.  1 Q I'm going to transition --well, before I get to the days, January 5th and 6th, 
2 I'll start with this: Did you know a woman named Julie Fancelli prior to those days? 
3 Were you aware of who that was? 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 A I --Julie Fancelli? 
Mr. Parrotta. If you don't know, you don't know. 
The Witness. I don't --I don't recall this. I don't recall the person. 
BYMR.-
Q She's been described as the heiress to the family that created the grocery 
9 store chain Publix, P-u-b-1-i-x. I don't know if that rings a bell for you. 
10 
11 
12 
13 A I know the store, but I don't know this --
Mr. Parrotta. Okay. 
BYMR.-
Q All right. So did you --I just have to round this out. Do you know --had 
14 you ever heard Mr. Stone talk about Julie Fancelli prior to January 5th or 6th of 2021 --
15 
16 A No. 
Q --that you know? No. All right. 41 
17 Now, she's been reported to have been the person who funded much, if not all, of 
18 the rally that took place at the Ellipse on January 6th of 2021, so I'm just providing that by 
19 way of background. 
20 
21 A Okay. 
Q Did Mr. Stone ever discuss with you prior to you two being in --to the events 
22 in D.C. on the 5th and 6th --did he ever discuss with you that he was involved in planning 
23 for protests or rallies that were going to take place in Washington on the 5th and 6th? 
24 
25 A 
Q No. 
Do you remember when you first learned that Mr. Stone was planning to  42 
1 travel to Washington to be there on the 5th and 6th of January of 2021? 
2 A It's either the last days of December or --I believe it was the last days of 
3 December. 
4 Q And what did Mr. Stone tell you about what was going to happen in D.C. and 
5 why he was going to be there? 
6 A Originally, he was --he had said that he was --he was asked to speak at 
7 a --at the event, and we weren't --he wasn't 100 percent sure that this was going 
8 to --that he was going to go to the event, because it was a little back and forth. So it 
9 wasn't 100 percent until maybe I knew like --one of the first couple of days in January 
10 that that was going to happen. 
11 Q Did Mr. Stone provide you any more color about what the back and forth 
12 was about and who it was with over whether he would speak? 
13 
14 
15 D.C.? 
16 
17 A 
Q 
A 
Q That, no. I don't know the specifics of any of that. 
Did Mr. Stone say whether or not he was being paid to appear to speak in 
I don't know any of the specifics of payments. 
Did Mr. Stone talk about who else might be speaking at the event or events 
18 that he was aware of? 
19 A No. I didn't --he didn't tell me anything about who is going to be there or 
20 anything. I mean, I have no knowledge of any specifics of the --of any of those rallies. 
21 Q Did you understand that President Trump would be speaking at the event, 
22 though, at least? 
23 A The --the event that you're speaking about, I believe, is separate. That was 
24 the one that was supposed to be at the Ellipse, right? 
25 Q The President did speak at the Ellipse, yes, on the 6th?  1 
2 A 
Q Okay. That --yeah, that's separate. 
Okay. So what event or events was Mr. Stone talking to you about in the 
3 lead-up to that day? 
4 A The --what was that? The one about the January 5th --the original one 
5 that he actually spoke at. There were two rallies he spoke at that day, and there was 43 
6 one --the one from the 6th, I believe, was just another rally he was supposed to speak at. 
7 Q So the ones at the 5th, you talked about two. One was at the Supreme 
8 Court, and the other was at Freedom Plaza? 
9 A Correct. 
10 Q And the one on the 6th, was that supposed to be, you know, near the Capitol 
11 itself in the afternoon of the 6th? 
12 A Yeah. There was something --some --some --I don't know exactly where 
13 it was supposed to be, but I know it was supposed to be a speech given somewhere 
14 around that --you know, day area. I don't know --you know. 
15 
16 Q 
A I apologize. Go ahead. 
No, I'm saying I don't know exactly the areas of D.C., so I'm not aware --even 
17 when I left, I always get lost when I go there. 
18 Q I feel the same way in New York, so --why was Mr. Stone telling you about 
19 January 5th and 6th? And maybe the other way to ask this was: Was he asking you to 
20 come with him to the city for those days? 
21 A He wanted --he --he wanted me to --you know, he wanted me to be there 
22 with him, you know, like support him, be his friend. But he just didn't --we just didn't 
23 know who was going to be at the event. 
24 Q When you say to support you as a friend --to support Mr. Stone as a friend, 
25 did he ask you to provide security for him, either or both of those days in January?  Mr. Parrotta. One moment. 
[Discussion off the record.] 
Mr. Parrotta. We can proceed. 44 
1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 Mr.- Mr. Greco, do you remember what I was asking when we stopped? 
The Witness. Yeah. 
Mr. Parrotta. Refresh our recollection. I forget. Sorry. 
Mr. - I don't know. You guys seemed to be talking about it, but I'll ask 
8 again, Mr. Parrotta. 
9 BYMR.-: 
10 Q Mr. Greco, did Mr. Stone ask you to --you know, to help provide security for 
11 him on January 5th and 6th? 
12 
13 A No. I was --I was there as his friend, not as security. 
Q What did you understand about what Mr. Stone's plan was for security on 
14 those 2 days, if anything? 
15 
16 
17 
18 A As far as security-wise? 
Q Correct. 
A I was --from what I understood, there was supposed to be security there. 
Q All right. Is that standard for Mr. Stone when he makes public 
19 appearances, to have some sort of security with him? 
20 
21 A It depends if the rally or where it's at and the size of the rally. 
Q All right. But, for a rally of this sort, with this many people expected to 
22 come, it was typical for Mr. Stone to have personal security? 
23 A I would --I would venture to say, with a crowd that would be that big, he 
24 probably should have a lot of security with him --
25 Q Okay.  1 
2 45 
A --or anybody in general, anybody who is speaking. 
Q And so, did he talk --did Mr. Stone talk to you at all before January 5th and 
3 6th about who in particular was going to provide security for him? 
4 Mr. Parrotta. One moment. 
5 [Discussion off the record.] 
6 Mr. Parrotta. _, I think at this point, my client --being that it's leading 
7 up to, like, January 4th, 5th, and 6th of 2021, from this point on, we're going to be 
8 asserting the Fifth Amendment. 
9 Mr.- Okay. Well, then --understand that, Mr. Parrotta. We'll need 
10 Mr. Greco to say that in response to the question, so I'll just ask again so we have a clear 
11 record. 
12 BYMR.-
13 Q Mr. Greco, did Mr. Stone --prior to January 5th and 6th of 2021, did 
14 Mr. Stone tell you specifically who was going to provide security for him on those 2 days? 
15 
16 
17 
18 Mr. Parrotta. Say you're asserting the Fifth. 
The Witness. I'm asserting the Fifth Amendment. 
BYMR. 
Q It's been reported publicly --and I understand that --let me ask this: 
19 During your disciplinary hearing, did you testify about what you did personally on 
20 January 5th and 6th in Washington, D.C.? 
21 [Discussion off the record.] 
22 
23 
24 The Witness. Yes. I believe so. 
BYMR.-
Q And it's also been reported that you talked about the fact that, on those 
25 2 days --that is, January 5th and 6th --that you testified about Roger Stone having  1 security provided by the Oath Keepers. 
2 Did you testify about that at your hearing? 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 Mr. Parrotta. One moment. 
[Discussion off the record.] 
Mr. Parrotta. We can proceed. 
Q 
A BYMR.-
Mr. Greco, do you need me to restate the question? 
No. I believe that the --
The Witness. What was it? I believe that he had --I believe it was the Oath 
10 Keepers with security. 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 Mr. Parrotta. You believe that you testified to -­
The Witness. That I testified to --
Mr. Parrotta. At the NYPD trial. 
The Witness. At the NYPD trial. 
BYMR.-
Q Okay. That's all we're trying to ask about, the same stuff you already 46 
17 testified about, and trying to understand that. So I'll come back to the fact --1 mean, did 
18 you --when did you learn that Mr. Stone was having Oath Keepers provide security for 
19 him on January 5th and 6th? When did you first learn that? 
20 
21 
22 Mr. Parrotta. One moment. 
[Discussion off the record.] 
Mr. Parrotta. Mr- you know what? Ask the question again. We're 
23 going to try to get through this, I think. 
24 Mr- Okay. 
25 BYMR.- 47 
1 Q How did you first learn that Mr. Stone was having Oath Keepers provide him 
2 security on January 5th and 6th, Mr. Greco? 
3 A I believe it might have been a day or two or somewhere in that range that he 
4 had told --you know, he said that these guys --this guy or whatever, the Oath Keepers, 
5 were going to be the security for --for him or the event. 
6 Q Now, did you know who the Oath Keepers were at that time? From having 
7 been at other rallies, like where the Proud Boys showed up, were you familiar at least 
8 with the organization, the Oath Keepers? 
9 
10 A To the best of my knowledge, I never heard of who these guys were until --
Q Okay. How did Mr. Stone say he came to be in touch with them such that 
11 they'd be providing him security in D.C. on the 5th and 6th? Did he tell you? 
12 
13 A 
Q No. He never --he never went over specifics. 
Do you remember --now, I know you came --when did you arrive in D.C.? 
14 Did you come on January 5th? 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 A Correct. On the 5th. 
Q And you ended up staying at The Willard. Is that right? 
A That's correct. 
Q And did you leave on the 6th in the afternoon? 
A I left around --I believe it was 4:45. 
Q Went back home to New York? 
A That --well, I --we drove --drove Roger to the airport. And then, from the 
22 airport, I went home. 
23 Q Okay. In terms of the Oath Keepers, when did you first personally interact 
24 with them yourself, the security team that Mr. Stone had? Was it at the Supreme Court 
25 event on January 5th, or was it before that?  48 
1 A No. The morning of the 5th. 
2 Q Okay. And so who did you meet, and how did they get introduced to you? 
3 How many of them were there? Just how did that work? 
4 A I met, I believe, with --the guy's name was Josh, was the one that you hear 
5 about in my trial all the time. I met them somewhere else to --some other location. It 
6 wasn't where we were at at the hotel. I went to --with him to go to pick up Roger at the 
7 airport, and were four other --the five people that guarded him that day were the five 
8 people that were there. 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 Q Okay. How did you first get in touch with Josh? 
And we'll say his full name is Joshua James. Does that sound right? 
A 
Q 
A Correct. 
Okay. How did you --who put you in touch with Mr. James? 
It was --it was Roger gave me a number to call, and said, This is Josh. 
14 Q And do you remember how he gave you that number? Was it by a text 
15 message, or was it by messaging app? Did he call you and tell you? 
16 A I don't know if it was a message or he called or something. I know --I just 
17 know I have it, that the --the number he said to call. 
18 
19 Q 
A So, do you remember where you met Mr. James to pick him up? 
Like I said, I don't know D.C. that well. I just know it was another spot in 
20 D.C. And then from there is where his car was. And then from there is --we went 
21 straight to the --the airport. 
22 Q Do you remember the names of the other people --of the five in the security 
23 detail that you dealt with? 
24 A No. I don't remember their names at all. I don't even know if I had their 
25 names, to be honest.  49 
Q Were any of these guys armed with firearms, to your knowledge? 1 
2 A To the best of my knowledge --and, trust me, I wanted to see if this was --I 
3 didn't see any weapons on them. 
4 
5 Q 
A Did you ask them if they were armed at any point during those 2 days? 
I don't remember asking them. I do remember looking at them to see if I 
6 see anything on them. 
7 
8 
9 Q And you didn't see anything on them? 
A 
Q I didn't see anything that stuck out. The car was clean. His car was clean. 
Did Mr. James or any of the other four tell you that they had firearms, 
10 though, even if you didn't see them? 
11 
12 A No. I don't remember hearing any --I never heard anything like that. 
Q And just what was your general impression of Mr. James and the other four 
13 people in the security detail from your time spent with them over those 2 days? 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 Mr. Parrotta. Hold on a second. 
[Discussion off the record.] 
Mr. Parrotta. Go on. 
The Witness. They seemed very professional. 
BYMR-
Q Did they talk --did any of them talk with you at all about the Presidential 
20 election, that you recall? 
21 
22 A 
Q I don't remember specifics if there was any small talk, things like that. 
Did they talk at all about the --at any point about the joint session of 
23 Congress that was scheduled for January 6th to certify the Presidential election? Did 
24 that come up at all? 
25 A No.  1 Q Okay. Did they talk to you about how it is they got hooked up with 
2 Mr. Stone to provide him security, how that worked? 
3 
4 A 
Q No. I don't remember ever hearing anything like that. 
Did they discuss whether or not they were being paid for their efforts to 
5 protect Mr. Stone? 
6 A I don't --I don't know how they got --if they were getting paid or who was 
7 paying --I don't know the specifics of the --who is paying who for what around here. 
8 Q So did you --did the --I guess it would have been the six of you? Is that 
9 right? The five of them plus you went to pick up Mr. Stone? 
10 A 
11 Kristin. Yeah. There was --there was five of them and me to pick up Roger and 
And did you pick them up --it was from an airport? 
Yes. 
Did Ms. Davis and Mr. Stone --did they fly on a private jet? 50 
12 
13 
14 
15 Q 
A 
Q 
A I don't remember if it was a private jet or a regular --I don't know how --the 
16 airports, it's different in, like, Newark or whatever airports around here. It's Dulles, or 
17 whatever it is. It's a different airport. I don't know --
18 Q Did you pick them up from --did you pick them up from what looked to be a 
19 small area --like what might be consistent with where private jets arrive at Dulles, or was 
20 it from the main terminal? Do you remember? 
21 A I don't remember. It sounded like a regular --you know, this is a 
22 different --I've never been to this airport before. 
23 Q Okay. Fair enough. Where did you take Mr. Stone and Ms. Davis after 
24 you picked them up? 
25 A We went straight to the hotel.  1 
2 
3 Q And that's The Willard? 
A Correct. 
Q And who was paying for --do you know who was paying for Mr. Stone's 
4 room at The Willard? 51 
5 A I don't know --I don't know the specifics of who's --who paid for the room, 
6 or if the room was under his name or somebody else paid --that, I don't know. 
7 Q And so you got back to the hotel. And did the --I'll call them the Oath 
8 Keepers, the five-security detail. Did they wait there until Mr. Stone left to go to the 
9 Supreme Court for his first appearance, to your knowledge? 
10 A You mean, what were the --those Oath Keepers, security guys, what were 
11 they doing? 
12 Q Yeah. Did they stay there at the hotel and wait for you all to then go to the 
13 Supreme Court? 
14 A Yeah. From --from what I can remember, I just remember them 
15 being --they were either outside the hotel or in the lobby. 
16 Q And do you remember what time you all made your way over to the 
17 Supreme Court, just roughly? 
18 A I can't remember exact --I don't remember the timing. I remember it was 
19 in the --it had to be in the afternoon, I'd say. 
20 
21 
22 Q Still light outside? 
A Yeah. 
Q All right. And you accompanied Mr. Stone to the Supreme Court with the 
23 Oath Keepers security? 
24 
25 A Yes. 
Q And then, just generally, at the event, at the Supreme Court, anything out of  52 
1 the ordinary take place while you were there that you can remember? 
2 A It was just --basically, it was just people --they were --they seemed very 
3 happy. They were all asking for autographs from him or whatever and taking pictures. 
4 Q Was Alex Jones or Owen Shroyer there at that rally that you remember? 
5 A No, he was not. Not at the first one. 
6 Q And was Stewart Rhodes --who you now know to be Stewart Rhodes, the 
7 eye patch, founder of the Oath Keepers --did you see him at that rally? 
8 
9 A 
Q I --I have never seen this guy in person. 
With regard to the security detail of Oath Keepers, was --was it your 
10 impression that Joshua James was running the detail, or was it one of the other guys in 
11 charge, so to speak? 
12 A From what I --from what I remember, I would believe that Josh was the 
13 person in charge of the group. 
14 Q Did you understand Josh to be reporting up to anybody else in the Oath 
15 Keepers about the work he was doing? 
16 A Not that I know of. I don't know the specifics about that. 
17 Q Are you familiar with a gentleman --an African-American gentleman who 
18 was working with the Oath Keepers who goes by the nickname, or call sign, Whip? Did 
19 you meet him? 
20 A You know, on that day, with so many people out there --there is thousands 
21 of people that came up to all of us, so I don't know --I don't want to say something, and 
22 then it turns into, you know --
23 Q I'm just --you know, all we're asking is the best of your recollection. 
24 understand there is a lot going on, so do you remember meeting a gentleman --his full 
25 name is Michael Simmons or Michael Greene, but an African-American, goes by Whip,  1 and was working with the Oath Keepers? Do you remember meeting him? 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 next? 
9 
10 
11 
12 A I don't want to say yes or no, because I don't know if he --
Mr. Parrotta. You don't recall. 
The Witness. I don't recall. 
Mr.- Okay. 
BYMR.-
Q After Mr. Stone was done speaking at the Supreme Court, where did he go 
A From the Supreme Court, we went back to the hotel. 
Q That's The Willard? 
A Correct. 
Q All right. And then, between then, when you got back, and the Freedom 
13 Plaza event, did Mr. Stone go anywhere outside of The Willard Hotel? 
14 A Not outside --no. We didn't leave the hotel until it was --that rally, the 
15 next one. 
16 Q Prior --so, from the time you're back at the hotel and in the next rally, 53 
17 Freedom Plaza, did Mr. Stone meet with anybody in The Willard Hotel that you know of? 
18 
19 
20 A Yes. 
Q Who? 
A Alex Jones and --basically the roomful of people that had --Alex Jones' crew, 
21 they were --whatever they were filming, he went to his room. 
22 
23 Q 
A Did you go with Mr. Stone to that room? 
Originally, I did. Then I believe I --I had to go back to my own room for 
24 something. I needed --I don't know, whatever --maybe to go to the bathroom. I don't 
25 remember. But then I went back to the room about --whatever it was, 10, 15 minutes  54 
1 later. 
2 Q And about how long would you say Mr. Stone was in the room together with 
3 Mr. Jones and his crew? 
4 A I can't put a time --I don't know --I don't want to say. It was maybe 
5 20 minutes or 30 minutes or something like that. It couldn't have been that long. 
6 Q Just simple question. How did you all know, or how did Mr. Stone know 
7 that Mr. Jones was there? Do you know how that --they hooked up with each other 
8 that day? 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
15 Mr. Stone? 
A 
Q 
A 
Q That, I don't know. I don't remember that. 
Was Owen Shroyer in the room with Mr. Jones? 
Yes. Owen Shroyer was there. 
Was Jacob Engels in town with you all that day, January 5th? 
Yes. Jacob was also there. 
Okay. He was also at the --at the --at Alex Jones' room with you and 
He came --I believe it was very brief. 
Ms. Kristin Davis was also in D.C. with you all? 
Yes. 
As you said from the airport. That's right. 16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 Did she come up to the meeting with Mr. Jones? 
A No. 
Q Now, had the two Danish documentarians gotten to the hotel by that point 
23 that day? 
24 
25 Or how about this: When do you first remember seeing them? 
A I remember seeing them on the --on the morning of the 6th.  1 
2 
3 Q 
A 
Q Okay. On the morning of the 6th, not before that? 
I don't remember if they were on the 5th. I don't remember that. 
Okay. Who else was in the room with Alex Jones, Mr. Shroyer, and his 
4 crew? Do you remember anybody else in particular? 
5 A I don't know the names of whoever works for him, but the --obviously, 55 
6 it's --the guys that work for him were there, and then there was --I guess this is the part 
7 where --there is a part where General Mike Flynn walks in, because that's when he did 
8 that interview he was going to do with him. 
9 And that's when I left and Roger left, and whoever else was, you know --because 
10 we had a bunch of people with us. Well, he did. And he brought them back to his 
11 room, and then that's when the other rally was going to start. So we went back to the 
12 room after that. 
13 Q I just want to make sure I understand. 
14 So the group of you were in Mr. Jones' room until General Flynn showed up for his 
15 interview, and then, at that point, you all left? 
16 A Well, I had --remember, I went back to my room, and I came back down. 
17 And then, within a couple of --whatever it was, a few minutes, then we went back to 
18 Roger's room. 
19 Q Okay. But it was when Ms. --when General Flynn came in --and I 
20 understood you left and came back. But, once General Flynn came in, you and 
21 Mr. Stone --you exited the room and went back? 
22 
23 A 
Q Correct. 
All right. Why? Did you have to leave? Was there not room enough in 
24 there for General Flynn, or what was the reason for exiting at that point? 
25 A I believe --well, you could watch the interview. The interview was actually  56 
1 on the show, because he was doing the interview in the room. You know, didn't want all 
2 of us --because there is nowhere to go. It's a suite. It wasn't --you know, it would 
3 have been crowded in the back of the room. 
4 Q Did Mr. Stone connect with General Flynn, to your knowledge, at any point 
5 later that day through the end of the 5th? 
6 
7 A 
Q No. 
And putting aside the rally at Freedom Plaza, which we'll get to in a minute, 
8 did Mr. Stone connect with Alex Jones again through the end of January --of the 5th, that 
9 you know of? 
10 A That I know of, no. 
11 
12 
13 Q 
A 
Q How about Owen Shroyer? Same question. 
No, not that I know of. 
Now, at this point on the 5th, were you aware of the fact that Enrique Tarrio 
14 had been arrested the day before in D.C.? 
15 A Yeah. It was public knowledge. 
16 Q Yeah. Did you know Mr. Stone to have reached out to Mr. Tarrio on the 
17 5th at any point after Mr. Tarrio was released from jail, to talk to him? 
18 A I wouldn't know from any --I don't know of his communications, if he had 
19 any with anybody. The specifics, if he --if he asked about him or --I don't know. He 
20 didn't bring it up. 
21 Q Did he express any concern to you --that is, Mr. Stone express any concern 
22 to you about Mr. Tarrio and the fact of the arrest? Did you all discuss it at all? 
23 A I believe we didn't know --I didn't even know the --I personally didn't know 
24 the facts. We were waiting for everything to come through, because, you know, when 
25 you --I know when you --just because someone is under arrest, you need a while to find  1 out exact all the facts, so --I mean, there was still --that case was ongoing, so nobody 
2 really knew --you only know on, you know, this one's reporting this, that one's 
3 reporting --because it was online. 
4 Q But it was a topic of conversation with Mr. Stone about what was going on 
5 with Mr. Tarrio? 
6 A No. No. He --he --on --on that day, he was --I think he was more 
7 concerned about what he wanted to eat at that time coming out of Jones' suite. 
8 Q We had information that Mr. Stone may have tried to get in touch with 
9 Mr. Tarrio to talk about whether he could get a pardon or something to that effect. 
10 Are you aware of any conversations like that? 
11 
12 A 
Q No. Never heard anything like that. 
All right. So the Freedom Plaza rally, when --did you go with Mr. Stone 
13 over to that when it was for --time for him to speak? 
Yes. 57 
14 
15 A 
Q All right. And did the five Oath Keepers that had --you know, Josh and his 
16 team, did they also accompany you and Mr. Stone to that event? 
17 
18 A 
Q 
19 you all --
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Yes. 
All right. Do you --it was in the evening, right? It was dark outside when 
Yeah. 
Is that right? 
Yeah, it was dark. 
Do you remember about what time it was? Do you remember? 
I don't know if it was 6:00, 7:00 --it could have been 8 o'clock, 7:00. It 
25 was --I can't tell you the exact time. I just remember it was dark, because it's January,  58 
1 so the sun [inaudible]. 
2 Q Now, did you all --when you went over, was it --did you spend any time 
3 listening to other speakers, or you got there, and it was time for Mr. Stone to go on 
4 stage? 
5 A There might have been --he --I think he ended that show, right, or 
6 something like that? 
7 Q So it was towards --so you don't remember hearing other people speak? It 
8 was --
9 A It was --there might have been someone else speaking or --I just don't 
10 remember who now. There might have been people speaking, but he has to wait until 
11 he's got to go up there, so he's got to be waiting in that tent or whatever that little room. 
12 
13 Q 
A Okay. Did you see Mr. Jones and Mr. Shroyer there at that time? 
I don't know if they were --either they might have just spoken, or they had 
14 already spoken. That part, I don't remember. I don't --I think they were supposed to 
15 speak. I just don't remember if I was there for that, because, like I said, when I went 
16 there, somebody else got up and speak. I just don't remember who or what. 
17 Q So the last time you remember seeing Mr. Jones and Shroyer was the --on 
18 the 5th when you were up in their room, or did you see them on the 6th? 
19 A I saw them on the 5th. And, like I said, they might have been on the stage. 
20 I don't remember, because I --we never got to the stage until the very end. But, on the 
21 6th, I don't --I did not see either one of those guys. 
22 Q Okay. So, then, whatever interactions you had with Jones and Mr. Shroyer 
23 on the 5th in the room and then maybe at the rally or not, did you ever hear them 
24 discuss, either with you or other people, about what was going to happen on January 6th 
25 at all? Was that a topic of conversation that you heard them -- 1 
2 A No. No. Nobody --nobody was talking about anything like that. 
Q And I don't mean the attack on the Capitol. I just mean generally their 
3 expectations or what was going to just happen the next day on the 6th? 
No. 59 
4 
5 A 
Q Is it right that Ali Alexander introduced Mr. Stone before Mr. Stone spoke at 
6 the Freedom Plaza event? 
7 A He might have. He might have. I remember him --this is what I mean 
8 when he --walking by me. That's the one time I remember him just walking by up to --I 
9 believe to the stage. 
10 Q Uh-huh. All right. So you don't remember --did you yourself have any 
11 conversation with Mr. Alexander that you can recall on the 5th or the 6th? 
12 
13 A No. 
Q And did you see Mr. Stone talking with Mr. Alexander that you can 
14 remember on the 5th? 
15 A Not that I remember, no. I don't see him on the --I didn't see him until 
16 when he walked by. Like I said, it was very brief. 
17 Q So, after the event at Freedom Plaza, was there --well, I should say: During 
18 Mr. Stone's appearance and while he was there at Freedom Plaza, anything out of the 
19 ordinary that you observed or heard? 
20 
21 A 
Q 
22 speaking? No. 
Did you guys go back to The Willard Hotel after Mr. Stone was done 
23 
24 A Correct. 
Q And understand that Mr. Stone left to go to a hair appointment that evening. 
25 Is that right?  1 
2 A 
Q 60 
Yes. 
Right. Between the time of getting back to the hotel from Freedom Plaza 
3 and leaving to go to the hair appointment, did Mr. Stone go anywhere else outside of the 
4 hotel that you know of? 
5 
6 
7 right? 
8 
9 A No. 
Q We understand you went with Mr. Stone to his hair appointment. Is that 
A Yes. 
Q All right. It was a personal appointment when the shop was already 
10 closed? 
11 
12 A 
Q Correct. 
Now, I have to ask: Why did he wait after his first public appearance to get 
13 his hair done instead of getting it done before his public appearance events of that day? 
14 Do you know? 
15 A I have no --I don't know exactly why he would do something like that, but 
16 that --probably, I would guess --my best guess is the timing was way off. 
17 Q All right. And, as of --after that hair appointment, where did the --where 
18 did Mr. Stone go? Did you guys go back to the hotel? 
19 A He went straight to the hotel, and he went right into his room. I didn't see 
20 him until the next morning. 
21 Q How about the Joshua James and the Oath Keepers? Did they come --did 
22 they come with you to the hair appointment? 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A No. 
Do you know what they were doing the evening of January 5th? 
I have no idea.  61 
1 Q They didn't talk to you about where they were going, who they were seeing, 
2 just anything about what they were up to that night? 
3 
4 
5 at? 
6 A 
Q 
A Nope. 
Do you know where they were staying? Did they say what hotel they were 
No. I don't remember where they were staying or where they were going, 
7 or --I have no idea where those guys were going. 
8 Q What was the plan, then, for the next day when --you know, you put your 
9 head on the pillow the night of January 5th. You expected what, in terms of schedule, 
10 to happen on the 6th, the next day? You were going to go where? Mr. Stone was 
11 going to go where? Just walk us through what you expected. 
12 A The issue with the 6th was the Ellipse. You can't get into the Ellipse 
13 without tickets to that event. And as you could see when I testified, I went with Josh to 
14 try to get not only my ticket and everyone else's ticket, because that --you can't get in 
15 without them. The security can't get in without the tickets either. 
16 So we went on a merry-go-chase from the first entrance, which had a million 
17 people already lined up, and I was --I didn't want to be there --to go all the way around 
18 to --the general and the --said VIP, and the VIP said the same thing to us, that you have 
19 to go up to the general. And that is when we went back to the hotel, and we said, You 
20 know, this isn't going to happen today. 
21 Q I understand that's what ended up happening, and I appreciate that. But, 
22 in terms of the night of the 5th, did you expect for Mr. Stone to be going to the Ellipse 
23 event the next day, that it would be smooth, he'd be there, and you'd there with him, or 
24 is that something that you --I'm just trying to get a sense of what you understood was 
25 going to be happening the next day.  62 
1 A From what I understood, we were supposed --I --we were supposed to have 
2 the tickets, so it was supposed to be very smooth, we go right in and whatever. You 
3 either see the President speak, or --I don't know if he was supposed to speak. I don't 
4 know the exact specifics of all that, but I was supposed to go in, get the tickets, and we 
5 were going to just watch --you know, see the President. It wasn't a whole lot. 
6 Q So did you understand from Mr. Stone, again, talking on January 5th, that 
7 there was a chance that he might speak at the Ellipse on the next morning, or you didn't 
8 know one way or the other? 
9 
10 A 
Q 
11 with Joshua? 
12 A There --there was never a yes or a no on it. 
So how did you get the task to go get the tickets the morning of January 6th 
Because I was --I needed to get a ticket myself, so I think you have to --I 
13 don't know if you have to ID yourself or whatever it is. He said that if you want to come 
14 to the --to this thing, you have to go get your own ticket. So you go, and I --if I went 
15 with him or whatever or someone else, which would be Josh, with security, they can't get 
16 in without tickets either. That was the purpose of that. Because anybody --anybody 
17 could have gone with Josh. It's just that there might have been more than one trip if --I 
18 don't --me personally, then I couldn't go, because I needed that ticket. 
19 Q Did Mr. Stone ever bring up that he was, you know, communicating with 
20 some of the rally planners about the event --
21 
22 A 
Q I don't know. 
--and whether they had tickets for him that you could get more easily? Did 
23 that come up at all? 
24 A No. Like I said, all I know is that I had to go into the Ellipse to get the ticket 
25 for me and anyone else --there was also, you know, other people. So it's like I don't  63 
1 know how many tickets he was supposed to --I was supposed to get, but I never even got 
2 that far. Didn't even --didn't get to the front gate. 
3 Q So did you even get up to ask somebody and say, I'm here to pick up a ticket 
4 for, you know --
5 
6 
7 A 
Q 
A No. 
For Mr. Stone? 
No, because I got --no, because I got to the gate, and I asked, Where do you 
8 go to get into this thing, because it looks --the general admission entrance was packed. 
9 There was so many people there. And he said, There is only one way in. 
10 And I said, If I was to go through this thing, it would take 7 hours just to get 
11 through all these people. I'm not in the mood to --you know, I'm not working today, 
12 you know, so --you know what I mean? I'm just a regular person here. And, if I can't 
13 get in, that's it. 
14 Q So you went back and reported this to Mr. Stone that you couldn't get a 
15 ticket yourself? 
16 A Josh told him that it was a bad idea. And, also, I said that not only was this 
17 not probably going to work today going into the Ellipse, but I wanted to --I didn't want to 
18 be there anymore at that point. I noticed that it was just too many people. There was 
19 more people than I could have ever imagined that were going to --it was only like 8:00, 
20 9:00 in the morning, I'd say, and it was already a crowd of people, much more than I 
21 would ever expect, you know? 
22 
23 
24 Q 
A 
Q Had Mr. Stone asked you to pick up his ticket? 
Yeah. He said the tickets. He did say tickets for --for everybody. 
Okay. But, again, specific to him, he was telling you he didn't have a ticket, 
25 and he needed you to go pick it up?  64 
1 A He didn't say me --me and Josh, so it was --we had to get the tickets for 
2 him, Kristin, whoever else --Kristin, me, anyone else that he wanted to bring in there, 
3 because you can't just walk in. The event itself, without a ticket, from what I 
4 understand, you can't even get in. 
5 Q When you reported back to Mr. --you said Josh reported back to Mr. Stone. 
6 Is that right? 
7 
8 
9 
10 A 
Q 
A 
Q Yes. Me and Josh went back in the hotel to tell him. 
All right. So you were there to hear what Josh told Mr. Stone? 
Correct. 
All right. And so Mr. --so Josh told Mr. Stone it wasn't --in sum and 
11 substance, it's not worth going over there? There is too many people, and we don't 
12 have tickets anyway? 
13 A Right. The sum and substance is we can't get in because the --you can't 
14 get the tickets. You can't even get in there. Without admission, they're not going to 
15 let you up. 
16 
17 
18 
19 Q What was Mr. Stone's reaction to that? 
The Reporter. I'm sorry. I missed the last part of that last answer. 
Mr. Parrotta. Without the tickets, you were saying --
The Witness. I said without the ticket, you can't enter the Ellipse. You can't go 
20 to the event. 
21 BYMR.-
22 
23 Q 
A What was Mr. Stone's reaction to that? 
He said, Then we'll --we'll just --we're going to stay in the hotel. We're not 
24 going to go anywhere. 
25 Q He didn't say anything about having been working with the rally planners,  65 
1 knowing the woman who was funding the event, nothing along those lines in reaction? 
2 
3 A 
Q I don't know. 
Express any sort of displeasure with the fact that he couldn't go to the 
4 events, that --anything along those lines? 
5 A I can remember, I think, everybody was just a little annoyed of how this 
6 whole scenario went down, so --I mean, I had my own emotions that I just woke up and 
7 got --had to go on a merry-go-round, and then, I mean, I feel like a fool. And there is a 
8 million people there already, so --
9 Q Okay. Okay. But Mr. Stone, in particular, did he express any specific 
10 displeasure with what was going on at the Ellipse? 
11 
12 A Yeah, not that I recall. 
Q The reporting on the Danish filmmakers is that they recorded Mr. Stone 
13 talking with Bernie Kerik in the lobby of The Willard the morning of the 6th, talking about 
14 the Ellipse event. So I'll start with this: Do you remember seeing Mr. Kerik at The 
15 Willard on January 6th? 
16 
17 
18 
19 A Yes. I saw him in the lobby. 
Q All right. Did you see Mr. Stone talk to Mr. Kerik that morning? 
A Yeah. I believe he spoke. 
Q Did they talk --from what you saw yourself, did they talk about the event at 
20 the Ellipse? 
21 
22 
23 A 
Q 
A I don't remember the specifics of what was being discussed. 
Do you remember generally what they were talking about? 
I don't know if they was discussing the --what had just transpired or if --or, 
24 you know, just general greetings, because nobody even knew he was there at the hotel. 
25 That was a shock to all of us.  66 
1 Q Well, did you hear Mr. Kerik talk about why he was there once you saw him 
2 and he was speaking to Mr. Stone? 
3 
4 A No. 
Q The --it's been reported, again, that the documentarians captured 
5 Mr. Stone --"capture" is the wrong word --filmed Mr. Stone saying something to the 
6 effect of he felt that people were going to try and embarrass him at the Ellipse event, 
7 have him go wait in line, and then reject him at the door. 
8 Do you remember something along those lines that morning? 
9 
10 
11 
12 A Not --I don't remember him saying this to me or anyone else. 
Q You don't remember anything like that? 
A Yeah, I don't recall hearing --overhearing this. 
Q Okay. Well, whatever it is he might have said, did Mr. Stone actually ever 
13 go over to the Ellipse to try to get into the event? 
14 
15 A Oh, absolutely not. 
Q So, then, why was he down in the lobby that morning where Mr. Kerik was? 
16 If he wasn't going to the event, why was he down there? Do you know? 
17 A When --when Kerik walked by, this was already past the point where I failed 
18 to get the tickets. So this was after that fact. So the other part that --I also mentioned 
19 in my own trial is that being in the lobby, they kicked everybody out of the lobby that was 
20 staying in the hotel. You either had to be in your room or in the lobby, or outside. 
21 Those were the rules of D.C. that day. 
22 
23 
24 Q Because of COVID? 
A Correct. 
Q But why was Mr. Stone downstairs in the lobby if he wasn't going to the 
25 Ellipse event --just trying to get to that very basic point --to see Mr. Kerik?  Like I said, I don't believe it was to see Kerik. I think, when --
1 meant he was present and he saw Kerik. I'll hone on that. 67 
1 
2 
3 A 
Q 
A I think Kerik walked by. It was just a freak occurrence that he happened to 
4 walk through in that --and this was after everything that occurred. 
5 
6 
7 Q Mr. Parrotta could ask it better than me, but I'll try again. 
Mr. Parrotta. Tell me and I'll see what I can do. 
Mr.- Why Mr. Stone was downstairs at the time. Now, I'm not saying to 
8 see Mr. Kerik, but why was he even in the lobby if he wasn't going to the Ellipse event? 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 a.m.? 
14 
15 
16 Mr. Parrotta. Just one moment. 
[Discussion off the record.] 
Mr. Parrotta. All right. Let's see if we can artfully or factually lay it out. 
Why was Roger Stone in the lobby of the hotel on January 6th? Is this in the 
The Witness. This is in the morning. 
Mr. Parrotta. In the a.m. Why was he there? 
The Witness. All right. When we --when I went to try to get the tickets with 
17 Josh and we came back, he was in the lobby with Kristin. Might have been a couple 
18 other people that was supposed to either speak or be at the other rally. 
19 And, when we came back and told him everything, he was still in the lobby. And 
20 that's why you saw Bernie Kerik walk by, is because that was just --happened to be 
21 the --we didn't know he was in the building. He walked by because he was still in the 
22 midst of right after that happened that I had reported back that I didn't want to be there 
23 no more.  68 
1 
2 [2:56 p.m.] 
3 BYMR.-
4 Q Do you remember who the other people were with Mr. Stone at that time 
5 who you said were supposed to speak at other rallies? 
6 A In the lobby I don't remember who exactly those peoples' names. It was so 
7 long ago now. 
8 Q Okay. What was the nature of the event Mr. Stone was scheduled to speak 
9 at in the afternoon of January 6th near the Capitol? Do you know? 
10 A I don't know the specifics of who it was; I just know that there was supposed 
11 to be --you know, he was supposed to speak at a rally; I just don't know whose rally it is, 
12 with names. I'm sorry. It's a different world for me. 
13 Q So, after Mr. Stone decides not to go to the Ellipse, did he go back up to his 
14 room, or did he leave the hotel since he couldn't be in the lobby? 
15 A I believe you saw the famous footage that they took where we were outside 
16 for, like, not even a couple minutes, and I don't know if somebody wanted to smoke or 
17 whoever wanted --the real reason is you got kicked out of the lobby; you either had to go 
18 to the room or go outside. He decided, the couple people, they want to go outside and 
19 they wanted to get a breath of fresh air or smoke or whatever the cases. And then he 
20 went back to the --he said just let's watch it on the TV and stay in the room. That's it. 
21 And that was the gist of everything that happened that morning. 
22 Q And who was in the room --when you got back up to Mr. Stone's room, I've 
23 seen photos, but is it right it was you and Ms. Davis and Mr. Stone and maybe a preacher? 
24 
25 A 
Q Mark Burns, Pastor Mark Burns. 
And then the documentarians were in there, at least, for a little bit of the  69 
1 time that day. Is that right? 
2 A Yes. I believe they were filming up to a certain point. They came back. 
3 They were with us --I believe they were there in the room as well. The shot of us 
4 outside when you step --we go outside on the front, you actually see the documentarian 
5 guy outside filming. 
6 Q So when you got back up to Mr. Stone's room, did you all watch the rally at 
7 the Ellipse and the President's remarks? 
8 
9 A 
Q Yes. 
Did Mr. Stone have any reaction or commentary on the President's remarks 
10 as he was speaking that day that you remember? 
11 
12 A 
Q Not that I remember. 
How about yourself? Did you have any reaction of what was being said or 
13 any concern during the President's remarks? 
14 
15 A 
Q No. 
Was Joshua James and the rest of the security detail from the Oath Keepers, 
16 were they with you all up in that hotel room during this time? 
17 
18 
19 A 
Q 
A No. 
Where were they, to your knowledge? 
From what I was led to believe, I believe they were outside the hotel 
20 because they weren't allowed in the lobby. 
21 Q And what time had you scheduled to meet up with them to make your way 
22 to the rally where Mr. Stone was going to speak at the Capitol? 
23 A The rally, from what I remember, would have been in the afternoon at some 
24 point. I just don't know the exact time, whatever time was supposed --it was in the 
25 afternoon, I believe. It would have been well after the speech from the Ellipse.  1 Q And did you watch --up in the hotel room, did you watch the President's 
2 remarks all the way through to the end? 
3 
4 A Yes. 
Q And then when do you remember first becoming aware that there was 
5 violence at the Capitol or how you became aware of it, just as best you can recall? 
6 A It was on television. They started reporting --you started hearing mixed 70 
7 reports, let's say. There was reports on TV, on the internet, online, there were different 
8 things. You're hearing all kinds of mixed messages, you know. 
9 Mr.- If it's okay, if you indulge me, if we could just take a 5-minute break, 
10 and then I'll try to keep things moving from here, Mr. Greco, and be done before 
11 4 o'clock, okay? But that I can just have 5 minutes. Is that all right, Patrick? 
12 
13 Mr. Parrotta. Yes. 
Mr- Okay. Great. All right. Just give me a break. I'll turn off my 
14 camera or not. You can turn off yours, but I'll be back. Okay. 
15 
16 
17 
18 [Recess.] 
BYMR.-
Q Thanks for the indulgence. It's 3:06. We'll go back on the record. 
And Mr. Greco, we left off when you first learned of violence and you were saying 
19 you saw it on the TV. And just to kind of level set, at any point from when you saw there 
20 was violence at the Capitol through the end of the 6th, the January 6th, did you talk to 
21 Joshua James at all that you remember? 
22 
23 
24 
25 A At the --when I was driving home. 
Q All right. I'll get to that at the end. 
A 
Q It was late. 
Fair enough. I'll come back to that then.  1 Did you talk --once you learned there was violence at the Capitol, between then 
2 and the end of the day, January 6th, did you talk to any other member of that Oath 
3 Keeper security detail? 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 A 
Q No. 
So only Joshua. Understood. At the time --
Mr. Parrotta. Just one second. 
[Discussion off the record.] 
Mr. Parrotta. He just wants --can I ask him a question? 
Mr. - Sure. Sure. 
Mr. Parrotta. Basically, the only individual you spoke with from the Oath 
11 Keepers during these 2 or 3 days was the gentleman Joshua? 
The Witness. Correct. 71 
12 
13 Mr. Parrotta. And you never really spoke to anyone else of anything substantive, 
14 right? 
15 The Witness. No. 
16 Mr. Parrotta. Okay. Just go. 
17 M- Okay. Thank you for that clarification. 
18 BYMR.-
19 Q Prior to the attack on the Capitol, Mr. Greco, did you have any reason to 
20 believe that Joshua or any of the people he was with were going to be going --be 
21 engaged in any violence that day on the 6th? 
22 
23 A 
Q No. No. 
Did you have any reason to believe that Mr. Stone thought there was going 
24 to be violence on January 6th before the violence started? 
25 A No.  72 
1 Q To your knowledge, did Mr. Stone have any role in planning or coordinating 
2 an attack on the Capitol on January 6th? 
3 
4 A 
Q No. 
So, in terms of watching this on TV as it starts to develop that afternoon of 
5 the 6th, did you stay with Mr. Stone and Ms. Davis and the pastor in that room that whole 
6 time before you left for the airport? 
7 A I was there for a while. I believe I had to go back to my room to get my 
8 things. So there might have been the small moment where that was going on, but other 
9 than that, I was there. I was in the room. 
10 Q In all the time that you were in the room with --in Mr. Stone's room, was he 
11 in the room? In other words, did he leave at any point, to your knowledge? 
12 
13 A 
Q No. No. 
And the public reporting on the documentarians is that at some point they 
14 were outside of the room and weren't let back in Mr. Stone's room because Ms. Davis 
15 said Mr. Stone was taking a nap. 
16 Are you familiar with that public reporting and what the documentarians have 
17 said about that? 
18 A Yeah. I remember reading that whether it was in the post or something, 
19 The Washington Post. 
20 Q Yeah. So I don't have any better way of asking this other than to say, can 
21 you just help us understand what the situation was with the nap and the 
22 documentarians? Just what was going on that afternoon? 
23 A They were --you actually see whatever picture was there, the one you saw 
24 with him and Pastor Mark Burns, actually, the documentarian guys are actually in the 
25 room. They were there for quite a while. At certain point, Roger wanted to, I believe,  73 
1 lay down and take a nap or something. They said he was in his room, and he was laying 
2 down. So I don't know if it was --I believe --it might have been Kristen told him: Look, 
3 you guys can just let him sleep because what are you going to do, film him sleeping? 
4 So that's what the gist of that was. And they did come back, and they filmed 
5 everything from us when we all left, which you saw we were in the room waiting to --I 
6 mean, I wanted to leave myself. They filmed that whole part. 
7 Q So the room itself that Mr. Stone was in, was it a suite so that there was a 
8 bedroom area and then also like a living room area where you could sit and watch TV? 
9 
10 A 
Q Correct. 
All right. So, when Ms. Davis said that Mr. Stone wanted to sleep, the 
11 documentarians left for a while. Is that right? 
12 
13 A 
Q Yes. Yes. 
All right. Did you stay in the living room area yourself during that time 
14 when Mr. Stone wanted to sleep? 
15 
16 A 
Q Yeah. I was --1 was in the living room with the TV on the couch. 
All right. Was Ms. Davis with you or was she --I'm not trying to get 
17 personal; just trying to figure out where people were. Did Ms. Davis stay with you in the 
18 living room area, or was she in with Mr. Stone in the bedroom area while he was taking a 
19 nap? 
20 A She did the same thing, I believe, which she also stayed with us, but 
21 then --she was with me, and then she had to go and get her things from her room and 
22 bring them back in the room. Because if they were going to leave, it was either they 
23 were going to leave together, whatever, to go on whatever flight it was, or I had to take 
24 them --because that was basically what the gist of what was going on. 
25 Q I hear you. When you're getting ready to go, I hear you. But, in terms of  1 when Mr. Stone was in the bedroom and Ms. Davis said he was taking a nap, was she in 
2 there with him during that time or was she, to your knowledge, in the living room? 
3 
4 
5 
6 A 
Q 
A 
Q No. She was in the living room. 
All right. So Mr. Stone was in the bedroom area by himself then? 
Correct. 
And do you have any reason --based on what you know, do you know 74 
7 whether he was talking with people on the phone in that room? Was he quiet? What 
8 do you know he was doing in there as best you can tell? 
9 A Best that I could tell you it looked like he was sleeping. 
10 Q Okay. All right. Now the reporting in the Post is that Mr. Stone had been 
11 working on potential pardons, Presidential pardons, for people, kind of, in the lead up to 
12 
13 that day. 
A Did you see that? 
I didn't see any of this. The first I'm learning of this is when they're writing 
14 these things, because I'm like, when did this happen? 
15 Q Part of that reporting, though, is that Mr. Stone supposedly had a meeting 
16 set up at the White House possibly later the day on January 6th to talk about pardons. 
17 Do you hear anything of the sort on that day or have any reason to think he was going to 
18 go to the White House that day? 
19 A No. No way. I didn't hear any of this. I never know any of the specifics. 
20 You couldn't even get out of the hotel. It would have been a crazy idea. 
21 Q Now, in relation to when you first saw that violence broke out at the Capitol 
22 and Mr. Stone going into the room to take a nap, did he go in to take the nap before you 
23 saw that there was violence, or was it after? Do you remember? 
24 
25 A 
Q No. This was well after. 
So then, in the time period once you saw the violence has broken out and  75 
1 when Mr. Stone goes to take a nap, what was the general conversation in the room and, 
2 particularly, Mr. Stone, his commentary, on what you all were seeing on the screen, his 
3 reaction? 
4 A I think everybody was in disbelief and knew this was counterproductive 
5 to --at least, to Trump and, you know, the next thing --I was more of a how do I --how 
6 do we go home, because this is --is this going to get worse? And there's a lot of 
7 questions going on on my end personally. Is it safe to be here? Am I going to --are 
8 they --are these people going to come in the building? 
9 I mean, my head was going all over the place. You really still don't know what's 
10 going on, because you're getting the reports on, I believe, it was Fox or CNN or whatever 
11 was on TV. And then you see --you're checking the internet. They're saying police 
12 officers are just saying it's okay. And then see the guy with the crazy horns walking 
13 around; you're like: What is this, you know? 
14 So that was what was going on in the room. Really just --it was like the 
15 confusion that you saw was almost kind of like that was going on in the street was the 
16 same in the room, because we don't know --do you leave? What happens if we go 
17 outside; are we going to get jumped? Are they coming in the hotel? 
18 We were thinking this is counterproductive. And this is all the thoughts in what 
19 was being said at the time. 
20 Q When was the decision made that Mr. Stone was not going to go up to the 
21 event to speak that afternoon at the Capitol? Was it before or after the violence 
22 started, to your knowledge? 
23 A I believe once the violence happened, that was it. That was the 
24 end --nothing was going to happen that day. 
25 Q Did you have to call Joshua to let him know you wouldn't be going up to the  76 
1 Capitol since he was supposed to be going with you all to provide security? 
2 A No. I believe --when there was this --one time I did try to contact him was 
3 to ask --I wanted to ask him if it was safe for me to leave. I wanted to leave. I don't 
4 know who was outside the hotel because my car was in the basement. You could leave 
5 through the back, which I don't have any eyes --because you can only see the side of the 
6 hotel from the room. 
7 And I saw, you know, what looked like more than a couple football fields' worth of 
8 people, and that's kind of not a situation that I'm trained to actually even want to be 
9 around. So I wanted to leave, but without eyes outside in the front or in the back, I 
10 didn't know whether I could. So I tried to reach out to him thinking that --but the call 
11 never even went through. 
12 So I had no idea what was going on with all that out there. So I had to wait. 
13 And then eventually I think Roger then said or something: I have a way. We're going 
14 to go home. 
15 Q During the time that you were at the hotel before you left to go to the 
16 airport, do you know who, if anyone, Mr. Stone was in contact with by phone? Was he 
17 calling anybody? Were people calling him? 
18 A That I don't know. I don't know if he was calling anybody or if he was 
19 texting anybody. I don't know. 
20 Q Do you know whether --again, just to be more particular, any efforts to 
21 reach anyone at the White House or anyone close to President Trump during that time 
22 period that afternoon? 
23 
24 A 
Q No. 
So the arrangements are made, in short, you're able --he's able to get a 
25 flight arranged, and you drive him and Kristen out to the airport so that he can get on that  77 
1 flight and fly home to Florida? 
A Correct. 2 
3 
4 
5 Q All right. And then you make your way back home to New York after that? 
A Correct. 
Q You said you talked to Joshua at some point that evening on your way back. 
6 Is that right? 
7 
8 A Correct. Yeah, I think he called me. 
Q As much as you can remember about that conversation, what was it? 
9 What did you all discuss? 
10 A I think it was more of a small talk thing. The thing I remember is that he 
11 kept clicking off. So people, I guess, his phone, people were calling him. So there was 
12 a lot of hold on, hold on, hold on, because that was --the gist --the gist of the 
13 conversation was more of a --like, a good-bye, trying to say good-bye. And I don't know 
14 exactly what had happened, you know, because I tried to call him, but I was, like: Listen, 
15 we left. 
16 Because he was, you know --I think he called to think that we were still there, but 
17 we weren't. I says: No. I'm going home right now. 
18 
19 
20 Q 
A 
Q Did he bring up the fact that he had gone in the Capitol? 
Not that I remember. I don't remember anything. 
I would imagine --I'm not trying to be cute, but you would remember if he 
21 told you he was one of the people who went in the Capitol that day? 
22 
23 A Of course. 
Q Okay. So he didn't bring that up at all? He didn't say where he had gone 
24 that afternoon or what he had done? 
25 A I don't remember hearing that.  78 
1 Q Did he comment on the days' events, say anything about what had 
2 happened that day? You know, it's a natural point of conversation; people have gone in 
3 the Capitol. He didn't talk about that at all? 
4 A Not that I remember. 
5 Q Did you ask him where he went since he wasn't with you? I mean, since he 
6 was supposed to have been with you, you didn't ask, "Hey, where did you go?" 
7 A I think I said --I don't really remember much of this conversation other than 
8 it being --it was something --it was --the context was brief, but due to the fact that, I 
9 guess, he was on his phone or people calling him. 
10 
11 
12 
13 Mr. Parrotta. Hold on a moment. 
[Discussion off the record.] 
Mr. Parrotta. Just one moment. Go ahead. 
The Witness. Yeah. So, I mean, the gist of it more was he just wanted to know 
14 if Roger was okay, because I believe he was assuming that we were still in the hotel or 
15 wherever. So once he --once you tell him Roger left and I'm on my way home, that's 
16 basically the gist of the conversation. 
17 
18 
19 
20 Q 
A 
Q 
A Did you ever talk to Joshua again after that time? 
Yes. He called me one other time. 
And when was that, and can you tell us about that conversation? 
That was the day that I was interviewed by the NYPD because they were 
21 conducting their own little investigation, and they wanted to know who I --because I still 
22 had the number in my phone or whatever when he called me back on the 6th. And I 
23 said: Oh, well, you can call him. He was the head of the security, not me. 
24 So he had called me to ask me, basically, says: The NYPD called me, like, they 
25 asked me about you, like, doing security, which you didn't, and nobody, you know,  79 
1 whatever else --they asked him something else, but that's all in the --in the --whatever 
2 was in the --they asked me about, so that was all --that was the gist of that conversation 
3 as well. 
4 Q Did you have any --as part of that proceeding, Mr. Greco, did you have any 
5 text messages with Mr. James, Joshua James, that you gave NYPD that maybe you don't 
6 any longer have? Did you have anything like that on your phone? 
7 A If I have the --they wanted --they never asked for the text messages. 
8 don't think they have them. 
9 
10 Q Okay. Had you been texting with Mr. James at all? 
A Other than the 5th and the 6th, that was the only day, because --and there 
11 was one line. 
12 
13 
14 Q Do you still have those by chance, even if it's just logistics? 
A I don't think so. 
Q Would you mind --can you look after this and I'll follow up with Mr. Parrotta 
15 just to see, just look in your phone and see if they're still there? 
16 
17 A 
Q Yeah. 
Do you have your phone on you? Can you just check if it's --if you have 
18 any there? 
19 
20 A If anything, I'll look after this, and I'll reach out to you. 
Q At the time that Mr. James called to talk to you because of the NYPD 
21 investigation, were you aware at that point that he had gone in the Capitol? 
22 A Was it the --that was late in January? You hear different things, but you 
23 can't put your --you don't know who's who. What you're reading and what you're, you 
24 know, waiting to see what's being reported, you're hearing different things. So I don't 
25 know who exactly did what. I don't know if it was him, if it was someone else, it was  80 
1 other people. People dressed up like this or like that. It's --it's still chaotic at that 
2 time. 
3 Q I hear you, but did you ask him at that time you talked to him, "Hey, did you 
4 go in the Capitol because that could reflect on you, and as the NYPD is looking at this, it's 
5 natural to want to know, what's the story with you in what you did in case it comes back 
6 on me and reflects badly on me"? 
7 A I don't remember discussing if, especially on that phone call. This one 
8 was --because they had called him, he had just --because he called me to say, you know: 
9 This guy's calling and what not, and I don't know. They asked me if you did the security. 
10 Q And you haven't talked to him since that last phone call then about the NYPD 
11 contact? 
12 
13 
14 
15 A 
Q 
A No. I never --after --after that day, I believe, I blocked his number. 
Has his legal team reached out to you at all to talk to you about -­
No. 
Q All right. Has anybody's legal team of someone who's charged with being 
16 involved on the January 6th, have they reached out to you about the events of that day? 
17 
18 A 
Q No. 
Now, have you had --I think it's fair to say pretty quick after January 6th, Mr. 
19 Stone was publicly saying I or, you know, he did nothing wrong in connection. He was 
20 out there. Did he express to you a concern that he was going to be accused of having 
21 had some sort of role in the attack on the Capitol? 
22 
23 A No. Never. 
Q Are you familiar with the fact that he pretty soon after the events of that day 
24 starting saying Roger Stone did nothing wrong about the attack on the Capitol? Did you 
25 see that he was saying those sorts of things?  81 
1 A I believe he's always --he's always said that from the first incident with the 
2 first thing with the --what was that? When he testified in Congress the first time and 
3 then the --they raided his house and all of that. He's always said Roger Stone did 
4 nothing wrong. 
5 Q He does about that, about that incident for sure where he was accused of 
6 doing something wrong. I'm interested in why he was saying or he felt the need to say 
7 Roger Stone did nothing wrong with respect to January 6th? Have you ever had that 
8 conversation with him? 
9 A Well, I'd say this: Who was that? One of those papers, ABC or something, 
10 hit him right away --they were hitting him right away trying to accuse him of being 
11 involved in it directly. So I believe that's how he started the whole "Roger Stone did 
12 nothing wrong." 
13 Q In the footage that was in The Washington Post piece from the 
14 documentarians about Mr. Stone saying it's time to leave the hotel room on the 6th and 
15 get out, there's a brief clip, and it seems to be an urgency to him wanting to leave the city 
16 that afternoon of the 6th. 
17 What was, as best from your perception, was there an urgency in his actions that 
18 day to get out of town as soon as possible? 
19 Mr. Parrotta. Hold on one moment. 
20 [Discussion off the record.] 
21 The Witness. Yeah. The best way I could describe it, there was --there 
22 was --there was a million different people around the hotel and with a million different 
23 agendas, so I guess the urgency was to: It's not safe to be here. 
24 I think it's --you know, he wanted to leave as --like I said, I was under the 
25 impression of what if they actually came to the hotel and did something.  82 
1 Q Now, the documentarians also recorded, according to The Washington Post, 
2 that, after January 6th but before President Trump left office, that Mr. Stone was making 
3 efforts to get a pardon for himself in connection with the 2020 Presidential election. 
4 Were you aware of that at the time? 
5 A No. You're telling me something I didn't even know. I didn't even know 
6 about this. 
7 Q And, similarly, that potentially seeking a pardon for Mr. Stone's conduct, 
8 whatever it was in relation to January 6th, were you aware of any effort along those 
9 lines? 
10 
11 A 
Q No. 
Just give me one moment. 
12 Since January 6th, have you talked to Mr. Stone about the fact that his security 
13 detail, Joshua James and others, went in the Capitol and have been charged with crimes 
14 in connection with that day? 
15 
16 A 
Q No. 
He hasn't spoken about it at all with you, the fact that Joshua has been 
17 charged and has brought a lot of attention on Mr. Stone's connection with Joshua and the 
18 other Oath Keepers? 
19 A No, because --I mean, I have my own --the guy's --my trial was basically all 
20 about the same things. 
21 Q Well, I would expect, right, it's about the same thing. So it just hasn't been 
22 something you talked with Mr. Stone about at all in the year and a half since January 6th? 
23 
24 
25 A No. 
Mr. Parrotta. Just one moment. 
[Discussion off the record.]  83 
1 The Witness. Yeah. We --we speak about, like, my issue was with my trial and 
2 how, you know --how I have all these problems out of nowhere. 
3 BY MR. 
4 Q So, just naturally, again, not having been a part of any conversations with 
5 him that you were, you didn't bring up with him, "Hey, how did you get hooked up with 
6 these guys and end up doing this and all the ramifications it had for me in my life," has he 
7 talked to you about that? 
8 
9 A 
Q No. That should be conversation, but no, I haven't had this conversation. 
How about when it comes to the Proud Boys? Are you aware of the fact 
10 that many of the Proud Boys have been --many, I should say, many Proud Boys have 
11 been charged in connection with January 6th? 
12 
13 
14 
15 A 
Q 
A 
Q Oh, yeah, obviously, now I know they were also involved. 
To include Enrique Tarrio has now been charged, are you aware of that? 
I saw that, too. 
Okay. Have you talked to Mr. Stone at all about the Proud Boys and their 
16 connection with January 6th, his views on that? 
17 
18 A 
Q No. 
How about the fact that Enrique Tarrio, specifically someone he was friendly 
19 with, has been charged in connection with that day? Have you talked to Mr. Stone 
20 about that? 
21 A No. 
22 Q Joseph Biggs and Ethan Nordean, two guys we talked about earlier that you 
23 knew of, have you talked to Mr. Stone about the fact that they were --that they've been 
24 charged in connection with January 6th, his views on that? 
25 A No.  84 
1 Q Have you had occasion to talk to Owen Shroyer about what happened with 
2 him and what he did on January 6th? 
3 A The only time I've spoken to him, I believe, in person would have been 
4 January --hello, that was basically it. 
5 Q How about Mr. Alex Jones? Same question. Have you talked to him since 
6 January 6th? 
7 
8 A No. 
Mr.- All right. Mr. Greco, I think those are all the questions I have. 
9 just want to say thank you for being willing to talk with us today. Appreciate you 
10 spending this much time. I might, as I said, have a followup question for Mr. Parrotta, if 
11 you can just look at your phone for anything in connection with Joshua James or anything 
12 kind of like that around that time, if you could just do that and let us know, but happy to 
13 hear back from you all once you've had a chance if there's anything there. 
14 But, at this point, we're done for today unless you have anything else you think we 
15 should cover that we haven't covered? 
16 
17 Mr. Parrotta. No, thank you. 
Mr. - Okay. Well, then appreciate your professionalism, both of you, 
18 and I'll be in touch. 
19 Take care. 
20 
21 
22 
23 Mr. Parrotta. Thank you, sir. 
The Witness. Thank you. 
Mr. Parrotta. Good day.
