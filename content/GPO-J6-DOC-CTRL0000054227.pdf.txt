STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS PLAN 
GIULIANI PRESIDENTIAL LEGAL DEFENSE TEAM 
We Have 10 Days To Execute This Plan & Certify President Trump! 
GOAL: Nationwide communications outreach campaign to educate the public on the fraud 
numbers, and inspire citizens to call upon legislators and Members of Congress to disregard the 
fraudulent vote count and certify the duly-elected President Trump 
TIM EU NE: Dec 27th -Jan 6th 
FOCUS OF CAMPAIGN: 
SWING STATE REPUBLICAN SENATORS-AZ, GA, Ml, NV, PA, WI 
REPULBICAN MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE 
REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF THE SENATE 
ISSUES: 
MASSIVE CORRUPTION IN THE ELECTION PROCESS LED TO A VOTE TALLY THAT IS 
FRAUDULENT 
-Dead people voted 
-Underage people voted 
-Voters who voted numerous time 
-Ineligible people voted 
o Felons 
o Illegals 
o Those who were not Indefinitely Confined as defined by law (WI) 
-Overvote -more people voted than were registered in their county- 400+% for 
example in one county 
-Vote Counting Illegalities 
o Affidavits re: witnessed piles of the same ballots being counted repeatedly 
-Fraudulent Ballots 
o Fulton County, GA, video of suitcases of fraudulent ballots 
o Affidavits re: witnesses noting pristine ballots -wrong paper type; not folded  076P-R000001891_00002 
o Affidavits re: witnesses seeing ballots being dropped at counting facilities from 
unauthorized vehicles 
Mail-in Ballots Fraud 
o No observation by Republican Officials to verify mail-in ballots' legitimacy 
11 Requirements not verified: Name, Address, Signature, Date 
o Ballots counted that did not have a security envelope 
o Ballots counted before they were requested 
o Ballots counter before thew were available or requested 
o Illegal Ballot Harvesting via the Zuckerberg Boxes and elsewhere 
Dominion Machines Fraud 
o Error rate outrageously beyond what is acceptable under FEC rules 
o Rejection rate massively beyond standard levels 
o Adjudication rate almost 100% 
o Intentional Adjudication built into the software 
11 "Adjudication" allows the machine algorithm or an Administrator to 
determine the "intent" of the voter and vote the ballot accordingly 
• Adjudication has: 
o No oversight 
o No accountability 
o No record (in many cases) 
• Coffee County, GA, Clerk has a video to show how fraud can be 
easily done through Adjudication 
o Dominion machines are live on the internet -per their own User Manual 
o Dominion machines are profoundly easy to hack 
11 VPN access 
11 No oversight over changes with USB drives 
11 Software is virtually open 
o Proven Dominion fraud in Antrim County, Ml 
11 61% Error Rate 
11 82% Rejection Rate 
11 Non-existent records for Adjudication -only for 2020 
11 Non-existent records for software security- only for 2020 
11 Non-existent records for systems files -only for 2020 
11 Votes PROVEN to have been moved throughout Central Lake Townships 
when ballots were re-run with a different software stick-VOTES 
CHANGED from the top of the ballot to the bottom 
• No explanation given to the Clerk for re-running the ballots 
• Proposition for the sale of marijuana changed from a loss to a win 
o Dominion CEO Poulos lied throughout his testimony before the Ml legislature in 
December 2020  076P-R000001891_00003 
o Dominion has a reputation for stealing elections around the world 
11 Dominion contains software from Venezuelan firm Smartmatic 
• Smartmatic was founded and financed by Hugo Chavez to control 
voting out comes in Venezuela 
• We have affidavits of witnesses who met with Maduro family 
members who said that this vote-theft technology is used to 
control his elections as well 
o Dominion is a foreign-controlled and foreign-owned company 
o Smartmatic is a foreign-controlled and foreign-owned company 
o Dominion has been decertified for use by the State of Texas 
o Dominion machines have a "poison pill" in their software that automatically 
deletes the records within the voting machines 
o Live-feeds of Dominion vote tallies show vote tallies in percentages 
Election Officials' Illegal Actions 
o Ml Secretary of State called for all Clerks to delete electronic voting data in 
violation of state law 
o No Chain of Custody for USB drives for voting machines 
o No Chain of Custody for mail-in ballots 
o No Chain of Custody for voting machines themselves 
o Election Official Ruby Freeman is seen surreptitiously & illegally handing off 
hard-drives ON CAMERA in the Georgia counting facility 
o Various Secretaries of State removed the public posting of results on their 
websites days after the election 
o Various officials have called for the destruction of ballots and/or envelopes in 
violation of record retention laws 
o Secretary of State in GA forced counties to certify their vote when they were not 
able to determine the true vote count and did not want to certify 
WHAT WORKS TO PROVE THE ELECTION NUMBERS ARE RIGHT OR WRONG 
Doing a forensic examination of the machines' software will determine if there is fraud 
Doing an analysis of the scanned images of the ballots 
o This can show: 
11 Illegal type of paper 
11 Illegal type of ink 
11 Mail-in ballots that were not folded (thus, not mailed) 
Signature verification by Al 
Envelope verification by Al 
Ballot vote counting by Al 
o Can provide a proper tally  076P-R000001891_00004 
o Can detect if the ballot was filled in by a machine (illegal) vs. by hand 
Re-running ballots through the machines to see if the tallies match 
WHAT DOES NOT WORK TO PROVE RIGHT OR WRONG VOTE COUNTS 
Hand recounts -they just recount fraudulent votes 
Signature verification by humans- very few can do this at a professional level 
Audits -they just take a percentage of total votes, and then recount the fraudulent 
votes 
Doing Nothing 
MESSAGING: 
What do you elections officials have to hide? 
Why do you not want to have an investigation into a system that is known for vote 
fraud? 
How can you guarantee that no corruption of the vote took place? 
Why are American votes being counted by servers in foreign countries? 
Why are the voting machines not secure from hacking and manipulation by employees? 
Why is there no Chain of Custody record in place for mail-in ballots? 
How can you guarantee that corruption of the vote won't take place again? 
o Especially important for the GA Senate run-off 
Legislators: 
o What are you doing to prove no fraud happened? 
o How can votes be calculated in percentages? This is a clear indication of fraud. 
o Why do you not stand with the people of your state in demanding an 
investigation? 
o How can you certify an election that has PROVEN fraud in your state? 
o Why do you not stand up for America's founding principles? 
o Why are you not exercising your plenary powers, derived from the Constitution, 
to utilize your authority to vote the electors in the way you know the people of 
your state voted? 
o Why are you defending this corruption? 
o Why are you hiding this corruption? 
Citizens: 
o You must demand accountability from your state legislators 
o You must demand they exercise their plenary power to reverse this fraud 
o You must demand a thorough investigation of this corruption 
o You must Take Back Your Country from Corruption and Corrupt Officials 
Members of Congress:  076P-R000001891_00005 
o You simply CANNOT certify electors who are represent a fraudulent vote count 
o You must vote the Will of the People 
o You must take into consideration the vast number of proven fraudulent votes 
and back those out of the reported totals 
o You simple cannot let America be stolen by a sophisticated plot to manipulate 
our vote totals by utilizing fraudulent and deceptive practices in our election 
EVERYONE: 
o YOU CANNOT LET AMERICA ITSELF BE STOLEN BY CRIMINALS -YOU MUST 
TAKE A STAND AND YOU MUST TAKE IT TODAY

• Dominion said that the machines weren't connected to the internet, but we 
have an affidavit that says it was 
• Illegals who voted -36,400 estimated by pro-immigrant group (American 
Immigration Council estimates that 276,840 illegals are in AZ) 
• Jury rolls, which would show illegals and felons, were pulled from public 
view within months of the election 
• Uniform exclusion of Republicans from meaningful observation on mail-in 
ballots and adjudication 
• 22,903 mail-in ballots received the day before the ballot was sent out 
• 2000 voters registered to a vacant lot 
• 150,000 people registered in Maricopa County after the registration 
deadline 
• 103,000 ballots in Maricopa were sent for electronic adjudication -no 
Republican observation 
• 50,000 votes loaded on ahead of the opening of the polls  076P-R000001891_00009 
GEORGIA 
Margin: 10,000 votes 
• Video of Ruby and Shay at midnight 
o That is the time of the 200,000 vote bump 
11 Similar interruptions at same time in other states 
o No Watermain Break -a lie to get the Republican observers and 
media to leave at 10:30pm 
• We are looking at machines in the Republican districts as the President ran 
3-5% behind local legislators -and they do not believe that is possible 
• Machines were connected at poll-pad and tabulator level, as we have 
testimony that the Denver help desk for Dominion worked on problems 
remotely 
• Ware County demonstrated a 13%-point reduction from Trump with 
fractional votes and assigned to Biden for a 26% differential 
• Coffee County Election Administrator shows how to manipulate cast 
ballots, change votes, and vote blank ballots as a function of the Dominion 
machine design and the electronic "Adjudication Process" 
o Coffee County could not replicate the ballot tallies after re-running 
them repeatedly, and thus did not certify their 15,000 votes 
o Gwinnett and Fulton County had a greater than 80% adjudication 
rate, where the administrator determines the voter "intent" with no 
oversight 
11 1 out of 250,000 is standard for inaccuracy 
o 2,560 felons with uncomplete sentences registered to vote and cast 
their vote; 
o 66,247 underage people registered to vote and illegally voted;

• 96,600 mail-in ballots with no return record were counted  076P-R000001891_00011

"Indefinitely Confined" Voters 
• Total is 226,000 for 2020 
• Usual is 20,000 previous -standardized list 
• No early voting -absentee voting is intentionally difficult 
• Indefinitely Confined has always been strictly administered, and was 
designed for nursing homes and home confinement 
• Secretary of State tried to expand IC to include COVID 
• WI Supreme Court ruled that COVID does not count as IC 
• Secretary of State convinced 200,000+ to claim IC status anyway 
• Court ruled again that this is illegal, and asked that those falsely claiming IC 
status be identified 
• Our team has found 1,000s of IC-claiming individuals with active lifestyles 
on FaceBook  076P-R000001891_00012 
MICHIGAN 
Margin: 147,000 votes 
• Wayne County originally rejected certifying their vote because 71% of their 
reporting precincts didn't balance -only certified after threatening & 
doxing the Republican Board of Electors Members who declined 
certification 
o This means that less than 30% of their votes were accurate 
o Even the UN would not accept this rate in a third world country 
• Antrim County forensics report 
o shows a 68% error rate (FEC legal maximum error rate is 0.0008%) 
o 81% rejection rate

retention laws requiring records to be maintained for 22 months 
• Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson sent a Board of Electors directive on 1 
December to all Country Clerks telling them to delete all electronic records 
-in violation of state law records retention

TOP 10 WORST FRAUD INCIDENTS BY STATE 
Prepared by JaNelle Cobb, TX Attorney, lawyers for Trump, as of 12/19/20 
All States with Dominion Voting Systems ("DVS"): 
Colonel Phil Waldron [state credentials] -Expert testimony and IT data for evidence of increased 
Internet traffic on (11/03/20) between US and Germany, Spain, Canada [need to confirm 
countries] and connectivity of Dominion Voting Systems to Internet. 
Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai [state credentials -MIT PhD (multiple degrees), inventor of email] -Expert 
testimony with mathematical analysis and graphs proving statistical certainty of algorithm used 
to automatically steal percentage of votes from Trump and given to Biden, emphasizing 
mathematical impossibility to have decimal point totals in a "one person, one vote" calculation. 
Stopped Count -All swing states stopped counting at approximately the same time on the night 
of Election Day (11/03/20), which correlates to time of "ballot stuffing" based on evidence and 
supports expert findings that preset algorithm in DVS machines were broken by underestimated 
large turnout of Trump voters. 
AZ, GA and PA: 
Bobby Piton [state credentials (mathematician and chartered financial analyst)] -Expert 
testimony and mathematical calculations to confirm blatant voter fraud based on incontrovertible 
evidence in statistical analyses of official government records on voter data. 
According to Twitter post, as of 12/18/20, Piton has statistical findings for AZ, GA and PA. Needs 
contact of person to perform the same for Ml and WI). 
Top 10 Worst Fraud Incidents 
ARIZONA 
1. Dominion Voting Systems -Based on results of the forensic audit of DVS machines in Antrim 
County, Michigan, the AZ state legislature obtained a subpoena for ALL DVS machines in Maricopa 
County, AZ to be confiscated and forensically audited with results due on (12/18/20). Board of 
Supervisors refused to comply and is attempting to quash subpoena to prevent the results to be 
shown to We The People, who are entitled to the results as those in authority over the Board of 
Supervisors AND the state legislatures per the US Constitution. 
Please Note -AZ state legislature may be reminded of authority via Article 11, Section 2, Clause 2 
of US Constitution to decertify votes NOW, as Board of Supervisors' refusal to comply with 
subpoena and efforts to quash are evidence of guilt, essentially an admission (as will be true if 
WHEN the machines are audited information on the machines has been deleted). 
2. "Glitches" Reported -[See: https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/11/07 /rep-gos2r--c2lls-on-­

4. Poll Challenger Exclusion -On (11/04/20), morning after Election Day, GOP (and possibly 
Independent) Poll Challengers (or Watchers depending on title in PA) were prohibited entry into 
counting location and corralled. 
5. "Sharpie Gate" -Voters told to use sharpies and not pens to ensure votes did not count.

election fraud [See: video of GA demonstration of DVS machines as evidence of intentional design 
for error rate to easily manipulate ballots in adjudication process]. 
2. Ballot Dump -On (11/04/20), at or around 4 AM the morning after Election Day, multiple 
eyewitnesses observed vans pull up and unload approximately multiple boxes of ballots, totaling 
about 138,000 ballots, all reportedly for Biden (many without down-ballot votes), which were 
placed in the tabulation machines and counted without the requisite attendance of GOP Poll 
Challengers and received AFTER the cutoff period as required by state legislature -8 PM (or 9 PM 
if include grace period) on Election Day (11/03/20).
