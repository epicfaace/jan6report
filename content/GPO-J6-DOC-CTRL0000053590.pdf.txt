Team, 
Approved, herewith, is the press release, the talking points, and the forensics 
report. Talking points obviously not to be made public -and the top key ones 
could be cut into a shorter doc to others to use. 
Needs to go to the WH. President and VP just briefed. They are thrilled. :) 
Please let me know if you need anything. LET''S GET THIS!! 
Thanks! 
Katherine
