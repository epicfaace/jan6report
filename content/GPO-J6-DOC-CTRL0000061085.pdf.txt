sure. I'm told that on the call with the Electors they were told that the Ballot form would be conditioned upon ultimaie certification by 
the Governor, indemnification by the campaign if someone gets sued or worse. (charged with something by the AG or someone 
else). and the receipt by the Electors of a legal opinion by a national firm and certified to be accurate by a Pa. lawyer. 
What was sent was a "memo" by Chesebro not addressed to the Electors, and no certification by a Pa. lawyer. To make it worse, 
Chesebro describes the Pa. plan as "dicey". And there's no indication by anyone with authority that there's any indemnification 
authorized by the Campaign.

Thanks James. 
Will Mr. Chesebro please send his opinion and the Pa. lawyer's confirmation out tonight? 
We're all getting call from concerned Electors. 
Will you be the Pennsylvania lawyer signing? 
I'll be available by cell tonight or tomorrow at- can't get to Harrisburg as I broke my right foot!

James, 
With regard to the Bectors' Certification I'd suggest that we use this version which references the ultimate certification of the 
Electors by the Governor. 
The Memo by Mr. Chesebro should be amended to address it to the Electors and I'm told that it was to be reviewed by a 
Pennsylvania attorney and signed off by him/her confirming the legitimacy of the procedure . 
Also, I've spoken to Electors who will drive to Harrisburg , remain in their car and sign the Ballot. If the Campaign doesn't think that 
works, please let me know and I'll tell those Electors to advise you that substitutes should be secured. 
Lastly, the Chair of the Electors should more appropriately be Bernie Comfort and the Secretary Ted Christian . 
Please let me know if we can proceed this way. 
Thanks, 
Tom King
