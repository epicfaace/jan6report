QUERY FROM FOX NEWS: I am writing to you and BG Hannah requesting an on the record statement 
from Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy, Gen McConville and LTG Charles Flynn by noon Eastern today in 
response to Ret Gen Michael Flynn calling for martial law and for the US military (Army) to oversee a new 
vote for the Presidential election in the swing states that President Trump lost. Given that Flynn's brother LTG 
Charles Flynn is the current U.S Army Director of Operations , Plans and Training I am including him in my 
request. My question is whether the senior leaders of the Army including LTG Flynn support or denounce ret 
Gen Flynn's call for martial law and the use of the US military to be used to hold new elections. 
FLYNN TO NEWSMAX: "There is no way in the world we are going to be able to move forward as a nation," General 
Flynn said. "[The president] could immediately, on his order, seize every single one of these machines." 
"Within the swing states," he continued, "ifhe wanted to, he could take military capabilities, and he could 
place those in states and basically rerun an election in each of those states. 
"I mean, it's not unprecedented. These people are out there talking about martial law like it's something that 
we've never done. Martial law has been instituted 64 times." 
He added: "We have a constitutional process. We clearly have a constitutional process. That has to be 
followed."
