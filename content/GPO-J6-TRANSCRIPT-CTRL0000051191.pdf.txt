2 - Good morning. 
3 This is a deposition of Jenna Ellis, conducted by the House Select Committee to 
4 Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol, pursuant to House 
5 Resolution 503. 
6 Good morning, Ms. Ellis. Could you please state your full name and spell your 
7 last name for the record? 
8 
9 The Witness. My name is Jenna Lynn Ellis. Last name, E-1-1-i-s. 
- Thankyou. 
10 This will be a staff-led deposition, and members of the select committee, of 
11 course, may choose also to join us and ask questions. 
12 As I mentioned, my name is■■■■■ I am an investigative counsel for the 
13 select committee. And also here in the room or participating virtually on staff of the 
14 select committee are_, our chief investigative counsel. Here in the room 
15 with me is_, a senior investigative counsel for the select committee. 
16 - Good morning. 
17 - Also , a member of our professional staff,_ 
18 _, investigative counsel for the committee. And I see also that Representative 
19 Raskin has joined us as well. 
20 So before we begin, I'd like to cover a few ground rules. 
21 We will follow the House deposition rules that we provided to your counsel 
22 previously and that were included with your subpoena. Under the House deposition 
23 rules, counsel for other persons or government agencies may not attend, and you are 
24 permitted to have your attorney present. 
25 Under the House rules, neither committee members, nor staff, may discuss the 3  4 
1 substance of testimony you provide today, unless the committee approves release. 
2 You and your counsel will have an opportunity to review the transcript. 
3 At this time, Counsel, could you state your appearance for the record? 
4 
5 Mr. Melito. Yes. Michael Melito on behalf of Jenna Ellis. 
- Thankyou. 
6 So, Ms. Ellis, there is an official reporter transcribing the record of this deposition. 
7 So for that reason, please wait until each question is completed before you begin your 
8 response, and we will try to wait until your responses are complete to ask our next 
9 question. 
10 The stenographer cannot record nonverbal responses, such as shaking your head, 
11 so it is important that you answer each question with an audible verbal response. 
12 We ask that you provide complete answers based on your best recollection. If 
13 the question is not clear, please ask for clarification and we'll be happy to clarify. And if 
14 you do not know the answer, please simply say so. 
15 You may only refuse to answer a question to preserve a privilege recognized by 
16 the select committee. If you refuse to answer a question based on a privilege, staff may 
17 either proceed with the deposition or seek a ruling from the chair on the objection. If 
18 the chair overrules such an objection, you will be required to answer the question. 
19 So, again, please don't hesitate to ask us to repeat a question if it's not clear, and 
20 if you need to consult with your counsel at any time during this deposition that's no 
21 problem. We can go off the record and you can mute and close your video to have a 
22 sidebar conversation in this virtual format. 
23 If you need a break at any time during this deposition, please just let us know, and 
24 we will try to take a break at a reasonable time, so that everyone doesn't get too tired 
25 here, too.  1 I also want to remind you that it is unlawful to deliberately provide false 
2 information to Congress. And since this deposition will be under oath, providing false 
3 information could result in criminal penalties for perjury and/or for providing false 
4 statements. 
5 Ms. Ellis, do you understand that? 
6 
7 The Witness. I do. Thank you. 
- Okay. Could you please stand and raise your right hand to be 
8 sworn by the court reporter? 
9 The Reporter. Do you solemnly swear and affirm under the penalty of perjury 
10 that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing 
11 but the truth? 
12 
13 
14 The Witness. I do so swear. 
The Reporter. Thank you. 
- Okay. Great. 
15 So, again, logistically please let us know if you need any breaks as we go through 
16 the process this morning. 
17 Any questions or anything to address before we get started? 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 The Witness. No, thank you. 
- Okay. Great. 
EXAMINATION 
BY-
Q Ms. Ellis, we have some documents, exhibits to the deposition, that we're 
23 going to show you today. So I'll ask Mr. Saunders, when he has a moment here, to put 
24 up exhibit 1 on the screen so you can see it. 
25 Ms. Ellis, can you see the shared screen there? 5  1 
2 
3 A 
Q I can. 
Okay. Great. 
So you understand that you are appearing pursuant to this subpoena issued to 
4 you by the select committee. Is that correct? 
5 
6 A 
Q Yes. 
Okay. A part of the subpoena required you to produce documents and 
7 information, including electronically stored information. Do you understand that 
8 obligation? 
9 
10 A 
Q 
11 subpoena? 
12 
13 A 
Q Yes. 
Have you reviewed the schedule of requests that were attached to the 
Yes. 
And did you search for records that are responsive to the subpoena as 
14 reflected in that schedule? 
15 
16 A 
Q Yes. 
Have you produced to the select committee all documents and 
17 communications in your possession, custody, or control that are responsive to the 
18 requests in the subpoena? 
19 A I have an ongoing obligation to continue to produce and have made best 
20 efforts to comply, yes. 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 Q Okay. 
Could we also put up exhibit 2, please? 
Ms. Ellis, do you recognize this document? 
A 
Q Yes. 
Okay. This is a form of certification of compliance to the subpoena that 6  7 
1 you produced to the select committee. In this letter, you noted that there are many 
2 additional documents that may be responsive to the subpoena request that are no longer 
3 in your possession, custody, or control. Can you please describe those documents for 
4 us? 
5 A Upon advice of counsel, I am invoking my constitutionally protected right to 
6 assert the Fifth Amendment. 
7 Q Right. Just to clarify, the question is directed only to the statements that 
8 you made in the certification previously provided to the committee. So are you invoking 
9 your Fifth Amendment right to refuse to answer questions regarding documents that you 
10 identified in the certification as no longer being in your possession, custody, or control? 
11 
12 A 
Q No. My certification is correct. 
Okay. Can you describe for us the efforts that you made to determine 
13 what documents you --the location of documents that you remembered being responsive 
14 to the request in the subpoena but no longer being in your possession, custody, or 
15 control? 
16 A I searched my personal emails accounts that are still in my possession, 
17 custody, or control, I searched my physical documents that are still in my possession, 
18 custody, or control, and made every effort to locate any documents, either electronic, 
19 also in my phone, for text messages, any other threads that may be contained in my 
20 personal phone. 
21 Q Okay. Great. Thank you. I'm going to ask you a few follow-up questions 
22 just to understand those categories of documents a little bit better. 
23 So you said you identified some hard copy documents, or places where you knew 
24 hard copy documents may be stored. Can you describe to us with a little bit more 
25 specificity for us, what types of hard copy documents did you search?  8 
1 A I searched any of my case file that I maintained after the conclusion of 
2 representation. 
3 Q Okay. And did that include boxes of documents, binders? In what format 
4 were they stored? 
5 
6 A 
Q In binders, in boxes. 
Okay. What about handwritten notes? Do you maintain any notebooks 
7 or other sort of repositories of handwritten notes from this time period? 
8 A I had a couple of legal pads that contained notes that I also produced on my 
9 privilege log. That would've been labeled handwritten notes. 
10 Q Okay. So all of the legal pads or handwritten notes that you searched for 
11 potentially responsive materials, those are all reflected on your privilege log, rather than 
12 documents that we received in your production? Is that correct? 
13 
14 A 
Q Handwritten notes are all on my privilege log, that is correct. 
Okay. What about other types of electronically stored or, like, stand-alone 
15 electronic documents, things maintained in Microsoft Word or Excel, those type of files, 
16 did you search any locations where those documents might be stored? 
17 A I did, yes. That would've been on my personal laptop hard drive that was 
18 also searched as well and would've been produced if responsive. 
19 Q Okay. And is this the same computer that you used during the relevant 
20 time period of the subpoena, which, just to refresh your recollection, was November 3rd, 
21 2020, through January 21st, 2021? 
22 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A 
Q It is. 
Okay. Did you have another computer during that time? 
I did not. 
Okay. Did you ever --were you ever issued a computer by the Trump  1 campaign? 
2 
3 A 
Q No, I was not. 
Okay. You mentioned that you searched some email accounts for 
4 documents that would potentially be responsive to the subpoena. Can you tell us with 
5 more specificity which email accounts you searched? 
6 A My Gmail email account and also my Thomas More Society account. Both 
7 of those are tied electronically to a repository that would be on line for my own access. 
8 Q Okay. Did you have any other email accounts during this relevant time 
9 period, other than the two that you've just identified for us? 9 
10 A I did. I had an @DonaldTrump.com account that I no longer have access to 
11 and is outside of my possession, custody, or control. 
12 Q Okay. Can you describe for us any efforts that you undertook to gain 
13 access to your emails from your @DonaldTrump email address? 
14 A Those are outside of my possession, custody, or control, and, as mentioned 
15 in my certification to the committee, I identified where those would be located, as well as 
16 the point of contact that would be best able to produce those. 
17 Q Okay. So that portion of your certification --maybe,., could you scroll 
18 down that document a little bit more? There we go. The first sentence in the third 
19 paragraph ends that you are aware that there are many additional documents that may 
20 be responsive to the select committee's request and are no longer in your possession, 
21 custody, or control. 
22 Was this the --when you added that to your certification, were you referring to 
23 your emails contained in your Donald Trump email account? 
24 A Well, as the certification continues, the next sentence --well, about two 
25 sentences later, says, "The potentially responsive additional documents of which I speak  10 
1 are likely currently in the possession of my former client, Donald J. Trump for President, 
2 Inc." 
3 Q Okay. In addition to your emails in the Donald Trump email account, are 
4 there other documents that you're referring to here that you know might have responsive 
5 materials but are no longer in your possession, custody, or control? 
6 A I'm not aware of any documents that would have been outside of my 
7 possession, custody, or control that would've been responsive to my subpoena other than 
8 my email account. 
9 
10 Q Okay. Thank you. 
You also mentioned earlier that you had searched for potentially responsive text 
11 messages. Can you identify any devices that you searched for text messages? 
12 A My personal iPhone. 
13 Q Okay. And is that the same phone that you used during the relevant time 
14 period for the subpoena? 
15 
16 
17 
18 A 
Q 
A 
Q It is. 
Did you have another phone during that time period? 
I did not. 
Did you search any other messaging applications where there might be 
19 responsive information? 
20 
21 A 
Q I searched the Signal application. 
Okay. Did you use any other messaging applications during this time 
22 period, like WhatsApp, Telegram, any others? 
23 
24 A 
Q Not that I recall, no. 
Okay. In the Signal application, did you locate any responsive information 
25 through your searches of that app?  11 
1 A Any responsive materials that would've been located were either provided 
2 to the committee or mentioned in my privilege log. 
3 Q Okay. Any other potentially responsive information that you recalled being 
4 stored in the Signal app but that was no longer available when you went to search it? 
5 
6 A 
Q I'm not sure I understand the question. 
Sure. I'm aware that Signal often has a process whereby one or more of 
7 the recipients can set a time after which an email --or a message rather --is deleted from 
8 the app. 
9 So my question is really specific to Signal. When you went to search Signal, were 
10 there any potentially responsive communications that you recalled existing on the app 
11 but that were no longer available at the time that you searched it? 
12 A Not that I specifically recall. I searched the Signal app as well as my 
13 iMessage app for anything within the relevant time periods. I'm sure that there were 
14 some Signal messages that, as you said, were deleted due to the auto delete, but nothing 
15 that I specifically recall searching for that was no longer available. 
16 Q Okay. And just generally speaking, can you describe for us your --the 
17 purpose of using Signal? 
18 A Generally speaking, it's more secure. And I've been advised by colleagues 
19 that the message end-to-end encryption is potentially more secure than iMessage. So 
20 that was my purpose for using it. 
21 Q Okay. Did you primarily use one app versus the other for communications 
22 related to your work during this time period, whether it's iMessage or Signal? 
23 A Probably I used iMessage more frequently, but I don't --I wouldn't have a 
24 percentage guess. 
25 Q Okay. Did you also search for any social media messaging that might have  12 
1 responsive information? 
2 A I looked on my Twitter account and Face book page, and since those are 
3 publicly available did not include those as responsive, but do have a list of my Twitter 
4 posts, for example, and Facebook as well. 
5 Q Oh, great. So you mentioned a list. Is that something that you compiled 
6 of potentially responsive tweets? 
7 A Not necessarily as potentially responsive, but just for my own information as 
8 to what I communicated to the public during that time. I didn't necessarily believe, in 
9 consultation with my attorney, that those were specifically responsive to the subpoena, 
10 since they're publicly available. 
11 Q Okay. That's helpful to know, to gather everything in one place. 
12 What about in the direct messaging feature of either of those apps or any other 
13 social media applications, did you have any responsive material there? 
14 
15 
16 A 
Q 
A Not that I came across, no. 
Did you search for Twitter or Facebook direct messages? 
I looked through some Twitter DMs, and those, as far as I'm aware at this 
17 time, don't have anything responsive that I haven't already provided either on my 
18 production or in the privilege log. 
19 Q Okay. And what about any other social media applications? Do you use 
20 lnstagram or Parler? 
21 
22 yes. 
23 
24 A 
Q 
A I use Parler some, I haven't recently, and I do use lnstagram for some posts, 
Okay. Did you search either of those applications? 
I did not search Parler and I did not search the DM of lnstagram. I don't 
25 generally use that very frequently.  1 Q Okay. Thank you. 
2 So other than what we've discussed so far, have you destroyed, deleted, or 
3 otherwise manipulated any documents responsive to the request described in the 
4 subpoena? 
5 
6 
7 
8 A 
Q No. 
Okay. 
_, could you please bring up exhibit 6? 
Ms. Ellis, this is the privilege log that your counsel produced to the select 
9 committee. It can be a little bit hard to read in this process. So we can scroll to the 13 
10 appropriate locations if necessary. But there are a few questions we wanted to ask you 
11 about materials that are reflected on this privilege log. 
12 So there are several individuals that were listed on the privilege log who are not 
13 attorneys and/or for whom there's no apparent confidential or attorney-client agent 
14 relationship. So we'd just like to ask you some questions to understand a little bit better 
15 the circumstances of the connection to these individuals as well as your claims of 
16 privilege or attorney work product protection. 
17 So I'm going to ask you a few --whether each of these individuals have an 
18 attorney-client relationship with the campaign, or whether they were performing work in 
19 anticipation of litigation at the direction of an attorney for the campaign. 
20 So the first name that I'd like to identify for you is Maria Ryan. Are you familiar 
21 with that name? 
22 
23 A 
Q I am. 
Okay. Was Ms. Ryan --did Ms. Ryan have an attorney-client relationship 
24 with the Trump campaign? 
25 A Pursuant to advice of my counsel, I'll invoke my constitutionally protected  14 
1 right to assert the Fifth Amendment. 
2 Q What about Mark Meadows, who's reflected on this privilege log? 
3 Mr. Meadows was not an attorney. He was acting at --he was at the time the White 
4 House chief of staff. Was Mr. Meadows performing work in anticipation of litigation at 
5 the direction of an attorney for the Trump campaign? 
6 A Pursuant to advice of counsel, I'll invoke my constitutionally protected right 
7 to assert the Fifth Amendment. 
8 Q Okay. One more. What about Steve Bannon, who's a name that is 
9 reflected on this privilege log? Was Mr. Bannon performing work at the direction of a 
10 lawyer for the Trump campaign? 
11 A Pursuant to advice of counsel, I will invoke my constitutionally protected 
12 right to assert the Fifth Amendment. 
13 Q Ms. Ellis, there's a name on this privilege log, the document identifier is 
14 number 7612 --or, forgive me, 7614. The name is reflected on the log as just Ali, A-I-i. 
15 Can you identify for us who that individual is? 
16 A Pursuant to advice of counsel, I will invoke my constitutionally protected 
17 right to assert the Fifth Amendment. 
18 
19 - Ms. Ellis, is that person Ali Alexander? 
The Witness. Pursuant to advice of counsel, I will invoke my constitutionally 
20 protected right to assert the Fifth Amendment. 
21 - Did you have communications with Ali Alexander during the time 
22 period of November of 2020? 
23 The Witness. Pursuant to advice of counsel, I will assert my constitutionally 
24 protected right to the Fifth Amendment. 
25 BY  15 
1 Q A little bit farther down this privilege log, for example, the document that is 
2 identified by number 7790, there's a name that appears, Doug Mastriano. 
3 Is Mr. Mastriano a lawyer or otherwise acting at the direction of a lawyer for the 
4 Trump campaign? 
5 A Pursuant to advice of counsel, I will invoke my constitutionally protected 
6 right to assert the Fifth Amendment. 
7 Q Ms. Ellis, is the Doug Mastriano that you're referring to in this privilege log 
8 the same individual that is a State senator in the State of Pennsylvania? 
9 A Pursuant to advice of counsel, I will invoke my constitutionally protected 
10 right to assert the Fifth Amendment. 
11 Q Just below that entry, a document with the identifier number 7834, there is 
12 a text message communication between yourself and Eric Trump. It has been withheld 
13 from production not only under the work product doctrine but also as a privileged 
14 attorney-client communication. 
15 Was Eric Trump a client of yours during this time period? 
16 A Pursuant to advice of counsel, I will invoke my constitutionally protected 
17 right to assert the Fifth Amendment. 
18 BY-: 
19 Q Ms. Ellis, I want to go back to the Doug Mastriano references. I see there's 
20 a few of them on the privilege log. 
21 Was Mr. Mastriano a client of yours at any time? 
22 A Pursuant to advice of counsel, I'll invoke my constitutionally protected right 
23 to assert the Fifth Amendment. 
24 Q I can see that, according to the privilege log, there's a text message on 
25 November 25th saying that --and the entry says that it was discussing internal legal  16 
1 strategy for possible pending litigation. 
2 What litigation strategy were you discussing with Mr. Mastriano on November 
3 25th, 2020? 
4 A Pursuant to advice of counsel, I will invoke my constitutionally protected 
5 right to assert the Fifth Amendment. 
6 Q I can see on November 27th, Mr. Mastriano was part of a group text 
7 discussion, it appears, with Bill Bock and Mike Jones and yourself, also to discuss internal 
8 legal strategy. 
9 What legal strategy were you discussing with Mr. Mastriano on November 27th, 
10 2020? 
11 A Pursuant to advice of counsel, I will invoke my constitutionally protected 
12 right to assert the Fifth Amendment. 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 Q There's also a text message, apparently on November --also on November 
27th, involving you, Mr. Mastriano, and someone with the telephone number 
also to discuss legal strategy. 
What legal strategy were you discussing with those two individuals on November 
27th? 
A Pursuant to advice of counsel, I'll invoke my constitutionally protected right 
19 to assert the Fifth Amendment. 
20 - Great. I'd just like to note for the record, that Representative 
21 Kinzinger has joined us as well. 
22 Ms. Ellis, and a couple more questions about this privilege log. There's an entry 
23 with, for example, a document number that begins 9 --7981. This is a text --described 
24 as a text message discussion of internal legal strategy for possible pending litigation. 
25 Included in that group text message, in addition to yourself, are two individuals, Jay  17 
1 Sekulow and Eric Herschmann. 
2 Can you tell us what role Mr. Sekulow and Mr. Herschmann played for the Trump 
3 campaign? 
4 The Witness. Pursuant to advice of counsel, I'll invoke my constitutionally 
5 protected right to assert the Fifth Amendment. 
6 BY-: 
7 Q Ms. Ellis, on November 24th there's a, looks like, a group text between you, 
8 Boris Epshtyn, and Alex Bruesewitz involving legal strategy for Wisconsin. 
9 Can you tell us what --whether you had an attorney-client relationship with Alex 
10 Bruesewitz? 
11 A Pursuant to advice of counsel, I will invoke my constitutionally protected 
12 right to assert the Fifth Amendment. 
13 
14 Q 
A Is he a lawyer? 
Pursuant to advice of counsel, I will assert my constitutionally protected 
15 right to invoke the Fifth Amendment. 
16 Q What discussions were you having with Mr. Epshtyn and Mr. Bruesewitz 
17 regarding legal strategy on November 24th, 2020? 
18 A Pursuant to advice of counsel, I will invoke my constitutionally protected 
19 right to assert the Fifth Amendment. 
20 -· Ms. Ellis, there's another text message communication on your log 
21 with the identifier 7847. It's a group text message from November 21st, 2020. The 
22 participants in that text message, as reflected on your privilege log are yourself, Andrew 
23 Giuliani, Peter Navarro, and Joanna Miller. 
24 What relationship did Andrew Giuliani, Peter Navarro, and Joanna Miller have 
25 with the Trump campaign?  18 
1 The Witness. Pursuant to advice of counsel, I will invoke my constitutionally 
2 protected right to assert the Fifth Amendment. 
3 ~ Were Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Navarro, or Ms. Miller acting as attorneys for 
4 the Trump campaign or at the direction of attorneys for the Trump campaign at this time? 
5 The Witness. Pursuant to advice of counsel, I will invoke my constitutionally 
6 protected right to assert the Fifth Amendment. 
7 - I'll pause here to see if anyone else has any other questions about 
8 the privilege log before we move on. 
9 - Ms. Ellis, actually, I think --if you can just tell us, are you --do you 
10 intend to assert your Fifth Amendment rights to any questions that we ask you about 
11 details of this privilege log that you've produced? 
12 The Witness. Pursuant to advice of counsel, yes, I do intend to invoke my 
13 constitutionally protected right to the Fifth Amendment to any substantive questions. 
14 
15 
16 - Thankyou. 
BY-: 
Q Okay. Ms. Ellis, did you communicate by text message during the relevant 
17 time period for the subpoena with Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff? 
18 A Pursuant to advice of counsel, I will invoke my constitutionally protected 
19 right to assert the Fifth Amendment. 
20 Q Earlier, when we were discussing the locations where you searched for 
21 material potentially responsive to the subpoena, you identified a personal iPhone, I 
22 believe it was, that cell phone that you used during this time period and that you still 
23 have access to. I won't identify the whole number, but is that the phone number with 
24 the last four digits-? 
25 A Yes, it is.  19 
1 Q Okay. And is that the same phone number associated with the iMessage 
2 account that you told us a few minutes ago that you searched for material responsive to 
3 the subpoena? 
4 
5 A 
Q Yes, it is. 
So we're aware of at least 350 text messages between you and 
6 Mr. Meadows between November 3rd, 2020, and January 13th, 2021. However, it looks 
7 like your privilege log reflects only 35 of those text messages. Can you explain why that 
8 might be? 
9 A Pursuant to advice of counsel, I will invoke my constitutionally protected 
10 right to assert the Fifth Amendment. 
11 Q Did you not produce these text messages with Mark Meadows because you 
12 determined that every text message between you and Mark Meadows was either an 
13 attorney-client privilege communication or a confidential communication prepared in
