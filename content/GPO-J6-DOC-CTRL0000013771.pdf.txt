Yes x are you at the warehouse tomorrow? 
Hey! 
Wasna€'Mt planning on it. I was there yesterday and today. la€'MII be there all day Thursday. 
x we have a large event on the 6th in de ith a two day build and have PS to deal with. was going to ask if ou were able to come into king street office and put together a production/buildout schedule for us. 
wea€'"re managing the entire build which includes all the vendors from main stage, audio, video, lighting, sound, turf, tables tents chairs and so on. have all the vendors secured but my time is being pulled soi wanted to make sure we had a detailed schedule of what 
x needs to come when. 
Copy that. Not sure la€'Mm the best at that, but would be happy to give it a shot. la€'"m just concerned once I ask you all of the questions -youa€'Mre coming to think you shoulda€'Mve just done it yourself:) 
x Are you in the office tomorrow? Time? Address to office? 
x Sorry to text so late but I wanted to send this while I was thinking about it. Youa€'Mre handling the VIP tent setup. I had planned on stocking it (water, snacks, etc). Should I still plan to do that? 
x yes that would be great! 
x And la€'MII share the Google spread sheet with you that has the speakers from the three locations. la€'Mve spoken with the organizers from each of them and complied their list into one with the schedule theya€'Mve shared with those speaking. 
x Approximate number for the VIP tent? 
x I was planning for just my event now la€'"II plan for the entire day. 
x Just checking in to see how everything is going. 
x he . all is going well. we think wea€'Mre in a good spot. been in back to backs all day getting the loose ends identified and on paper. 
x I just need direction on graphics and what else la€'Mm managing. I had planned everything to go to print tomorrow. Caroline indicated we needs approval on the name and graphic 
x Is that something youa€'Mre taking over or am I still managing that. 
x Do you have a minute to get on a call? la€'Mm trying to understand everything that is going on. 
x i am just walking into a dinner. will be tied up until 9ish. leta€'"s schedule for the AM and we can debrief. 
x Ok 
xx E street is closed 
x this event on the 6th has grown to $600k and a five day build out. 
hey sorry ia€'Mve been on the phone all morning. 
x i would prefer you come in as this ellipse project is growing substantially and i need you to work closely with me on site diagrams and management. this will be a supplemental paying job as well. will compensate you on a day rate thru esi. $300/day.

Did the guy estimate how long to install the flooring? At this point, I have them down for 8hrs. That is 9:30p-6p. So mobile stage 6p-8p.

Ok. 
I locked in lights and power for lights. 
x la€'MII ping him about lifts and the guys 
x I just got my ass chewed by NPS. 
x ia€'Mm about to get on a call with them regarding production will call you afterwards. 
x Ok. I need security vehicle permission for the 6th. We have to talk after. 
x You need to relinquish the permits for free om plaza for women for America First 
x Hey Justin it's Kim. Working on the invoice for you and will send along with ACH in a bit. Thanks for sending the diagram 
x Justin do we know the general area for the entrance we are going to advise 
x TPUSA is working on some mapping 
x I am assuming we cana€'Mt sell things or that would make things more complicated. Ace specialties does our stuff 
Did anyone miss that this is a difficult timeline on the ellipse? 
x I wasna€'"t sure if that was clear. 
Just one concern that can be addressed later today .. in regards to the website. We would like TrumpMarch.com to be the primary source of all information. We are obviously can have you guys handle, but our web team is awesome and well qualified (the Liberty lab). 
x lta€'Ms also what everyone has been directed to for the previous events from 11/14 & 12/12. Anyways, we can discuss later as ita€'Ms lower on the priority list but just wanted to put that on your radar. 
x please let caroline know that. we have SaveAmericaMarch as a website. we really like the save america branding 
X You got it oY'oY» 
I need to get clarity on whata€'Ms going on on the 6th. I have my contracted security guys saying that the Kremera€'"s security person, Zach, is attempting to get him to come under them for the 6th. I was told specifically that I would be handling the security for those 
days and have already secured my team. Please let me know what exactly I am supposed to be doing. 
I have dozens of speakers and people who have an expectation based on the work I have done for two weeks for this. I have gone out of my way to bring people who donai:'"t work together normally to work together. And now I am not even sure if I will get the permits 
x for the 5th because I cana€'Mt get the Kremera€'Ms to pull the application I filed that they claimed was theirs even though theya€'Mre not using it. Please clarify before I start making my deposits for vendors. 
hey. can you please work with your legal team to amend the permit to include saturday and sunday? 
x the flooring is going to take a while to get in soi want to provide ample time. 
x Yes, is that possible since it is a holiday? I will get them on it right now 
x i gave marissa a heads up. 
x Okay what times starting and ending 
x i would put the same times as you did on the last ones 6a -9p 
x Perfect 
x one additional item a€" i ill be submitting an agreement letter and invoice for deposit to omen for america first tonight. letting you kno so e can set up the ire to initiate in the A before 10am as banks ill begin closing 
x Perfect 
x To confirm -start date 1/2/2021 at 9am to 1/6/2021 at 9am for set up?

x Hi Justin any updates? Are you going with our flooring?Dwain 
x Hey Justin, hope all is well. Just emailed you a contract question for Dalton, GA. Any chance you can look at that this afternoon? Thanks 
I have my second meeting with NPS this morning at 9am. As of 5:00pm last night I have not received confirmation from them that the initial permit application I filed has not been relinquished. I plan to keep my appointment with them, however, when I get on this call, if 
those have not been pulled I wona€'Mt be continuing with the planning process. Based on my experience with the Kremera€'Ms not acting in good faith, I will not continue to plan an event they ultimately have control over being the permit holder. I understand that this 
may be confusing to you or you may not feel ita€'Ms a big deal, but as the person who has planned the last two events for them, I can assure you it is. They have shown themselves to be self serving, dishonorable, and duplicitous and I wona€'"t subject the numerous 
x speakers that I secured and paid for, to their indecisive. 
x As far as press team goes a€" we can safe money and la€'MII do it with Wh team 
x We can handle it 
x Save* 
x When do you expect to have some kind of guest guidance set? 
x maybe sunday. waiting for secret service to officially get involved 
x now that potus tweeted were in a good spot to get assigned 
wants to help anyway he can. Can you use him? He asked me for your number so he can call you to ask. 
x Hea€'Ms still on campign payroll so not looking for money 
x Copy. If main event is at the Ellipse, Lincoln, or Freedom ... would love to be of service. Keep me posted 
Hey Justin! 
x Wea€'Mre you able to secure the curb lane of Constitution for tomorrow? 
x hey working on it now 
x Sounds good. Assuming that happens, I dona€'Mt need to make the trip down today. Let me know. Thanks! 
x do you know how long youa€™11 need on sunday to complete? 
x Dra ing received. Cre and I ill see you at 7am ! 
x Hey Caroline -potus just tweeted that hea€™s going to speak at 11am. Leta€'Ms get on the phone later to discuss how that impacts the speakers 
Happy New Year!!

x Did potus say hea€'"s leading the parade!? 
x hes wrapping 
x hey you good? safe and sound? 
x Ya la€'Mm bunkered down in the willard 
x you need an evacuation or anything? i can come get you in my car. 
x Awww youa€'Mre the sweetest. It seems like things have died down although someone just told me that a person got stabbed outside trump hotel which is crazy because I had just walked from trump to willarc 
x yeah all seemed quite. we got kicked off ellipse for curfew soi just drove home. not many ppl out. 
x Is the WH pissed 
x theya€'Mre super happy with rally. 
x Ya I mean the rally was amazing 
x la 'Mm convinced it as antifa that broke into the Capitol 
i think that is a high possibility. 
x also why the fuckkkk doesna€'"t the capitol have more industrial glass. these ppl broke single pane windows with a 2x4 lol 
x how were they not prepared at all. 
This is what I texted my mom lol 
My takes: 
2) 200,000+ people gathered in DC today for a highly publicized a€ceMarch to Save Americaa€ that the DC police and national park service essentially ignored and believed a€cemaybe 15,000a€ would show up. They were so unbelievably unprepared for this and it is 
shocking and horrifying. When BLM protested in DC, and a similar number of people showed up, they essentially had an entire militia guarding the Capitol. https://twitter.com/oliviamunn/status/1346933669869481986?s=21. But today, when they knew every MOC and 
the Vice President would be making a highly publicized vote in the Capitol while hundreds of thousands of people descended on the city, they had minimal Capitol police in place. It is truly shocking. Not to mention, WTF is this 
https ://twitter. co m/ji ha n b it/status/13469094636603965 50?s=2 l. 
Additionally, when Antifa and BLM organized protests vastly more violent and destructive than anything we saw today, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris helped to raise bail money for them. This is the necessary context in which to understand their selective moral 
indignation over todaya€'Ms events. 
3) I was at the rally today and every single person I met was peaceful, families, pastors, mom, kids, etc. I am fairly convinced that the initial a€cesiegea€ upon the Capitol was made by antifa dressed up as trump supporters to incite chaos and a media narrative. 
https://twitter.com/jackposobiec/status/1346941059905978369?s=21. But having said that, clearly several trump supporters followed them inside which was obviously wrong and they should be prosecuted for trespassing. But Capitol police shot and killed an unarmed 
16 year older female trump supporter tonight. Where is the outrage about that? Can you imagine if they had shot an unarmed 16 year old African American at a BLM protest? The whole city would !be burning to the ground. Again, there were over 300,000 people here 
and from what I can tel140 thugs broke in to the Capitol. Everyone else was completely peaceful 
x ia€'Mm just leaving the site per curfe . ia€'Mm ell. tired. sore. and disappointed at hat happened at the capitol. 
x but incredibly happy with how large our rally was. 
x No problem. Thank you guys. Chuck has the fork key. 
x press riser 
x Youa€'Mre still at the site? Why 
x we have to break it all down. 
x All good with Bike Rack 
x hey. yes ia€'Mm good. just wrapping up securing the event site to finish strike tomorrow. 
x Kylie said she needs you. Going back stage 
x Can you come to the fence 
x Crazy 
x i like the acrylic podium. :( 
x I dona€' t like seeing peoples legs

Made it...an a hour after that deal happened at the Capitol. My daughter and I were able to walk straight to the Capitol, with no issue. Passed many Trump supporters as they were walking away. No bad attitudes. No way could they have broke up a crows that massive 
and easily if the people were as the fake news media says. Dems nail in the coffin is what that was. Hope not. Shame on all the Republicans that were not strong enough to stand up for what is right. Pence, no words ... unfortunately, the Republican Party lost alot of votes 
and respect. 
Sorry for long text. 
x hey. i'm doing fine. overall pretty disgusted and disappointed over what transpired at the capitol. i feel like everything we've done has been wiped out. thanks for checking in
