3 Well, let's go on the record then. 
Today is February 23rd, 2022. And the time is 10 a.m. We're virtually 
4 convened for the deposition of Mr. Ed Martin to be conducted by the House Select 3 
5 Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol. My name 
6 is I am the designated select committee staff counsel for this 
7 proceeding. 
8 For the record, it is 10 a.m., and Mr. Martin is not present. The person

11 On February 2nd, 2022, Chairman Bennie Thompson issued a subpoena to 
12 Mr. Martin to produce documents by February 16th, 2022, and to testify at a deposition 
13 today, February 23rd, 2022, at 10 a.m. The subpoena is in connection with the select 
14 committee's investigation into the facts, circumstances, and causes of the January 6th 
15 attack and issues relating to the peaceful transfer of power in order to identify and 
16 evaluate lessons learned and to recommend to the House and its relevant committees 
17 corrective laws, policies, procedures, rules, or regulations. 
18 This inquiry includes examination of how various individuals, to include 
19 Mr. Martin, and entities coordinated their activities leading up to the events of 
20 January 6th, 2021. Mr. Martin has not produced any documents or appeared to testify 
21 today. 
22 I will mark as exhibit 1 and enter into the record the select committee subpoena 
23 to Mr. Martin, included with which are the materials that accompany the subpoena: 
24 namely a letter from the chairman, a document schedule of the accompanying 
25 production instructions, and a copy of the deposition rules.  4
