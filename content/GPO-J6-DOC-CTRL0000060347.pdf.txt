RE: General Election Irregularities in Pennsylvania during the November 2020 cycle 
Dear Honorable Donoghue: 
Election fraud is real and prevalent in Pennsylvania. Yet, despite evidence, our Governor and Secretary 
of State inexplicably refuse to investigate. Every legal vote must count. Our Republic cannot long endure 
without free and fair elections where each person has one legal vote. However, allegations of fraudulent 
activity, as well as violations of election law in 2020 have placed the nation's eyes upon this Commonwealth. 
Several of the key findings are delineated below: 
1. Senate Majority Policy Committee November hearing review on statistical anomalies, such as hundreds 
of thousands of votes being dumped into a processing facility, with 570,000 Vice President Biden, and 
only 3,200 for President Trump (https://policy.pasenategop.com/112520/). 
Testimony provided at a Senate hearing from witnesses in Philadelphia, Northampton, Luzerne, 
Montgomery, Allegheny and Delaware counties detailed instances of: 
(a) Interference with poll watchers' ability to perform functions as provided for in the state 
election code, specifically regarding the submission, review and canvasing of mail-in ballots; 
(b) Delayed opening or closing of polling locations on Election Day; 
(c) Improper forfeiture and spoiling of mail-in ballots; 
( d) Illegal ballot harvesting; 
( e) Improper "curing" of insufficiently completed mail-in ballots;  076P-R000003749_0002

(f) Poll worker intimidation and harassment; 
(g) Voter intimidation; 
(h) Improper chain of custody of ballots and election materials; 
(i) Submission of fraudulent ballots by an individual other than the named voter. 
2. There is a massive VOTER DEFICIT in Pennsylvania. 205,122 more votes were counted than total 
number of voters who voted: A comparison of official county election results to the total number of 
voters who cast ballots November 3, 2020 ... as recorded by the Department of State ... shows the 
difference of 205,122 more votes cast than voters actually voting. (Rep Frank Ryan, 
http://www.repfrankryan.com/News/18754/Latest-News/PA-Lawmakers-Numbers-Don%E2%80%199t­
Add-Up,-Ce1tification-of-Presidential-Results-Premature-and-In-Error). 
3. Unidentified Voters: When anyone registers to vote online or by paper, two options are provided for 
gender: Male or Female. If left blank; gender defaults to "No" -leaving three types of voters: Male, 
Female and "No." However, there are four genders in state voter rolls: Male, Female, "No" and 
Unidentified. It has been estimated that there are 121,000 "non-female/male voters" on state voter rolls, 
and 90,000 voted in 2020. Initial assessments have concluded that at least 1/3 of these "U" voters are 
fraudulent (Unident(fied "U" Voters, Kathy Barnette for Congress); (Unident~ed "U" Voters, Kathy 
Barnette for Congress); 
4. The mandate by Governor Wolflast year, requiring new voting machines for 2020 raised concerns from 
county officials and state lawmakers. As a result, 14 counties are using Dominion voting machines. The 
counties using Dominion voting equipment ( 1.3 million voters in Pennsylvania ): York, Erie, 
Montgomery, Bedford, Armstrong, Carbon, Crawford, Clarion, Fayette, Luzerne, Fulton, Jefferson, Pike 
and Warren." ("As Pennsylvania Counties Ring in the New year with New Voting Machines, Pressure 
from Election Security Advocates Remains," The PLS Reporter, 0I/06/2020; 
https://www.pennlive.com/politics/2018/12/ county-commissioners-guestion-the-funding-the-timing-the­
need-for-replacing-voting-machines.html; Questions Abound Over New Voting Machines, Citizens' 
Voice, 03/22/2019; https://whyy.org/articles/despite-gop-obiections-wolf-moves-to-upgrade-voting­
machines-unilaterally/; As Wo(f Administration Pushes to Replace All Voting Machines by 2020, 
Lawmakers and County Officials Question Rush and Expense, PA Watchdog, 03/29/2019). 
5. Statistical experts examined Pennsylvania voting records and reached conclusions indicating there are 
"major statistical aberrations" in state voting records that are "unlikely to occur in a normal setting;" 
eleven counties (Montgomery, Allegheny, Chester, Bucks, Delaware, Lancaster, Cumberland, 
Northampton, Lehigh, Dauphin, York) showed "distinctive signs of voting abnormalities" for Vice 
President Biden. These analyses "provide scientific evidence that the reported results are highly 
unlikely to be an accurate reflection of how Pennsylvania citizens voted." (Pennsylvania 2020 Voting 
Analysis Report, 11 II 6/2020). 
6. Gettysburg Senate Hearing -On November 25, Senator Doug Mastriano, together with Senator David 
Argall, hosted the Senate Majority Policy Committee hearing in Gettysburg where hours of testimony 
were presented, reviewed, and vetted regarding voting fraud and violations of voting law in 
Pennsylvania. The hearing demonstrated that there is rampant election fraud in Pennsylvania that must 
be investigated, remedied and rectified. The purpose of the hearing was to find out what happened in  076P-R000003749_0003

AG Donoghue 
Pennsylvania in the aftermath of hearing allegations from thousands of people from across the 
Commonwealth sharing stories of violations of election law and other infringements of voting law 
related to the November 03, 2020 general election. We heard eyewitness testimony from citizens who 
experienced their rights being violated. Additionally, during the hearing, expert witnesses testified to 
statistical anomalies, where massive quantities of ballots arrived without a chain of custody. In one 
such spike, dose to 600k votes were dumped in a processing facility with 570k of these votes going 
for Biden, and a paltry 3,200 for President Trump. Another witness testified that an election worker 
was plugging flash drives into voting machines in a heavily democrat area, for no stated purpose. 
Other irregularities included in the testimony presented at the hearing included: 
(a) Mail-in ballots were not inspected by Republican representatives in portions of Philadelphia and 
Allegheny County; 
(b) Montgomery County was never provided with guidelines from State Department Secretary about 
"curing" defective ballots; 
(c) Timeline spikes depict more ballots being processed during specific periods than voting 
machines are capable of tabulating; 
(d) The Philadelphia Board of Elections processed hundreds of thousands of mail-in ballots with 
zero civilian oversight. 
( e) Ballots were separated from envelopes in numerous precincts; a recount is useless because the 
votes cannot be verified; 
(f) Observers were corralled behind fencing in Philadelphia, at least 10 feet away from processors; 
similarly, in Allegheny County, observers were placed at least 15 feet away; 
(g) Mail-in ballots were already opened in portions of Allegheny County; no one observed the 
opening of these ballots; 
(h) Illegal "pop-up" election sites developed, where voters would apply, receive a ballot and vote; 
(i) Forensic evidence in Delaware County has disappeared; 
(j) A poll watcher with appropriate certificates and clearances was denied access; 
(k) There was no meaningful observation of ballots in Montgomery County, and no signature 
verification, as well; 
(1) A senior citizen voted for President Trump, but it was not displayed on receipt; 
(m) Election workers illegally pre-canvased ballots in Northampton County; no meaningful canvas 
observation was permitted;  076P-R000003749_0004

(n) several voters from across the state went to vote in person but when they arrived, they were told 
"they already voted" and were turned away and could not actually vote or were able to fill out a 
provisional ballot but was it really counted? 
Despite the mounting evidence, our Governor and Secretary of State decline to investigate these serious 
allegations. 
The United States of America has spent millions of dollars and put her men and women in ham1's way 
to oversee safer, more reliable and freer elections in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kosovo and Bosnia. Why is the very 
state where the light ofliberty was lit in 1776 is unable or unwilling to have elections as free and safe as war­
torn Afghanistan? Something is seriously wrong in this Commonwealth and unless this is corrected, our 
republic cannot long endure. 
The odyssey of PA finding itself in this position began in early 2020. Using the COVID-19 pandemic as 
a pretense, the Wolf Administration, together with the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, threw voting law into 
disarray. 
The General Assembly (State House and State Senate) are constitutionally responsible for writing 
election law, not Gov Wolf, Secretary of Secretary Boockvar or the PA Supreme Court. These altered the 
original meaning of key provisions of Act 77. The state Supreme Court and Secretary Boockvar fundamentally 
altered and unconstitutionally rewrote the original meaning of key provisions of Act 77. 
Voting law, as passed by the General Assembly in 2019, was clear and specific: 
• All mail-in ballots must be received by 8 p.m. on Election Day; 
• Officials at polling locations must authenticate the signatures of voters; 
• County Boards of Elections can conduct pre-canvasing of absentee and mail-in ballots after 8 a.m. on 
Election Day; 
• Defective absentee and mail-in ballots shall not be counted; and 
• "Watchers" selected by candidates and political parties are permitted to observe the process of 
canvasing absentee and mail-in ballots. 
The corruption of our election began with Governor Wolf during the COVID crisis. Wolf urged mail in 
voting upon people with a campaign to perpetuate the dangers of COVID. Likewise, he inferred that polling 
stations would be closed or undermanned due to the risk of the virus. 
But the coup de main was seven weeks before Election Day, where the PA Supreme Court unilaterally -
and in direct contravention of the wording of election law -extended the deadline for mailed ballots to be 
received from Election Day, to three days later. Similarly, the court declared that ballots mailed without a 
postmark must be counted. Additionally, the court mandated that mail-in ballots lacking a verified signature be 
accepted.  076P-R000003749_0005

AG Donoghue 
On the eve of Election Day, the State Department encouraged some counties -but not all -to notify 
party and candidate representatives of mail-in voters, whose ballots contained disqualifying defects, thereby 
enabling voters to cure said defects. This was unprecedented as it had never happened before in our 
Commonwealth. Election law is very specific to the way defects of mail-in ballots are to be treated, and it 
provides no authority for county officials to contact campaigns, or other political operatives, to affect the cure 
of such defects. 
Actions taken by the PA State Supreme Court and Secretary Boockvar in the 2020 general election were 
so fraught with inconsistencies, improprieties and irregularities that the results for the office of President of the 
United States cannot be determined in our state. 
This election is an embarrassment to our nation. John Adams rightly said that, "Facts are stubborn 
things," and armed with this, as Jesus stated, "We shall know the truth and the truth shall set us free." What 
happened on November 3, 2020 must be immediately addressed using facts and the testimony of the good 
people of our state. 
DM/kms Sincerely, 
~~ 
Senator Doug Mastriano
