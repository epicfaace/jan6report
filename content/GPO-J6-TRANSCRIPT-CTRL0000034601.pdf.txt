21 peaceful transition of power, in order to identify and evaluate lessons learned, and to 
22 recommend to the House and its relevant committees corrective laws, policies,

14 In sum and substance, the email exchange reflects as follows: 
15 On September 28th, contacted Ms. Chafian via email to ask whether 
16 she would accept service of the subpoena via email. Ms. Chafian responded and

18 securing counsel.

21 Chafian responded at 5:44 p.m., quote, "Received," end quote. 
22 Eight days later, on October 7th, emailed Ms. Chafian to inquire

24 Six days after that, on October 13th, at approximately 10:06 a.m. --that is, after 
25 the deadline to produce documents pursuant to the subpoena - again  6 
1 emailed Ms. Chafian to inquire whether she had dropped documents off at the location

3 Ms. Chafian responded at 10:29 a.m. that she had not produced documents and 
4 that she had not yet retained an attorney. She also requested an extension of 
5 unspecified length.

7 production deadline until October 18th, 2021, at 10:00 a.m. - also explained 
8 that this extended deadline was not contingent on Ms. Chafian retaining an attorney and 
9 invited Ms. Chafian or her counsel to call to discuss whether any further extension of the 
10 deadline would be necessary as a reasonable scheduling accommodation. The email 
11 also emphasized that the October 28th deposition was still scheduled to go forward. 
12 On October 18th, at approximately 12:44 p.m., -again emailed Ms. 
13 Chafian after the extended deadline for documents had passed and the select committee 
14 staff had not received any documents. -also reminded Ms. Chafian that the 
15 October 28th deposition was still scheduled and advised Ms. Chafian or her attorney to 
16 reach out to discuss logistics for her appearance. 
17 In summary, Ms. Chafian did not respond to October 18th email. 
18 Finally, I will mark as exhibit 3 and enter into the record an email from 
19 to Ms. Chafian sent Monday, October 25th, 2021, at approximately 12:53 p.m., as well as 
20 an attachment thereto.

24 letter from Chairman Thompson and notes that her deposition is still on schedule for 
25 October 28th. He also notes having left Ms. Chafian several voice mails regarding  7 
1 logistics for the deposition and asks for a return call. 
2 In sum and substance, the attached letter from Chairman Thompson to Ms. 
3 Chafian summarizes the email exchange included in exhibit 2 and notes Ms. Chafian's 
4 failure to produce documents by the extended deadline on October 18th, 2021. 
5 The chairman's letter explains Ms. Chafian remains under a legal obligation to 
6 produce documents called for in the subpoena and to appear for a deposition on 
7 October 28th at 10:00 a.m. The letter also warns Ms. Chafian of the consequences of 
8 willful noncompliance, including a potential invocation of contempt of Congress 
9 procedures outlined by Title 2 of the United States Code, Sections 192 and 194, or a civil 
10 action seeking enforcement of the subpoena. 
11 I will note for the record that the time is now 10:06 a.m. and Ms. Chafian still has 
12 not appeared or communicated to the select committee that she will appear today as 
13 required by the subpoena. 
14 Accordingly, the record is now closed as of 10:06 a.m.
