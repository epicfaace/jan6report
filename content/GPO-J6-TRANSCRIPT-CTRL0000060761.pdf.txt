3 We'll go on the record at 2:07 p.m. Eastern Time. 
So good afternoon. This is a transcribed interview of Mr. John Douglas Wright 3 
4 conducted by the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the 
5 United States Capitol pursuant to House Resolution 503. 
6 At this time, I'd ask the witness to please state your full name and spell your last 
7 name for the record, please. 
Mr. Wright. John D. Wright, W-r-i-g-h-t. 
Thank you, Mr. Wright. 8 
9 
10 So this will be a staff-led interview, and members, of course, may also choose to 
11 ask questions. However, there are no congressional members present at this time. 
In the room today, we have 
investigative counsel. We have , who's me, I'm_, I'm an 
, also an investigative counsel. We 12 
13 
14 have , who's an investigative counsel. And we have-
15 _, an investigator. 
16 As I just stated, there are no members present. 
17 At this time, could counsel please state their name for the record? 
18 Mr. Munyer. Attorney Noah Christian Munyer, Akron, Ohio, Ohio bar lawyer, 
19 Federal lawyer in Northern District and District of Columbia, 0086575. 
20 Thank you, Mr. Munyer. 
21 There is an official reporter transcribing the record of this interview today, so 
22 please wait until each question is completed before you begin your response, and we will 
23 try to wait until your response is complete before we ask our next question. 
24 The stenographer cannot record nonverbal responses such as shaking your head, 
25 so it's important that you answer each question with an audible, verbal response. If I  4 
1 see you shaking your head, don't worry about it, I'll just annotate it for the record, either 
2 seeing a positive response or a negative response from the witness, that way the record is 
3 clear. 
4 We ask that you provide complete answers based on your best recollection. If 
5 the question is not clear, just ask one of us for a clarification. And if you do not know 
6 the answer, please simply say so. 
7 You may only refuse to answer a question to preserve a privilege recognized by 
8 the select committee, and such privileges including the Fifth Amendment privilege against 
9 compulsory self-incrimination. 
10 So I'm going to go through a few other points with you. We talked about some 
11 of these off the record just now, but I want to make sure that we go through these with 
12 you on the record as well, Mr. Wright. 
13 So, first, it's important that you understand that this interview is voluntary. If at 
14 any time you would like to stop speaking with us, that is your choice. 
15 Similarly, if at any point you need to discuss something with your attorney in 
16 private, please let us know, and we'll take a break so you can have that conversation. 
17 We will turn our cameras off, go on mute, you all can talk as long as you need to, and 
18 then we'll come back on afterwards. 
19 Also, this interview is not under oath, but because this is a formal select 
20 committee investigation, you are obligated under Federal law to tell the truth, the same 
21 as if you were speaking with the FBI or DOJ. 
22 It is unlawful to deliberately provide false information to Congress. For this 
23 interview, providing false information could result in criminal penalties for false 
24 statements. Do you understand that? 
25 Mr. Wright. Yes.  5 
1 Third, you're not obligated to keep the fact of this interview and 
2 what we discuss confidential. You are free to tell whomever you wish that you met with 
3 us, including the prosecutor or judge on your case, or you can tell no one at all. That is 
4 your choice. 
5 You understand that, Mr. Wright? 
6 
7 Mr. Wright. Yes. 
So, fourth, the select committee, we're separate and independent 
8 from the Department of Justice. We have no involvement with the prosecutions, and 
9 the DOJ is not a partner with the select committee and our investigation. 
10 The select committee also is not a party to your criminal case and is not agreeing 
11 to submit anything on your behalf to the judge. Does that also make sense? 
12 Mr. Wright. Yes. 
13 So please let us know, as we move forward, if you need any 
14 breaks or would like to discuss anything with your attorney. 
15 There may be several people asking you questions here today. It's a little easier 
16 virtually because you can see the box light up and we know when to stop talking, but if 
17 you don't understand a question, please simply ask one of us to repeat it. 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 Mr. Wright. Okay. 
All right. 
Mr. Munyer. Before we begin -­
Yeah. 
Mr. Munyer. --how's his volume? Because I've got an external mike I can get 
23 and put right in front of him if that'd be easier. 
24 I'm going to defer to the stenographer. 
25 [Reporter responds.]  6 
1 Mr. Munyer. Okay, good. If at any point it becomes an issue, I can take a break 
2 and it'd take me 5 minutes to get that from the other room and set it up. 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 Okay. Thank you, Mr. Munyer. 
Mr. Munyer. Yeah. 
EXAMINATION 
BY 
Q So, Mr. Wright, let's just start with some background. Tell us a little bit 
8 about yourself like where you're from, how long you've lived there, what's your 
9 educational background? 
10 A I'm from Canton, Ohio. Been there my entire life. Twelfth grade 
11 education. And --
12 Q You say you've been in Canton you're entire life? 
13 A Yes. 
14 Q So how many times have you gone to the Hall of Fame? 
15 A None. 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 Q None. I got you. 
So what do you do for a living? 
A 
Q 
A I own a charter bus company. 
Is this D&L Charter? 
It is. 
Q Okay. We'll get into that a little later. 
22 Have you had any other careers, or has it just been in the bussing, trucking 
23 industry? 
24 A I drove a concrete mixer for 10 years, and that's just about it. 
25 That [inaudible].  1 
2 
3 Q Gotcha. So currently you're still doing bussing --
A Yeah. 
Q --type work? Is that --okay. 
4 So I want to take you to, let's say, during President Trump --former President 
5 Trump's Presidency, right, so 2016 to 2020. 
6 
7 A Okay. 
Q How closely did you follow political events throughout former President 
8 Trump's term? 
9 A Well, I tell you, I never voted before the year 2016, but I did vote in 2016. 
10 didn't follow real close, I guess, until the pandemic. Because it's --the company we 7 
11 have, you're extremely busy, 24/7. It's not --you know, it's not a 9-to-5 job, like working 
12 for somebody else. When you got a small business, you're busy all the time. 
13 And then when the pandemic hit, you know, it just kind of just went to zero. So 
14 then I started watching, you know, the internet and the news and --you know, that's 
15 really when I started to learn names, you know, and --and politics and --
16 Q Got it. So it was when the lockdown started that your business took a hit. 
17 ls that fair? 
18 
19 A Yeah. March 12th, 2020. 
Q Okay. I'm sorry to hear that as well about your business during that time, 
20 but it sounds like things have picked back up. Is that fair? 
21 A More than ever. 
22 Q That's good. So let's go then to the COVID lockdown timeframe where 
23 things slowed down for you. You mentioned you started watching the news. Tell us 
24 some of the news sources you were starting to watch at this time. 
25 A Mostly FOX. But I --I --well, I was on social media at the time. So, you  1 know, there was Facebook, and I think that's about it. Because I don't really 
2 have --didn't have any of the other accounts. Just what was on Face book and FOX 
3 News. 
4 And then, of course, I voted for Trump, so we rallied and we did parades and, you 
5 know, things like that for --for the election --
6 
7 
8 Q 
A 
Q Right. 
--during the pandemic. Because I had lots of time. 
I hear you. I guess so that's --I understand you had more time once the 8 
9 pandemic started. What drew you to watching news versus, say, maybe sports or reality 
10 TV or something like that? What was it about the news that made you want to watch 
11 that during the lockdowns? 
12 A I guess --I guess the President kind of told us, you know, his promises in his 
13 first election, and, you know, one of them was to drain the swamp. And you could see 
14 things --you know, I don't know what's true, what's not true, but you could --you 
15 could --it was interesting, you know, to see what was happening in a world that I'd never 
16 been in, you know. It was --it was definitely interesting, you know, to see everybody's 
17 opinions and, you know, the left versus the right. Although I --1 think it's all too large, 
18 but that's just my opinion, you know. 
19 Q Right. I'm going to go through --because I know --so it sounds like FOX 
20 News, that was your primary, I guess --
21 
22 A 
Q Yeah. 
--traditional cable network that you watched. Were there any others that 
23 you watched? 
24 
25 A 
Q Not really, no. 
Okay. And I'm just going through the different news sources. So did you  1 read any print publications, like the local newspaper or New York Times or anything like 
2 that? Did you read anything when you'd get your news? 
3 
4 
5 
6 A 
Q 
A 
Q No. 
Okay. And then it sounds like -­
Unless it was on Facebook, you know. 
Okay. Okay. Perfect. So with Facebook, then, and social media, we 
7 know you used Facebook. I'm going to go through some other social media apps. It 
8 sounds like you didn't use them, but I just want to make sure we're not missing 
9 something. 
10 What about Parler, did you ever use Parler? 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A No. 
Reddit? 
No. 
Telegram? 
I did have a Telegram account, but I --I didn't like it. I just don't think it 
16 works very good, so I really didn't use it. 
17 
18 Q 
A Okay. What, I guess --I guess, what interested you in using Telegram? 
I guess it was an alternative, you know, because they were censoring 
19 Facebook, you know --
20 
21 Q 
A Right. 
--with a lot of the COVID stuff. So, you know, it'd be some other way to 
22 get information. 
23 Q How did you hear of Telegram? Was it through Face book or friends? 
24 guess, how did it even come on your radar? 
25 A You know, I can't remember. It's been over a year ago. 9  1 
2 Q Yep, yep. Just to the best of your recollection, that's all we're asking. 
What about Twitter? It doesn't sound like --from what we talked about before 
3 we went on the record, it doesn't sound like you used Twitter, like, at all? 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 A No. I don't even know how to use Twitter. 
Q Okay. What about GETTR? 
A No. 
Q TheDonald.win? 
A No. I didn't even know that existed. 
Q Let's see --
A Let me write that down --no. 
Q Gab? 
A No. 
Q Okay. And Wimkin, W-i-m-k-i-n? 
A I never heard of it. 
Q Did you watch --and going back to the cable news, did you watch OAN? 
A Occasional, yeah. 
Q Okay. And did you watch Newsmax at all? 
A On occasion. The biggest shows I watched was Tucker and Hannity and 
19 Laura, and there was another. Shannon Bream, I think, was on after that. It was 
20 always at night --
21 
22 Q Yeah. 
A --the nighttime. But, I mean, a lot of times it watched me more than I 
23 watched it. 10 
24 Q And what about on Telegram, were there any specific chats or channels that 
25 you were following on Telegram?  A No. 1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 Q Okay. Did you use Signal at this time as well? 
A What is it? 
Q Signal? 
A I never heard of it. 
Okay. Let's see. 
7 followup on that. You might, you might not. 
BY Not right now. Thanks. 
Okay. No problem. , I know you might have some 
8 
9 
10 
11 Q Did you follow former President Trump on Facebook or any of the social 
12 media that you were on? 
13 A I don't --yeah, I guess he had --not really, I didn't follow him particularly, 
14 like if he had a web page or whatever. 
15 Q Yeah. So you said you voted in 2016, and it sounds like you helped 
16 campaign or do some campaign events leading up to 2020. So I'm assuming you voted 
17 in 2020 as well. 
18 
19 
20 
21 A Yes. 
Q lsthatfair? 
A Yes. 
Q Right after the 2020 election, did you believe that the election had been 
22 stolen from former President Trump? 
23 A My personal belief is I don't think the system works correctly. Whether it 
24 was stolen, I don't know. I don't think it was any different in 2020 than it has been in 
25 many years. 11  12 
1 Q Well, I guess, help us understand what wasn't --what isn't working correctly 
2 about the system. 
3 A Well, it --in 2020, and it's my understanding, you know, just like I said, I 
4 watch the news, that some of the --you know, in some of the States, the laws were 
5 changed and they --the only ones supposed to be able to do that is the legislators, but 
6 other people did. 
7 Now, again, I don't know. I just know what I listen to, you know, but --I don't 
8 know, there's something about --1 just --there's a --there's a lot goes on that just doesn't 
9 seem right with our government, you know. You know, just like January 6th, you know, 
10 there's a lot of people that's been in jail since January 6th, but then there's a lot of people 
11 on the upper hand that will never see a jail cell. 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 Q Yeah. 
Mr. Munyer. I'm sorry to interject. 
You're talking like fundamental fairness. Is that one of your things? 
Mr. Wright. Right, yeah. 
Mr. Munyer. Because you don't have any personal knowledge of the election 
17 being stolen or fraudulent voting or anything like that? 
18 Mr. Wright. No. 
19 
20 
21 Mr. Munyer. It's just stuff you've read? 
Mr. Wright. Right. 
Mr. Munyer. Okay. 
22 And that's --this is --the background of the committee, look, 
23 we're trying to --our goal at the end of this is we're going to make recommendations to 
24 the congressional members about policies and laws and things of that nature. And I 
25 think understanding people's distrust or trust of the system is important for us to collect  13 
1 and understand so that we can make appropriate recommendations for the committee. 
2 So everything that we're asking you about, the election and your feelings about 
3 the election, we understand it's based upon your personal views, whether it be through 
4 reading, on social media, hearing from friends. We're just trying to understand what 
5 those opinions are and what the foundation of those opinions are so that we can make 
6 the appropriate recommendations to our folks here on the committee. Does that make 
7 sense? 
8 
9 Mr. Wright. Yeah. 
Mr. Munyer. Give me just 1 second. I have to take a phone call for 10 seconds. 
10 I'll be right back on. 
11 We'll recess in place, so we'll just recess in place. 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 Mr. Munyer. Perfect. Thank you. 
[Recess.] 
Mr. Munyer. Okay. We're ready. 
Sounds good. 
BY 
Q So, Mr. Wright, did you --I guess on social media, through some of your 
18 other readings, were you reading messages or thoughts from QAnon? 
19 
20 
21 A 
Q 
A No. I do not believe in QAnon. 
Okay. 
You know, I know some people that do, and I try to tell them different, but, 
22 you know, everybody's their own person. 
23 Q I guess, what were you trying to tell them different? I guess, help 
24 us --what were you explaining to them about QAnon? Or what made you 
25 uncomfortable --or you kind of laughed just now --what made you uncomfortable about  14 
1 QAnon? 
2 A Because everything that it says was going to happen never happened. 
3 Nothing that it said was going to happen ever happened. 
4 Mr. Wright, if you don't mind, could we just back up a couple of 
5 questions? Because you were talking about, you know, stuff not working right. And I 
6 was wondering if you could just go into a little bit more detail, like setting the QAnon stuff 
7 aside. Like, what wasn't working right that you saw? 
8 Mr. Wright. Well, I don't believe that --that --this is just a personal belief that I 
9 have. I don't believe that Congress should be in for life. I think they should have term 
10 limits. That's just a belief I have, and it really aggravates me, it bothers me, you know, 
11 that they don't have term limits. That's one thing. 
12 It's not a --a left or right thing with me, okay? I didn't even know what I was 
13 until 2016, and I still may not be a Republican, okay? Because they do a lot of things 
14 that I don't like either. 
15 I just don't see the government working for the people, is what I don't see. And, 
16 you know, December 27th, 2020 --I'm sorry --I think it was 2020. 
17 When did --when did the pandemic start, the beginning of the --
18 Mr. Munyer. They --they locked down the country in March of '20. 
19 Mr. Wright. '20, yeah. So December 27th, Trump signed the --the bill, you 
20 know, for the $1,400. But in that bill was also $10 million that went to Pakistan for 
21 gender studies. Okay. Why he signed it, I --I'm sure that it would --you know, they 
22 would've overrode it anyways. But it's just things like that, I don't see no reason for 
23 that. You know, that's our hard-earned working money. And why would it be in there 
24 with corona money? It just doesn't make sense. 
25 You know, most of the things they do don't make sense to me. You see good  15 
1 things in these bills that go through, and then you see the garbage that goes with it that 
2 has nothing to even do with the people of the United States. 
3 You know, they send humanitarian aid to all these countries, and right here, we 
4 got homeless --I mean, I don't know if you ever seen videos of New York City and in 
5 California, it's terrible. It's just terrible what we got going, and we do nothing about it. 
6 I don't know if that helps with why I don't trust our government, but 
7 it's just --that's some of the reasons. You know, it just --it's awful to see what goes on 
8 here, you know, and we're sending --what are we --$31 trillion in debt now, and we're 
9 sending money to, you know, gender studies in Pakistan. It doesn't make sense. 
10 
11 Q BY 
Yeah. No, I completely understand where you're coming from. 
12 Who do you think is responsible for, you know, the misguided priorities in 
13 Washington? 
14 
15 A 
Q You mean as far as what department or, you know --
Well, let me ask, why do you think --you know, you've outlined some 
16 concerns that you have with the way that D.C. works, and I understand what you were 
17 saying. I'm just curious, you know, where you think that's coming from or why you think 
18 it's happening. 
19 A Well, I think it's a voting thing, and, you know, in order to get enough votes 
20 for something that I feel is good, they have to put something in that really doesn't make 
21 sense to me, to get that to go through. 
22 In other words --we'll just go with that one I was talking about. For the $1,400 
23 to go out to Americans, okay, that 10 million had to be in there or they wouldn't have 
24 passed it. You know, there wouldn't have been enough votes to --because this person 
25 didn't get what they wanted or that person didn't get what they wanted. And it  16 
1 shouldn't be. 
2 I don't agree with the way they mix all the bills together. I personally think they 
3 have enough time that they could individualize things in --just in groups, okay? You see 
4 what I mean? So if it's corona, then it should only be corona. It shouldn't be anything 
5 else. There should be nothing else in that bill that doesn't have anything to do with 
6 coronavirus. 
7 And it just --but they throw it --and we see this money going out, and, you know, 
8 we're --you guys are, we're paying for this. You know, this is our money, and it's not 
9 benefiting us at all. And we're already in debt, you know. My grandkids are going to 
10 be paying for the $1,400 check I got 2 years ago. It's just aggravating, you know. 
11 Q So when you say they, who is they? I guess that's where I'm coming from, 
12 because you said "they" a bunch of times, and I'm trying to understand who is they. 
13 A The government, period. And, you know, Congress and, obviously, the 
14 President what --has to sign the bill. So anybody involved in these makings. And, 
15 again, I haven't really studied politics. I don't know everything about it. But, you 
16 know, we, the people hear that, well, you know, this got in this bill because this lobbyist, 
17 you know, donated X amount of dollars to this person's campaign fund. You know, so 
18 they put --to me, that's --that's crooked. 
19 Q Would it surprise you to know that Republicans supported that provision in 
20 the COVID bill that you're talking about? 
21 A It wouldn't surprise me at all. It wouldn't. If it benefited that person, it 
22 wouldn't surprise me at all. 
23 Got it. Okay. Well, that was really helpful, so I'll turn it back to 
24 -· 
25 Thank you.  1 
2 BY 
Q So after the election --I know you said that you didn't believe that the 17 
3 election had been stolen from former President Trump, but you did have some concerns. 
4 Did you participate in any activities or rallies or anything after the election? And this is 
5 pre-Jan 6. Did you participate in any rallies or anything? 
6 A Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I was there November 14th, I 
7 think, I was in D.C. 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 Q Okay. 
A And then December 12th. 
Q Okay. So you came to both rallies in D.C.? 
A Yeah. And then January 6th, yes. 
Q Did you --and we'll touch on that in a second. Did you go to any other 
13 rallies, say, in Ohio or Michigan or anywhere else? 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 Mr. Munyer. Are you talking about in that window or at all? 
BY 
Q In that window, yeah, in that --the window is going to be --
A I don't --
Q --post-election day, pre-Jan 6. 
A I don't believe so. I mean --
Q Okay. 
A --I don't have a good memory, and if it's not --
Q No problem. 
A 
Q --important to me, I don't really remember it. But I don't believe I did, no. 
I guess, help me understand your mind state then during this window. 
25 know we're still in COVID lockdowns at this time. It sounds like you're reading the news,  1 following Facebook, following FOX. What were you thinking in this window? 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 A From the day of the election? 
Q Yes. 
A Obviously, Trump was still putting the words out. 
Q Yeah. 
A And, you know, he told us, well, this is what's going to happen, you know, 
7 we're going to have inflation, we'll probably go to war. You know, just things weren't 18 
8 going to be good, you know. And it kind of aggravated me, you know. And then --and 
9 I'm not sure when it was --it would've been after December the 12th but before 
10 January 6th, he put a message out. I don't know if it was on Facebook or if it got to 
11 Facebook, but he called the American people to D.C. 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 Q That's perfect. That's perfect. 
A He called us over there. 
Q Can we put up exhibit 3? 
Mr. Wright. Is he talking to you? 
Mr. Munyer. He's going to put it up here. 
No, no, no, no. 
Q So this is a tweet from former President Trump on December 19th. At the 
20 end of it, he says: Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild. 
21 
22 
23 Is this the message that you recall vaguely? 
A I did --I did see that, but I seen it on Facebook. 
Q Okay. No, that makes sense. That's perfect. So we pulled the Twitter 
24 version, but we understand that this message got to almost every social media site there 
25 is.  1 
2 
3 So this had an influence on you wanting to come back to D.C. on January 6th? 
A Yes. 
Q Okay. We can take that down. Thank you. 
4 Going back to November 14th and December 12th, let's start with the 14th. 
5 What made you want to come to D.C. on November 14th? 
6 A You know, I'm going to have to be honest. I can't remember. I mean, 
7 that's --
8 Q No, it's a long time ago. 
9 Were you following --were you following the "stop the steal" movement at this 
10 time? 
11 A I never really followed that movement. I've never really followed any of 19 
12 the movements. You know, I know there were like a dozen different categories or, you 
13 know, groups or --
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 Mr. Munyer. Did you bring a bus full of people on those other trips? 
Mr. Wright. Yes. All three times. 
Mr. Munyer. Okay. So that's --
Perfect. 
Mr. Wright. Yeah. I was --you know, we were out of work, and I was 
19 generating revenue, so --

22 
23 
24 
25 Q Okay. So do you recall an individual named Ali Alexander? 
A I think I do. 
Q Okay. What do you recall about him?

He's American.  1

15 A Well, yeah, I know, but I mean, he's --
Q Yeah, yeah. 
A --he's --I think he --
Q Yes. 
A --has an accent. 
Q Yeah. I don't have a picture of him, but yes. 
A 
Q 
A Is he from California? 
He is not from California. 
I know who you're talking about, yeah. 
Q Okay. You know who I'm talking about? Perfect. Great. 
A Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Q Do you follow him? 
A I know who he is. 
Q Do you follow --are you following him? 
A But I've seen --you know, I've seen him talk, but I didn't follow really 
16 anybody. 
17 
18 Q Got it. 
A I just --I tell you what I did, is --is the --I don't even know what you call it. 
19 You know when you open your Facebook and that first page, and it's --
20 
21 Mr. Munyer. News Feed. 
Mr. Wright. Is that what --News Feed, okay. That's the only thing I've ever, 
22 you know --and everything popped up on your News Feed because they know what 
23 you're --you know, they know what you're interested in. 
24 
25 Q Right, right. So then help --walk us through, then, how you got involved 20  21 
1 with arranging a bus of folks to come from Ohio to D.C. for both rallies. How did that 
2 come about? 
3 A Like I say, I own a charter business, and we did a lot of parades and --and I 
4 had a lot of contacts on Face book, like a lot of --I don't know if you call them followers --
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 Q Yeah. 
A --I guess. 
Q Face book friends. 
A But, you know, and I put the event up, and they --
Mr. Munyer. And to give a full explanation, talk about --because during the BLM 
10 riots and stuff, you were organizing pro-police stuff, and this is all the same group of 
11 people. 
12 Mr. Wright. Right. 
13 Mr. Munyer. Right. 
14 Mr. Wright. Yeah. 
15 Mr. Munyer. Explain that. 
16 Mr. Wright. Yeah, we did --you know, we did a lot of Back the Blue rallies and 
17 stuff Ii ke that. 
18 And I guess we'll go right back to the beginning when you asked me a little bit 
19 about who I am. I'm a very local person. I do believe in my community, and I do a lot 
20 for my community. You know, that's --it's just --I hate to see anybody suffer, you know, 
21 whether --if you try, I'm with you. You know, I don't care if you're Democrat, 
22 Republican, Independent, male, female, gay, straight, Black, none of that matters to me. 
23 Okay? What matters to me is that you're a productive person if you can be. 
24 And, I mean, this goes all the way down in my blood line. I have blood that I 
25 don't speak to, because they don't live life like I think they should. I think you should be  22 
1 a productive person and do the right thing all the time. And if you see somebody in 
2 need, you should help that person in need. Okay? 
3 And --and I have been taken advantage of many a times. I'm talking about 
4 thousands of dollars, but it doesn't even bother me, because I know I still did the right 
5 thing, you know. So --and I know I'm bouncing all over the place, but I just give 
6 thoughts as they come to my head. 
7 But I --I help everybody. I mean, you know, it's --they want to divide. You 
8 know, that's another thing about the government when you say my mistrust is --they 
9 want to divide everything. You know, everything's divisive in the government. And it's 
10 not that way, you know. And I know just by everyday American talk that a lot of people 
11 say, well, you know, if this guy says he's got a lot of Black friends, he's a racist. Well, 
12 that's bullshit. That's not true. That's not true. 
13 I have --I got guys --a guy --he's actually almost 80 years old. We've been 
14 friends for 30 years. He owns a bus company, and we're thick as thieves. I don't know 
15 if that's the way I should put it or not, but I mean, we're like father, son. You know, we 
16 actually tease, you know, he's my Black daddy, I'm his White son. Because we can 
17 intermingle our races and tease about it. 
18 And I got friends that are, you know, gay as a $3 bill. But it doesn't matter to me; 
19 they're good people, you know. I mean, I'm just a very open-ended person, I guess I 
20 should say. But I think you got a dumb idea, I'm going to let you know you got a dumb 
21 idea. 
22 But --but --so to the buses you asked about, yeah, I took buses on all three dates. 
23 I don't know if it was, you know, one, two, three. I can't remember which days had 
24 what, but I sold seats, and it generated revenue. And believe you me, there were 
25 people that didn't have money, but they rode the bus anyways. You know -- 1 
2 Got it. 
Mr. Wright. --that's just --that's just the kind of person I am. 23 
3 BY 
4 Q Do you --I guess you said you put something up on Facebook for this rally. 
5 What did you put up on Facebook? 
6 
7 
8 A 
Q 
A It was an event. You can --
What --
--create an event, and it was --it was --you know, it was just transportation, 
9 you know, to the rally. That's about all it was. I mean, there was no --no statements 
10 or --it was just a --just an event. You know, if you want to go, this is where we're 
11 picking up, this is where we're --what time we're leaving, and this is what it costs. 
12 Q So President Trump --former President Trump didn't tweet about this event. 
13 So where are you getting the information to make an event with for this?

Oh, yeah. Everything I became aware of, it was always on Facebook. 
Got it. Okay. And approximately how many people did you bring down? 
21 How many buses, how many people did you bring down to Washington, D.C.?

Okay. Where did you bring them from? Canton, Ohio? 
Canton, Akron, Cleveland. They're all within a [inaudible] of each other. 
And how long would you stay in D.C. for these trips? 
I'd say we probably get there probably around 11 a.m. and out by 3 or 4 
Rough guesses on all of them, about the same times. 
Oh, so a day trip, come down in the morning, leave in the evening? 
Yeah. You leave at, you know, 5 o'clock in the morning and get there at 
10 around 11 or --and then, you know, just stay, 3 or 4 or 5 hours, and then you go back 
11 home. You just go for the rally and then leave. 
12 Q Okay. And how much were you charging --I know you said some people 
13 couldn't pay, but how much were you charging for the buses? 
14 
15 A 
Q Just 50 bucks a seat. 
Fifty bucks. Got it. 
16 I know,_, you might have some followup for that. 
17 And if not, just let me know. 
All right. Looks like - actually might be frozen. 
Mr. Munyer. One second. He's got a question for me. I'm going to mute. 
Okay. We'll recess in place and --

10 Oh, sorry. I thought you could hear. 
11 -· --I'm just going to kind of pick up and we'll walk through the --
12 So, , the reason why I turned it over to 
13 you is that we just found out that Mr. Wright organized buses from Ohio to D.C. for 
14 November 14th and December 12th. 
15 Okay. All right. 
16 [Audio malfunction.] 
17 So,_, can you call in and we'll get to the buses later.

2 anything.

6 
7 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q No. I've never donated to anything, whether it's a campaign fund or 
And did you have anything to do with organizing it? 
No. 
Okay. So --
Other than the buses. 
Let's move on then to the January 6th rallies, okay? Or actually, I want to 
8 go back to the November/December rallies. Were you interested in going to those 
9 rallies yourself? 
10 
11 
12 A 
Q 
A Yes. 
What about those rallies made you want to come to D.C. to attend? 
I like listening to President Trump's speeches. I actually attended, you 
13 know, a couple of his rallies prior to the --

A 
Q 
A I just muted-. No worries. Sorry about that. 
BY 
Sorry. Can you continue, Mr. Wright? 
Yeah. Can you repeat the question because I forgot -­
Yeah. What made you want to come to D.C. --
Oh --
--for those rallies? 
--just --you know, now that you say that, I'm not sure if Trump spoke at 
23 November or December, either one. 
24 Q He did not speak at them. So I guess that's what we're trying to 
25 understand, is what made you want to come. 26  27 
1 A I guess just to be with the people. I --I don't know. You know, it was just 
2 interesting. 
3 Q What was it were you trying to --I guess, were you trying to accomplish 
4 anything? And not you specifically, but as a group. What was your understanding of 
5 what you were trying to accomplish by coming to these rallies? 
6 
7 
8 A 
Q Yeah, I don't even know, to tell you the truth. 
Okay. 
Okay. _, did you have a followup? Sound like you 
9 might've come off mute. 
10 -· Yeah. I'm just a little curious about, do you know who was on your 
11 buses, like for the November rally and the December rally? 
12 Mr. Wright. Just Facebook friends. I really don't --I don't have any access. 
13 mean, I could tell you if I had access to the event, you know, and it gave me a list, but --
14 Mr. Munyer. So by way of example, all of that stuff was seized by the 
15 government when they searched his house, and it's now still in possession of the FBI. 
16 We don't have the --he has like handwritten ledgers of who he collected money from just 
17 for tax purposes, but it's not any organization or anything. It's just people that showed 
18 up and he took $50 and wrote their name down. And to my knowledge, only one other 
19 person on any of the buses was ever charged in the January 6th. 
20 
21 
22 -· Understood. 
BY-: 
Q So just as a followup then, did you advertise the bus to any groups of 
23 people? 
24 A No. I just put the event on Facebook, and it was --it was all individuals, you 
25 know, that -- 1 
2 Q 
A Okay. Thank you. 
I mean, it could've been groups, you know, like, say, a couple and another 
3 couple. But no major --not one group per bus. You know, I sold the individual seats. 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 Q 
A Right. So you weren't aware of any militia group on your bus? 
No. 
-· Okay. Thank you. 
BY 
Q So we showed the tweet earlier from President Trump on December 19th. 28 
9 It appears you saw his tweet telling everyone to come to D.C. for January 6th, will be wild. 
10 You might've seen that on Facebook or another social media app. Is that correct? 
11 
12 A 
Q Right. Facebook. 
Facebook. And you talked about how you came to the first two rallies in 
13 D.C. in November and December. But what factors specifically influenced your decision 
14 to come to D.C. on January 6th? 
15 A Well, one thing was money. And the next thing was, you know, he told us 
16 to come. I mean, you know, he asked us to be there. 
17 Q And by he, you mean former President Trump? 
18 A Yes. 
19 Q Okay. And with the money, when you said money, it was --you were 
20 transporting, I'm assuming, more people to the rally so you had a chance to make some 
21 money with your business? 
22 A Yeah. It was $5,000 for our business, you know, and at that time, you 
23 know, there was nothing. 
24 Q When did you first, I guess --so he tweeted on December 19th. Was it 
25 almost immediately, like, okay, we're going on January 6th?  1 A I would say yeah. Again, I don't have access to the information. I could 
2 tell you exactly what date I created the event, but I don't know. 
Q 
A 
Q 
A But it was fairly immediate? I mean, that's -­
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. 
--really all we're looking for. 
Yeah. 29

BY 
Q Were you a member of the "stop the steal" group chat or group on Face book 
10 at all, leading into January 6th? 
11 
12 A 
Q No. I was not a member of any groups, I don't --I don't think. 
Okay. And you were not members of Women for America First group on 
13 Facebook either? 
14 A No. I've seen --I've seen some of their stuff, but I was --I don't believe I 
15 was a member. I mean, I don't know how you become a member, but --I'm going to say 
16 no. But, basically, what I did was, you know, I viewed everything on --what'd you call it, 
17 the --
18 
19 Mr. Munyer. The News Feed. 
Mr. Wright. --News Feed. And, you know, I --I pulled things off there, I read 
20 them and --but I was never into any --any --I was never active in any of the groups or 
21 whatever you're talking about on Facebook. 
22 BY 
23 
24 Q 
A Did you help promote the January 6th rallies on social media websites? 
I probably shared it, I would imagine. I mean, obviously I sold seats on 
25 buses, so I guess the question (sic) for that would be yes.  30 
1 Q And if you --let's see. I guess that's all. You just --so sharing was your 
2 primary promotion of the events. You weren't --like, you created your own bus event, 
3 and you might've shared the official events. Is that fair? 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Yeah. 
Okay. 
I don't know if I did, but I might have. 
And this was all on Facebook? 
Yes. 
Other than former President Trump, what impact, if any, did elected officials 
10 have on your wishes or decision to come to D.C. on January 6th? Were there any other 
11 politicians that influenced you? 
12 
13 
14 
15 A 
Q 
A 
Q Give me a minute to think. 
Please, take your time. 
Not really. I don't think so. Can't think of any right offhand. 
Were there any television personalities or social media personalities that 
16 made you want to travel to D.C. on January 6th? 
17 A Not that I'm aware. I mean, you know, I may have seen it on a --a 
18 newscast or --or, you know, I may have seen somebody speak of it, but not --not really, I 
19 guess. I really don't --I can't say yes or no, because, you know, I just don't remember. 
20 My memory is not very collective on things that doesn't really matter to me. 
21 Got it. So I know earlier we were talking about the buses in 
22 regard to the November and the December rallies. 
23 We want to focus now on the bus situation for the January 6th rally, and I'm going 
24 to turn it over to my colleague,_, who, I believe, is dialed in. So I'll turn it over 
25 to him now.  1

Q BY 
Hi, Mr. Wright. Can you hear me? 
Yes. 
I apologize, my power's out in my house, so I don't have internet, so I'm 
5 trying to use the cell phone, and it's coming --and it's really coming in and out, so I 
6 apologize for that. 
7 And I believe I heard you said you had chartered two buses. Is that just for 
8 January 6th, or was that for another event? 
9 A That was for January 6th. 31 
10 Q Okay. And I may be covering some stuff that you've already talked about, 
11 and I apologize because I think I probably did miss it. But were you chartering those 
12 buses for yourself or did somebody come to you to charter? 
13 
14 
15 
16 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
17 media or --
18 
19 A 
Q No, it was for myself. 
And so you were essentially the organizer for the two buses? 
For the two buses, correct. 
And you did that --I think I heard you say you had a --maybe through social 
Yeah. I created an event on Facebook. 
Okay. And how would the people who --would they respond to you via 
20 message through Facebook or would they contact you by phone, email? 
21 A It was --it was --it was --when you do an event on Facebook, you can check, 
22 like, going, so then it would tell me that --
23 
24 Q 
A Okay. 
--you know, who was going. And then I believe I had instructions 
25 somewhere in there in text of how to pay for their seat.  1

3 
4 
5 
6 
7 Q Okay. Now, was that linked to like a PayPal account or --
A Yeah, it was a PayPal. Yeah. 
Q Okay. And how much were you charging? 
A Fifty dollars. Fifty dollars per person. 
Q So that's --and was it roughly 50 people on a bus? 
A Yes. 
Q At $50 a --so were you planning to make money off this or is it kind of a 
8 break even? 
A No. We made money. We own the buses, so we made money. 32 
9 
10 Q Yeah. Okay. Was there any other groups that you were involved in with 
11 planning bus trips? 
12 
13 
14 A No. 
Q Are you aware of any other groups that were coming from your area? 
A There was --I think it was January 6th. I think there was seven buses came 
15 out of Cleveland. 
16 Q And do you know who --I'm sorry. Do you know who organized those 
17 buses? 
18 A I do not know who organized them, no, but --because I picked up at the 
19 same place that they did. And I think it was January 6th. I'm sure it was that event 
20 that --that I picked up at the same pickup location as those buses did. So that's how I 
21 knew they were going. 
22 
23 Q Okay. And which location was that, was the pickup? 
A It was an old Kmart on Rockside Road, and I think it might be considered 
24 Cleveland. 
25 Mr. Munyer. That's in --on the border of Cleveland and Independence, Ohio, on  33 
1 77 North, just south of Cleveland maybe 30 minutes. 
2 BY 
Q Okay. So the morning, I guess you had to leave pretty early -- 3 
4 A Yeah. We left --we left --that particular bus left Canton at 2:30, and it left 
5 Cleveland at 4 a.m. 
6 
7 Q Okay. Now, did you caravan with the other buses? 
A No. I mean, granted, on the way, we seen many buses on the highway, you 
8 know, but we didn't caravan with anybody; just ourselves. 
9 
10 Q Okay. So just your two buses left together? 
A Well, the second bus left Canton --I don't even know what time --I think 4 
11 o'clock, and then it picked up in Akron. And then we met up on Interstate 70 on the way 
12 to D.C. at a service plaza and traveled in together. 
13 Q Okay. Did you have any contact with any politicians, being --whether local, 
14 State, or Federal? 
15 
16 A No. 
Q And I think-was asking you about the rally organizers, Women for 
17 America First. Any contact with any of those? 
18 
19 A No. I've never had any contact with anybody. 
Q Okay. So once your buses left your area, where were you planning to drop 
20 offatinD.C.? 
21 A We went to Union Station. That's where we parked at, and that's where 
22 we unloaded. 
23 
24 
25 Q All right. So both buses parked at Union --
A Union Station. 
Q --Station parking garage?  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 A Yes. 
Q And I assume there's a fee for that? 
A There is. 
Q Okay. And that was all part of the cost of the bus trip, was figured in? 
A Yeah. Yeah, we prepaid all that. 
Q Okay. Do you by chance --did you drive one of the buses? 
A I did. 
Q Okay. And who drove the other bus? 
A Well, it was a driver, but I can't remember which one. I --I can't 
10 remember. 
11 
12 Q Okay. 
A Because we do multibus trips all the time and I just --they all run together. 
13 I really don't know, to be honest. 34 
14 Q And I think you may have already been asked this, but any of the passengers 
15 on your buses, you know, that you'd consider wearing like tactical or riot-type clothing? 
16 
17 
18 
19 A 
Q 
A No. 
Like helmets, ballistic vests, that kind of -­
No. 
Q Okay. Any discussions amongst the passengers about wanting to be 
20 involved in violence? 
21 
22 A No. 
Q Are you aware of anybody who was on your buses that was involved in the 
23 violence or was arrested? 
24 A There was a lady on my bus, she was, I believe, a schoolteacher from 
25 Cleveland, that was arrested. But I don't think it was for violence. I think she's the  35 
1 one --and I can't --I'm trying to think of her name. Christine or Christina, and I don't 
2 know her last name. She's the one that they had in somebody's office sitting next to 
3 somebody. I can't remember. But she was on national TV before we even left D.C., 
4 so --so she knew, you know, that she was in trouble and --we were on the East Side, so 
5 we parked at --when I say we, I'm talking about myself and some friends. I don't know 
6 what the whole hundred people did. But there was probably, I don't know, maybe a 
7 dozen of us that were together pretty much most of the time. 
8 And we left Union Station, and like right across from Union Station is the street 
9 that you go --you just walk straight across, and it goes right to the East Side of the 
10 Capitol, I believe. But anyway, so we walked straight across that street, and we went 
11 back to the East Side of the Capitol, I'm going to say, right in the middle, I guess. And I 
12 don't know if you're familiar with the area, but there was --go ahead. 
13 
14 Q 
A I was going to say relatively familiar. 
Okay. So on the east side where we were, obviously you got the Capitol, 
15 and then behind you, you have the Supreme Court. But like right where we stayed the 
16 whole time we were there, there was a set of stairs that went down to an elevator. And 
17 then just to the south side of that was a --something that, I don't know, it stuck up from 
18 the ground a couple feet. It was probably, rough guessing, 40 feet long and maybe 15 or 
19 20 feet deep. And I'm not sure, you know, if it was a planter or what it was, because it 
20 was covered with people. But that's the area that we were in the whole time we were 
21 there. 
22 I was on the frontline, on the barricades, and there was --I mean, there was tens 
23 of thousands of people there, okay, on the --on the east side. And I was talking to some 
24 of them. There was --I'm going to say there was probably --from visual where I was, I 
25 probably didn't see more than 30 police along that fence. But, again -- 36 
1 ____ We'll get into some of this day of, what you noticed a little later, 
2 so --we'll get into that a little later. 
-· Yep. 
BY 3 
4 
5 Q Just a few more questions. Did you receive any donations from anyone to 
6 assist with the cost of the bus? 
7 
8 A 
Q No. 
Okay. And how about any association with --anybody on your bus 
9 associated with extremist groups? You know, say, Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, some of 
10 the more common ones, but any group? 
11 
12 
13 A 
Q 
A Not that I'm aware of. 
Okay. And about what time did your buses depart D.C.? 
I'm going to say it was between 3:30 and 4 o'clock, rough guess. It might 
14 even been before that, but I --I know --because I went into the rotunda, I'm sure you 
15 guys are aware of that. But as soon as I came out, my group, like I say, our 12, went 
16 to --back to the bus. Now, I don't know what --they got it time stamped, I'm sure they 
17 know what time it was. But I think we pulled out at 4 o'clock from Union Station.  37 
1 
2 [3:05 p.m.] 
3 BY 
Q Okay. And you said --
A Again --
Q Oh, go ahead. I'm sorry. 4 
5 
6 
7 A Again, if I could get to the information, I could tell you, because it was in the 
8 event what time we would get there and what time we were leaving. But, you know, I 
9 don't know if it was 3 o'clock, 4 o'clock, 5 o'clock. I --I don't remember. 
10 Q Okay. No, but --so with all that going on and the chaos and everything, 
11 how did everybody know to get back to the bus to leave? 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 A We left at our scheduled time, whatever it was. 
Q Okay. 
A I think it was around 4 o'clock, but I don't know. 
Q All right. And --
A I have to get back early, because I've got to unlock the bus, I've got to air the 
17 bus up. You know, I had to be there early to prepare. And so, you know, they just kind 
18 of mingled in up until 4 o'clock. Say --say I got there --I don't know --let's just say I got 
19 there at 3:00. I don't really know. And then, you know, everybody knew what time 
20 the buses was leaving. And, believe you me, I don't wait. So if it said 4 o'clock, I left at 
21 4 o'clock. I didn't care who --I don't count people. You know, I --
22 Q Okay. 
23 A If I tell you --just like, you know, American Airlines, if they tell you they're 
24 departing at 4:00, they depart at 4:00. 
25 Q All right. Well, I guess that was my next question. Was everybody who  38 
1 arrived on the bus on the bus when you left? 
2 A I --that --now, that, I can't answer. I --I assume so, but there could have 
3 been one not there, but I wouldn't know it. I didn't --you know, I didn't take head count 
4 or nothing, because that's not how I operate. 
5 Q Okay. And just generally --I don't know if you --I think you said you don't 
6 have access to your records now, so I don't know --
7 
8 
9 you? 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 A I don't. 
Q --if you have access to payment records or bank records related to who paid 
A The FBI took everything. 
Q Okay. All right. 
-· Well, that's all I had,-. Thank you. 
Thank you,-· 
BY 
Q So let's now turn to when you actually got to D.C., and you discussed a lot of 
16 that with Mr. - So it sounds like it was a day trip. 
17 So you arrived --around what time did you arrive in D.C. again? 
18 
19 
20 A I think it was around 11 o'clock. 
Q Okay. Did you attend the rally at the Ellipse when you arrived? 
A No. I went straight from Union Station to the East Side of the Capitol in the 
21 specific area I discussed. 
22 Q Got it. Can we pull up, then --I want to go through some of the messages, 
23 it seems like from the night before, that you sent out on Facebook, and it was in your 
24 sealed complaint, the statement of facts. So can we pull up exhibit 1, please? And 
25 when we pull exhibit 1, let's go to page 8.  39 
1 All right. So at the top of page 8, it looks like on January --this says sent on 
2 January 6th at 3:57 UTC, so that's about 10 p.m. Eastern Time on January 5th. And you 
3 said: We're going to have to fight the blue tomorrow. 
4 Help us understand. Why did you think you were going to have to fight the blue 
5 on January 6th? 
6 A I --I --1 --I don't know. I just thought it was going to be a hectic day. I --I 
7 wasn't sure what was going to become of that day. 
8 Q Yeah. So help --well, what was going to be hectic about that day, then? 
9 What were you --and, look, I get it. This is going back in time, but help us understand 
10 what your mind set was going into January 6th on why it was going to be a hectic day. 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A I got to figure out how to put my thoughts in words, so -­
That's all right. 
I'm not stalling you. I'm just thinking. 
Hey, silence doesn't bother me. Take your time. 
I guess I just felt we were going to get resistance. Actually, I thought there 
16 would be a hundred times more resistance than what we had. But I wasn't sure what 
17 the day was going to bring, I guess is about the only answer I got. 
18 
19 Q 
A When you say resistance, you mean law enforcement resistance? 
Not really. I don't know. I mean, I really don't. We --we've always 
20 encountered, you know, the --I don't know what you call --BLM, antifa folks, but I 
21 never --
22 Q Yeah, yeah. I'm going to stop you there, though, because, like, none of 
23 these messages mention BLM or antifa. They only mention the blue tomorrow. So 
24 that's why, I guess, we're trying to understand why are you talking about the blue on 
25 January 5th and not BLM and antifa?  40 
1 A I guess maybe just a lot of stuff that I had read, you know, that --I did read 
2 things where people said --and I --I don't know who it was or --it wasn't a private 
3 individual. You know, I seen things where they said, oh, well, such-and-such group has 
4 got the tunnels covered. What group, I don't know, but --but I did read things like that. 
5 
6 
7 
8 Q 
A 
Q 
A Do you remember where you were reading these? On Face book? 
On Facebook, yeah. And --
And --
1 don't know how much access they gave you to --to these Facebook 
9 records, or maybe it was only what they had in the indictment, but I --some reason, I 
10 remember somebody asking a question about the tunnels, and I had read something 
11 somewhere, and I said, Well, they have it covered, whoever that is, whoever it was, you 
12 know, or whatever. 
13 There was so much going on and so much reading, I really don't know any details. 
14 I don't think I can help you with any specific names or details or groups because I didn't 
15 pay much attention to it. 
16 Q So what was going to be --I guess, what were you thinking was going to 
17 happen that would have caused resistance from the police? 
18 A I don't know. I just felt it, I guess. I mean, I --again, I couldn't tell you 
19 what I was thinking at that period because I don't remember. 
20 Q So also the night before, you say to this guy on Face book, We have enough 
21 to push through. 
22 Again, I'm just --I'm just --I'm just using common sense here. Push through the 
23 police line? 
24 
25 A 
Q I would assume that's what it means. 
And push through the police line to get into the Capitol?  1 
2 A 
Q Tonight the tempers --what's that? 
Was it pushing through the police line to get to the Capitol? Is that what 
3 you're talking about here? 41 
4 A I was going to say --because I'm reading here on one of these that you have 
5 up here. I guess it might be --its under A, conversation between Wright and individual 
6 1. It's actually on the screen right now. 
7 
8 
9 
10 Mr. Munyer. Yeah, he shared that. 
Q 
A BY 
Correct. 
Yeah. And the second one down says: From what I seen tonight, the 
11 tempers will be up tomorrow. Police lines will be breached. 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 So I don't know. I obviously --
Q 
A 
Q 
A Is that a couple --
--seen --
Sorry. 
I obviously seen something that, you know, people were planning on doing 
17 more than just protesting, I guess. 
18 
19 
20 
21 Q 
A 
Q 
A And you don't remember where you were --where you were seeing -­
No. I seen it --
--what you were talking about --
--somewhere on Facebook. I don't know where. You know, in a News 
22 Feed, or something popped up. 
23 
24 Q Can we scroll down a little more, please? 
There is another message where you say: The first mistake they make in 
25 Chambers, we're going in and drag them out.  1 Is this --so, again, I'm just using common sense. "First mistake they make," is 
2 this in reference to the Congressmen, the legislators? 
3 
4 A 
Q Well, I tell you --no, I think it was Pence. 
Pence. Okay. So Vice President Pence? 
5 A Yeah. I think it was --I think the challenge was for him to challenge the 
6 electors. And if he didn't --
7 Q And --
8 A I tell you, like I say, where I was standing --and I was telling you about the 
9 flowerpot or whatever was behind me --this was the only guy that I know, and I don't 
10 even know him, that really I heard personally talking about breaching the building. 42 
11 And they were --they were --the people in the crowd were listening to what was 
12 going on in the building. The --in the Chambers, you know, the --whatever you call it, 
13 reading of the votes or --
14 
15 Q 
A The congressional session. Correct. 
Yeah. And this guy's --this guy was kind of the one calling the shots of 
16 what everybody was doing. And, you know, he said, When I say, then --you know, to 
17 breach the --breach the fence line. But at that point, when he did say it, I was sitting in 
18 the chair in front of him. So, you know, I don't know --obviously the fence came down, 
19 but I don't think there was resistance. 
20 Q Now, you're not speaking from what you saw. You're just speaking 
21 from --what are you speaking from when you said there was no resistance? 
22 A I --I don't think there was any resistance when the fence went down. 
23 There was really nobody there on the line. Like, I think they just started taking it apart 
24 and walking in. Not in the building, but into the --this closed area or --
25 Q Yeah. So --look, I don't have the video ready for this. I didn't think we  43 
1 were going to get into this, but, I mean, it's undisputed that people pushed 
2 through --violently pushed through the fences to get to the initial fence to get to the 
3 Capitol Grounds. But that --I know you didn't witness that, so it's not important for us 
4 to get into that right now. 
5 How did you get into the Capitol? 
6 A Well, like I say, I wasn't there --I mean, I was there, but I was in the back 
7 when the --when the people first started going towards the building. And --and the 
8 steps were full, so I walked up the steps. And when I got there, the door was open. 
9 mean --
10 Q Which side did you walk up the steps? Did you walk up the steps where 
11 the --
12 
13 
14 A 
Q 
A Oh, the --
--observation stage was or the other side? 
Oh, I was on the east side. I was never on the west side. 
15 Q And how long were you in the --in the Capitol, approximately? 
16 A You know, I'm --and it could have been 2 minutes, it could have been 
17 9 minutes. I'm going to say approximately 5 to 7 minutes, because by the time I got to 
18 the top of the steps, I was wore out. 
19 
20 Mr. Munyer. Explain why. 
Mr. Wright. Yeah. And I 
21 had never been in the Capitol, so I --I walked in and I sat down on one of the benches and 
22 had a cigarette, and I made a video, and I left. 
23 And so however long --you know, I'm going to say somewhere between, you 
24 know, 5 and 7 minutes, but it could have been 9 minutes. I don't know. They have it 
25 when I went in and went out. I just don't know what it is. But I was on the -- 1 
2 Q 44 
BY 
Help me under---help me understand this, Mr. Wright, because the way it 
3 sounds with you, it sounds like you just walked up the steps and walked in the Capitol, all 
4 right? But from my understanding --and we'll show you this video a little later --I have 
5 you walking out of the Capitol at 2:50, and the doors you went through weren't even 
6 breached until 2:38. 
7 So before 2:38, there were people, like, on the east side packed on those steps 
8 trying to push into the door. So were you standing there as part of that pack on the east 
9 side steps? 
10 
11 
12 
13 A No. No. I --I --I probably wasn't --
Q You just walked up the steps? You just walked up the steps? 
A I walked up the left side of the steps. 
Q You didn't see any --the Oath Keepers stack or anything like that going to 
14 the same door that you went through? 
15 
16 A What are they? 
Q You didn't see like the Oath Keepers in a stack formation go through that 
17 door, the same door you went through? 
18 
19 
20 A 
Q 
A No. I tell you what I did see --
Did you see Alex Jones on your side of the steps? 
If he was there, I didn't see him, no. But what I did see is on the --let's see. 
21 That's west, so it would be on the south side of that porch, there were like --I'm going to 
22 rough guess --a dozen police officers in that corner of the porch. And I don't know if --
23 Q I guess --I've heard you mention the police officers a few times now. 
24 guess I'm just curious. Are you saying the police should have known that you all wanted 
25 to go in the Capitol?  45 
1 A I think they did know that that was what was going to happen. I know we 
2 all knew it. Not --I mean, we didn't have any plans, but I think we all knew --
3 Q No, no. 
4 A I mean, you know, it was --it was all over the internet. 
5 Q Okay. So we all --when you say we all knew it, when you --when you were 
6 sending those messages on January 5th, you had a pretty good hunch that people were 
7 going to go in the Capitol the next day. Is that fair? 
8 A I had --oh, yeah. I didn't know I was going to walk in there, but I knew that 
9 people were going to go in there, yes, because they --I mean, you know, the word was 
10 out there. 
11 Q Okay. You also sent messages about war tomorrow, and I believe war 
12 begins tomorrow for us. What --what war are you talking about? 
13 A I guess a revolutionary war, maybe. 
14 Q Why did you think there was going to be a revolutionary war? 
15 A I don't know. I just --I still think there is going to be --I mean, that's my 
16 opinion. I --1 --I just don't --I --I see it happen. 
17 Q So going into the Capitol was step one of the revolutionary war that you 
18 were thinking about? 
19 A I think that would have started it. Well, which it obviously didn't, but, you 
20 know --
21 Q Who is the war --who would the war be between? I guess that's why I'm 
22 confused. Who's the war between? 
23 A The government and the people. 
24 Q So am I included in the people? 
25 A Yeah, you're part of the people. I --I mean, you know, you're a --I guess  46 
1 you work for the government, I suppose, but you --you're not like an upper echelon, 
2 decision making government personnel, I guess. You know, you're like me. I hate to 
3 say it, but you're like me. You're a peon. You're a taxpayer. 
4 _, do you have any followup? 
-· Sorry, I was on mute. 
BY-: 
So you're saying that you thought there would be a civil war, correct? 5 
6 
7 
8 Q 
A No. I --I think the government wants there to be a civil war, but I --I think 
9 that there was going to be and is still going to be a revolutionary war. 
10 
11 war? 
12 
13 Q 
A 
Q Okay. So you're distinguishing between a civil war and a revolutionary 
There is a difference. 
There is. And you believe that on January 6th, something would happen 
14 that would spark a revolutionary war? 
15 
16 
17 A 
Q 
A A revo---yes, I do. 
And what did you think that event would be? 
I just --I mean, you know, the people were angry. They don't have trust in 
18 our government. I guess a lot of the American people that I know think we have a 
19 tyrannical government, and we believe it's our right to overthrow a tyrannical 
20 government. 
21 Q But what about January 6th specifically was going to be the beginning of that 
22 overthrow? 
23 A I --I guess it was if Mike Pence didn't --what do you call it --object to the 
24 electors, you know, it was going to make everybody mad. 
25 Q Okay. So -- 47 
1 A I don't know --I don't know exactly what happened that it did ended up 
2 getting breached, because I wasn't listening to what they were saying on the radio or 
3 whatever they were listening to. But, obviously, something didn't go right and that's 
4 why it was breached. 
5 Q Okay. But you mentioned specifically if Vice President Pence didn't stop 
6 the certification of the vote for President Trump. So are you saying essentially that the 
7 triggering event for the revolution would be the certification of the election for 
8 President Biden? 
9 
10 
11 A 
Q 
A Yes. 
And why did you believe that would start a revolution? 
Because a lot of what's been going on in our --in our voting history 
12 had --was exposed that year. I'm --you know, I'm not saying that the election was 
13 stolen from Donald Trump. What I'm saying is they're not run properly, and it was 
14 exposed --a lot of exposure that things weren't done properly that year. 
15 Q Okay. But if you don't think it was stolen, why do you think that certifying 
16 an election for the rightful winner would spark some sort of revolutionary moment? 
17 
18 A 
Q I don't think he's a rightful winner. 
Well, then help me understand that. If you don't think it was stolen, how 
19 can you also not think he was the rightful winner? 
20 A Well, I --I don't think it was stolen the way that the right-wing media puts it 
21 out there and the way that Trump puts it out there. I don't think it was run properly. 
22 think they used COVID to get votes in there that probably shouldn't have been in there. 
23 But there --I mean, there's --there's --I don't have any proof of it. 
24 Q Okay. Well, I'm not here to debate you on that point. I'm more just 
25 trying to figure out why you think that the election on --the certification of the election  48 
1 on January 6th was this revolutionary spark. 
2 A Because there were things done in some of the elections that were not legal. 
3 So you can't certify something that's not legal. 
4 Q Okay. And --and you are --in your view, 2020 was different than previous 
5 elections? 
6 A I paid more attention. There was a lot more brought out, I guess because I 
7 was paying attention. I don't know what happened previous years, but I'm sure, you 
8 know, that --that things haven't been right for a long time. I mean, I --you know, 
9 it's --it's like some of the people in Congress, they've been in there 35 years. So you're 
10 telling me that there's three generations of people that all think exactly alike to vote for 
11 the same person? That doesn't make sense to me. 
12 
13 
14 
15 Q All right. Well, putting that aside --
Mr. Munyer. Let me --let me stop for a second. 
-· Sure. 
Mr. Munyer. Is this the point of this to document what Doug believes? 
16 Because, I mean, obviously my client is not a sophisticated historian of the American 
17 process or the government. And it's obvious he doesn't even understand what 
18 happened when he was there at the Capitol or what was supposed to happen, right? 
19 And part of --part of his participation in this is based on a certain level of 
20 ignorance, right? And so is the purpose to question him and under---you know, he 
21 doesn't --he doesn't even know what these concepts mean. 
22 -· Mr. Munyer, I'm getting there in a second. I'm trying to tie his 
23 beliefs about the day back to the phrase "civil war," which is a pretty --
24 Mr. Munyer. No. I --I agree with you, but what we're talking about is tough 
25 talk on Facebook. We're not talking about --he's not the leader of a revolution. He  1 doesn't have followers. It's just Face book tough talk. 
2 And if we're all held responsible for something we write at 2:00 in the morning 
3 while on Face book and have to explain it, understandably, to a panel of very intelligent 
4 people who clearly don't agree with my client --which, again, who does? He doesn't 
5 even agree with what he wrote those days. But, I guess, are we documenting it or are 
6 we trying to --
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 Let me chime in. Let me chime in. 
Does your --does your client understand what war means? 
Mr. Munyer. Does he know what the word war means? Yes. But --but -­
Does he understand what the concept civil war means? 
~ He distinguished it from a revolutionary war. He clearly 
12 understands the difference. And what we're trying to do --and we're happy to go off 
13 the record and have this conversation. 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 Mr. Munyer. Yeah. Let's go off the record. 
-· All right. We'll go off the record at 3:28 p.m. 
[Discussion off the record.] 
We'll go back on the record at 3:31. 
Back over to you,-· 
Mr. Munyer. Okay. Go ahead. 
Thank you.

Q So where you --where were you hearing about these ideas that a 
23 revolutionary war would happen on January 6th? 49 
24 A I didn't hear that it was specifically going to be a revolutionary war, but what 
25 I do know is that everybody that I know and associate with do not trust the government.  1 
2 
3 Q 
A 
Q They don't --
They don't trust what's inside that circle over there. 
I understand that people might not trust the government, but where were 
4 you hearing specifically about the idea of a revolutionary war starting on January 6th? 50 
5 A Well, I don't know when I heard it, but I heard on news media outlets. I've 
6 seen Members of Congress --and I don't know which ones --but all say that --and I 
7 believe it's in the --it's somewhere --I don't know --maybe in the declaration of --I can't 
8 remember where it's at. In the Constitution, or something that's in the Constitution, 
9 that the people can take over what they consider a tyrannical government and abolish it. 
10 Q All right. What do you --what --
11 A And I see that happening, because I see a tyrannical government. My God, 
12 you can't even --I mean, they want to be in everything you do. 
13 Q 
14 January 6th? 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A So were you hearing these messages in the days and weeks leading up to 
I still hear them. 
Right. But I'm asking you -­
On TV. 
I'm asking you specifically in the lead-up to January 6th. 
Oh, yeah. 
Were you hearing --yes? 
Ever since COVID hit, it's --we've lost our trust in our government. 
Okay. 
You know, we're just tired, and, you know, people --and, you know, you 
24 watch on the --you see all these people at all these State houses and --you know, all 
25 these people coming together. All over the world, you see big rallies and protests  51 
1 and --I mean, you can see what's happening in this world, and the people are just tired of 
2 governments controlling their lives. 
3 
4 Q Well, thank you. -· 5 January 6th specific? 
6 Yeah. 
7 BY , do you have followup on that or should I stick to the 
8 Q Well, just, you know, on the COVID point, obviously the last 2 years have 
9 been incredibly difficult, and I imagine, like, from a business perspective, it's been really 
10 hard for you too. 
11 Did you go to any of those State protests --the State house protests that you were 
12 talking about back in 2020? 
13 A I remember being at the State house once, but I don't remember what it was 
14 for --what the protest was for. But I do remember going down there. 
15 I did go down --and I can't remember --this was a while ago. I can't remember 
16 when. I went down one time for a --a Second Amendment rally. Of course, I 
17 don't --I've had one gun in my life. It was a 12-gauge that I bought in the summer of 
18 2020 to protect my family. But I --I don't --I don't like guns. But I believe that you 
19 have a right to own a gun, you know. 
20 So I did go to --
21 
22 
23 
24 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
25 in office. Do you remember when --
1 did go to that rally for the Second Amendment, yes. 
Do you remember when that was? 
I can't remember exactly when, but I'm pretty sure it was when Trump was  1 
2 52 
Q Got it. No. I --yeah. 
A '16 and '19, I guess, because it --there was no mask or nothing, so it had to 
3 be pre-COVID. 
4 Q Sure. That's --that's helpful enough. I wasn't looking for a specific day. 
5 I was just trying to get a sense of whether it was close to, you know --whether it was in 
6 2020 or somewhere in there. 
7 
8 
9 
10 A No. It was pre-COVID. 
Q Got it. 
A I do remember no masks. 
Q Mr. Wright, I wanted to ask about the --the fight the blue comment that we 
11 were talking about a little while ago. Were there things that happened in D.C. during 
12 the November and December 2020 rallies that made you think that maybe the police 
13 weren't on your side? 
14 
15 A No. Now, I don't --
Q Can you help me understand why you thought that the police might not 
16 have been on your side on January 6th? 
17 A Yeah. I don't know if it's --if I meant me personally. And --and I probably 
18 wasn't even talking about me fighting the blue, because I can't fight my way out of a wet 
19 paper sac. You know, I just don't --I don't have any energy. I don't have the stamina. 
20 But I don't know. I can just feel the energy, even into just reading things, that 
21 people were going to do things they probably shouldn't do, you know. 
22 
23 Q 
A Uh-huh. 
I don't know. I just --I just knew it. I just knew it was coming. You 
24 know, with COVID --COVID really changed a lot of people's --it gave people a lot of time 
25 to think, a lot of time to get angry, because it --they --they --a lot of people were losing a  53 
1 lot of things that --you know, COVID really hurt us bad, as far as mentally and --1 guess 
2 I --I got aggravated, but I never --I never got violent. 
3 Look, not just that day, but previous, you know, at any of the events or anything 
4 like that. That's just not me. I'm sure there are people that were --that --that are like 
5 that, okay, but that's not me. And I don't know anybody that's --that's what you would 
6 call violent, you know. 
7 
8 Q 
A Did you see people fighting police officers on January 6th? 
No. Not --I did not. And I tell you, we really didn't know what happened 
9 as far as a lot of what we --a lot of what the country's seen --because they were 
10 watching it live, you know, all over the Nation. We were there. We didn't have that 
11 advantage. 
12 But when we got onto the bus, we seen what was happening on the west side of 
13 the building, and it wasn't pretty, you know. But we didn't see that where we were, you 
14 know, on the east side. We just --it just --I don't know --I mean, it wasn't 
15 there --number one, there was hardly --like I said, between 10,000 people, there was --I 
16 don't think I remember seeing more than 30 police along the fence line. 
17 Q So knowing what you know now, that, you know, people who were there 
18 to --to rally and protest, many of them did end up fighting with or beating or spraying 
19 bear spray on police officers, do you think that kind of violence is justified? 
20 A If they --if they brought that stuff, then they must have been prepared to 
21 use it. Now, I don't know who they planned on using it on, but I'm going to say, if you 
22 brought that shit with you or you brought a weapon or you brought whatever, then that 
23 must have been like 100 percent what you was going to do. 
24 But I can tell you, 99 percent of the people there were there just like me. They 
25 were pissed off and they wanted their voices to be heard, and we talk a lot of shit  54 
1 because we were mad. I mean, you know, the whole country was angry. You know, 
2 we --we sat and watched --
3 Q Mr. Wright, no. I understand, and I don't --I want to be respectful of your 
4 time, because I think we've heard --heard you say this a couple of times, so I just want to 
5 move on. 
6 You know, do you think violence against police officers was justified on 
7 January 6th? 
8 
9 
10 of. 
11 A 
Q 
A No. It's never justified. 
Well, then help me understand what you think a revolutionary war consists 
It --well, if it's a war, okay, it's --it's one side taking over another, just like 
12 what we've got going on right now over in Russia and Ukraine. You know, it's a war. 
13 Now, what you're doing is --with our government, what we think they're doing is 
14 wrong, okay? What --what can we do to fix that? 
15 Q You've told us that you think that war is coming, and it seems like you 
16 thought a war was coming on January 6th. What did --I mean, war implies violence, just 
17 like you said. So I --I'm struggling to understand what you expected to happen on 
18 January 6th. 
19 A I see the people of the United States getting sick of a tyrannical government. 
20 That's what I see. 
21 
22 Q 
A So Federal law enforcement officers who are part of the government -­
No, because I'm going to tell you, it's not the law enforcement officers. 
23 They're just like you and me. They're sitting on the bottom shelf, eating bread, just like 
24 you and me. It's the upper echelons that get away with everything and make all these 
25 decisions and don't ask us first. See, they don't -- Is violence against --
They don't know who they work for. 
--the violence against them justified? 55 
1 
2 
3 
4 Q 
A 
Q 
A Getting them out of office is justified, which means you can go up there and 
5 take them out of office, you're done, you're fired. 
6 See, you --it doesn't work that way because it can't, because they make the rules. 
7 
8 
9 out. 
10 Q 
A 
Q Is violence against Members of Congress justified? 
No, not violence, but you should be able to get to them and tell them to get 
Then what is --what is the war that you're talking about? If it's not against 
11 police officers, if it's not against Members of Congress, who is it against? 
12 A It depends on what --you know, it is against Members of Congress, I guess. 
13 And not just them, but, you know, some of the --I don't know what you call 
14 them --appointees or what --the CDC and --you know, they make all these decisions to 
15 affect our life, but they don't ask us. 
16 Well, you know what? You're not my boss, okay? I don't work --you 
17 don't --you work for me. I don't work for you. I don't do what you tell me to do. It 
18 doesn't work that way. That --this is free America. I mean, if we're not breaking the 
19 law, we do what we want to do. 
20 
21 
22 Q 
A 
Q So --
It's not --it's not working that way. 
I don't want to belabor the point, but I'm just trying to understand. You're 
23 talking about war, and you say that Members of Congress and political appointees are the 
24 target. So --
25 A And you're talking about -- 56 
1 Q So you're saying --I'm asking you if you think that violence against Members 
2 of Congress or political appointees is part of this war that you're talking about? 
3 A That --that --you're asking me about something that I made a post on a year 
4 and a half ago. I can't give you specifics on what I was thinking that particular day. 
5 can tell you what I'm thinking today, right now at this moment. 
6 Q Sure. You've talked about the fact that --
7 
8 
9 
10 A 
Q 
A 
Q And I was getting to it. 
--you think that a revolutionary war is coming -­
It is. 
--so I'm asking you --and does that involve violence against Members of 
11 Congress and political appointees? 
12 A I don't know if it does or it doesn't. I didn't say I was bringing a war. I said 
13 there is a war coming. I don't know what it involves. 
14 Q The day --so, Mr. Wright, when --when did you see videos after --you 
15 know, after you left the Capitol and you first saw videos of what happened? 
16 
17 
18 A 
Q 
A We seen them on the bus in Union Station. 
Can you give me like a --was that the same day, the evening? 
It was 3 o'clock, or 3:15, or whenever I got to the bus and people started 
19 gathering at the bus. 
20 Q So on the next day, it looks like in the afternoon, you said: It's fucking 
21 wartime, no more protesting. 
22 So you knew that people had beaten law enforcement officers. You knew that 
23 people threatened the lives of Members of Congress. And the day afterwards, you said: 
24 It's fucking wartime, no more protesting. 
25 So help me understand what --what you were thinking at that time, because you  57 
1 knew --you're telling us that you knew that people beat police officers and targeted 
2 Members of Congress. Twenty-four hours later, you said, "It's fucking wartime." What 
3 does that mean? 
4 A I don't know exactly what it meant when I stated it, but I guess what it 
5 means is it's --it's time to straighten our government out. That's what it means. 
6 Me personally, myself, if --if somebody in that circle over there told me that it 
7 was raining outside and I was standing there and it was dripping on me, I still wouldn't 
8 believe it. I don't believe anything that comes out of their mouths over there. 
9 Our --our government is corrupt, and we the people know it. We just have to 
10 figure out what to do about it. Obviously, violence isn't going to work and, obviously, 
11 voting isn't going to work. So we the people need to figure out what we have to do to 
12 get our lives back to live like American citizens. We just don't know what we have to do. 
13 Q You don't know what you have to do. But the day after January 6th, you 
14 say, "It's fucking wartime" --
15 A That's 14 months ago. I don't know what I said four---I just told you I 
16 don't remember what I was talking about. 
17 
18 
19 
20 Q 
A 
Q 
A I am telling you what you said. 
Okay. And I don't --
We can pull up the exhibit. 
I don't --I don't disagree with you. It's right there in black and white. I'm 
21 reading it. But what I meant by it, I can't answer the question. 
22 Q Well, what do you think --read the words to me. 
23 
24 Q Well, we'll take --we'll take --let's --we'll take --we'll take it --the reason 
25 why we ask these questions is to see if there's more color to it than what we think there  58 
1 might be just reading it off the face of the paper. But it sounds like reading it off the 
2 face of the paper and construing it that way is the way we should move forward. Is that 
3 fair, Mr. Wright? 
4 
5 
6 
7 A 
Q 
A 
Q I didn't understand --
Civil war --
--that statement, but --
We're trying to get color. We're trying to understand why you're saying 
8 civil war, why you're talking --
9 A No, no. I can't answer the question, because I couldn't tell you what we 
10 talked about at the beginning of this conversation. 
11 
12 Q Okay. Okay. 
I'm sorry. , I'm sorry for cutting you off. Did you 
13 have anything there? 
16 
17 -· Yeah. Let me just ask one or two followup. 
So I won't read through all the Facebook messages, but it sounds like you believed 
18 that whatever was going to happen on January 6th was preplanned. So I'm wondering 
19 where you got that idea. 
20 Mr. Wright. I don't --I don't believe it was preplanned. I mean, I don't know if 
21 it was or wasn't. I shouldn't say I don't believe. But I know the American people have 
22 had enough. 
23 
24 
25 -· Okay. Then let me read one message then. 
Early morning January 6th, you say: All planned out. 
So are you --did you believe that something was happening on January 6th?  59 
1 Mr. Wright. As I stated earlier, I --you know, I don't know what they show you in 
2 there, but I believe that had something to do with the tunnels. That's --I don't know 
3 who it was, but I seen where somebody had the tunnels covered. 
4 Mr. Munyer. And let me just say --one second. The --those excerpts used in 
5 the complaint are part of much larger conversations. The FBI has all that. And when 
6 we sat down with them, they showed us the full transcripts of it, and he explained some 
7 of the context you guys are asking where he can't explain today. As far as who he was 
8 talking to and in what those specific statements were in reference to, some of that's 
9 explained in the rest of the conversation that's not part of those complaints. 
10 Understood. 
11 BY-: 
12 Q So --but in terms of that --that's helpful that you think it was about the 
13 tunnels. Where were you --where were you seeing all this information about tunnels? 
14 A The only social media I had. 
15 Q Facebook? 
16 A Face book. 
17 Q And do you remember talking to other people who believed that there was a 
18 plan on January 6th to use tunnels? 
19 A I don't remember talking to anybody about it, but I --I --I do remember 
20 seeing something about it, and I do remember, I guess, having a Facebook conversation, 
21 you know, saying, well, I --I don't even know where I seen it at, but whatever. But, you 
22 know, somebody says that they're going to be at the tunnels. 
23 Q Okay. So it was your belief, then, that individuals or groups of individuals 
24 on January 6th would be using the tunnels on January 6th. Is that correct? 
25 A Yes. I -- 1 
2 Q Okay. 
A It is my belief that there were people that planned on overtaking the 
3 building. It is my belief, okay? I don't have any proof of it, but I do believe that. 
Q Thank you. 60 
4 
5 A Because of some of the things that we seen, even still seeing today, like you 
6 said, the guys in the tactical gear with the zip-tie handcuffs --I think the one guy was in 
7 the building, stepping over chairs with zip-tie handcuffs and --I mean, people don't carry 
8 that shit every day, you know. 
9 I'm sure --I'm sure there were people --and I don't know if it was people, groups, 
10 whatever. I'm not sure. I know in my heart that there were people that planned on 
11 what happened happening. 
12 Q Right. And do you believe that those people were planning on starting the 
13 kind of revolutionary war that you mentioned involving, you know, getting those 
14 Members of Congress out one way or another? 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 A I do. 
Q Okay. Thank you. 
A I believe they were going to take them out of office. 
Q Thank you. 
And do you believe that the plan had anything to do with President Trump? 
A 
Q 
A Did he plan it, you mean? 
No, no. Sorry. Let me rephrase. Just that --
1 think that --I know what you're saying. I think he probably influenced it, 
23 you know, by his speaking. But he definitely didn't direct it. 
24 Q Actually --well, I appreciate that answer. I was actually asking whether the 
25 people who planned to go into the Capitol on January 6th were doing so for a war for  61 
1 President Trump. 
2 So one individual you talked with on January 6th said, I believe war begins 
3 tomorrow for Trump. 
4 So was it --was that part of the plan, to fight for Trump? 
5 
6 
7 A 
Q 
A I said that or the other person said that? 
Another person said that. 
No, I don't think there was --I don't think there was a war for Trump, no. 
8 mean, I don't know who said it, you know. And I obviously can't tell you what they were 
9 thinking, but --
10 Q Right. So --
11 A You know, I don't think it was --it was --I don't think any of it was done for 
12 Trump. Maybe --maybe --maybe for him to benefit maybe, but I don't think it was 
13 done --I mean, it was obviously about we, the people. It wasn't about Donald Trump. 
14 Q Well, earlier we talked --I believe you answered the question of part of the 
15 reason for January 6th was to stop the certification of the vote for President Biden. So 
16 do you think that was --if that was part of the plan, do you think part of the plan was to 
17 help President Trump keep power? 
18 
19 A 
Q 
20 in power? 
21 A I guess, to keep him in Presidency? Yeah. 
Okay. And was that part of the revolutionary war, to keep President Trump 
I don't believe, no. I think --I don't think so. I don't think it was --I think 
22 it was that more of we the people don't believe in the government. 
23 Q So --
24 So President Trump --if former President Trump would have been 
25 declared the winner of the election, would you have come to D.C. on January 6th?  62 
1 Mr. Wright. If he asked us to, absolutely. You know --and I've said it a 
2 thousand times --and obviously not to you guys --Trump is an arrogant asshole, okay? 
3 As a person, I probably wouldn't be able to stand him. I don't think I could deal with him 
4 on a daily basis. But I believe in what he believes in as far as the country goes. 
5 As far as a person --I personally don't know any multimillionaires or billionaires, 
6 you know, and I'm sure that they look at things a lot differently than you and I do. But 
7 arrogance? He's got a lot of it, you know. Does he like to lose? No, he don't like to 
8 lose. And I don't think any of us like to lose. 
9 But I think what he did is --is he exposed a lot of what happens in our government 
10 that shouldn't happen to the American people, and that's why --you know, and then 
11 obviously the followers of Donald Trump, they heard him say, well, you know, if I don't 
12 get --if he gets in and I'm not in, this is what's going to happen. You know, and the 
13 people got scared, you know, of all the things that he said would happen if Joe Biden got 
14 in office. 
15 But the bad part is that things really did happen, exactly like he told us. Because 
16 I don't think Trump is corrupt. But I do believe 90 percent of that circle is. 
17 
18 Q BY-: 
So fair to say, then, that President Trump espoused fears that you think are 
19 sympathetic to or similar to what you're calling we, the people, who want to fight against 
20 a tyrannical government? 
21 
22 A 
Q Yes. 
And do you believe that message influenced people who were ready to fight 
23 for a revolutionary war? 
24 A I guess if that's the kind of person you are. You know, in a war, there 
25 is --it's just like anything else. There's different positions for different people, you  63 
1 know, so not everybody goes out there and kills people or carries weapons or --you 
2 know, there's --there's people that cook, people that nurse. So not everybody's got 
3 violent tendencies. 
4 Now, why they use their violent tendencies, I can't answer. I'm not them people. 
5 I know I don't have violent tendencies, so that's why I didn't use violent tendencies. But 
6 I can't answer for other people. 
7 I know why I was there, and that's because he called me there, and he laid out 
8 what is happening in our government. He laid it out, you know. 
9 Now, you may be different than me. You may not believe what he says. I do 
10 believe --when he's talking policy and when he's talking about the government, I do 
11 believe in what he says. 
12 As a person, I don't think I would like him, no. You know, I'm not --I don't like 
13 him because he's Donald Trump. I like him because of --of what he puts out to the 
14 American people. 
15 Q Right. I'm just trying to figure out that --it sounds like there's two things 
16 that you think were going on on January 6th: people trying to keep Trump in power, 
17 and people trying to --you know, thinking a revolutionary war would spark. And the 
18 way you're describing it, I'm struggling to see how they're different. So do you think 
19 they overlap --
20 
21 
22 A 
Q 
A Well--
--at the very least? 
You know, I've always said that when people think something's fun, you 
23 know, you'll get a million people. But when they think something's going to happen 
24 that's not so fun, you'll be lucky to get 25 people, you know, because 99 percent of the 
25 American people sit and talk about the same thing over the --the breakfast table, but  64 
1 only 2 percent of them act on what they talk about. 
2 And that's what happened that day, is everybody that went there was pissed off. 
3 Some of them used their brains and some of them didn't. 
4 Now, I --me, I --I --I obviously didn't use my brain, because I walked in the door 
5 and walked back out. That's why I'm where I'm at today. If I hadn't have done that, 
6 you probably wouldn't even know who I am. You know, you wouldn't be talking to me 
7 today. 
Q Okay. Well, thank you. 8 
9 -· , do you have any followup on that or do you want to 
10 move on to the --
11 I don't. I don't have --I have a few --just a few additional 
12 questions about January 6th. 
13 BY 
14 Q It sounded like you didn't go to the Ellipse rally where President Trump was, 
15 but did you believe that President Trump was going to come to the Capitol on 
16 January 6th? 
17 A I didn't know if he was or he wasn't. Actually, I --I don't even know if I 
18 knew that day that he had planned on it. But I did hear in his speech later, because 
19 obviously I didn't hear his speech that day, that he said, we are going to walk to the 
20 Capitol now. But he didn't, obviously. 
21 Q And --and why did you actually --I know you went in for a few minutes. So 
22 why did you actually leave the Capitol? 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A Why did I go in? 
No. Why did you leave when you left? 
I think when I was in there is when I heard about Ashli Babbitt getting shot.  1 I think I was in the building, or just out of it, or just coming out, or something, but --
2 Q You were just entering right when she was being shot, and --so, yes, that's 
3 correct. 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 A Yeah. 
Q So that played into your decision to leave the Capitol? 
A It did. 
Q And so that's a part of the video that --actually, it might be helpful. 
Let's play exhibit 4 real quick, and it's just like a 30-second clip. 
[Video shown.] 
BY 
Q So this is the east side door that you came in, I believe. And it's the same 
12 door you leave out of. That's you walking from the rotunda --
13 
14 
15 
16 A That's coming out. 
Q --in the red sweatshirt. 
Coming out, exactly. 
So there's people walking out at this point, and that's why I was wondering, why 65 
17 are you all walking out at this point? And was there discussions about Ms. Ashli Babbitt 
18 going on around there? 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 A I don't think there was in the building. I think I heard it when I got outside. 
Q Okay. 
A But I --I --I don't think I spoke to anybody in the building. 
Q Okay. ~ Thank you, - You can take this down. 
BY 
Q I see the crowd of people walking out after you, so that's why I was curious.  1 
2 
3 A Well, I don't know. Maybe they didn't like me. 
I don't know. I can't answer that question. 
Q Coming to --coming to D.C. on January 6th, did you think that former 66 
4 President Trump was going to have some big reveal of some sort that he was going to talk 
5 about? 
6 A He did say that he was going to reveal something that day, yes. Did he? 
7 don't think he did. I don't know. Like I said, I don't think he did. 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 Q But you were expecting that as you --
A Yes. 
Q --cametoD.C.? 
A Yes. Yes. 
Does that --did that trigger any followup? 
BY 
Q Mr. Wright, you said you heard Trump say that he was going to reveal 
15 something? 
16 A I --I don't know if I heard him say it out of his mouth or if I read it, but I did 
17 hear that he was going to reveal something big that day. 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 Q Got it. And do you have a sense of what that was going to be? 
A 
Q I have no clue. No clue. 
Did you have --do you remember if you had any ideas on what it could be? 
A No. I really don't think I had any idea. 
Q Got it. I have a question that's kind of related to what we were talking 
23 about a little while ago. And since you're from Ohio, I wanted to ask. You mentioned, 
24 you know, your concerns with public health officials, like folks at the CDC. Is that 
25 correct? Am I remembering that correctly?  Yes. 
Are you familiar with Amy Acton? 
She's a doctor, correct? 
Yeah. She was the --67 
1 
2 
3 
4 
5 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Was --she was --I don't know --I don't know what position, but she was like 
6 DeWine's doctor or --you know what I mean. In that circle. 
7 Q That's right. Exactly. So she was the chief health adviser for 
8 Governor De Wine towards the beginning of the pandemic. 
9 Do you --did you, you know, participate in protests against her, that sort of thing? 
10 
11 A 
Q No. 
Okay. You know, protests against COVID-related lockdowns, do you see 
12 those as kind of connected to the protests in November and December? You mentioned 
13 you had concerns about, you know, general function of government, your concerns about 
14 tyranny, right? 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Okay. 
Is this all sort of, you know, connected for you? 
Yeah, it's all connected. 
Got it. 
I mean, that's part of the overreach of the government, is the --you know, 
20 this is what you can and can't do, or this is what you have to do. And I probably 
21 shouldn't even say it on air, but I'm going to, but I tell people all the time, I only got to do 
22 three things in life, and that's eat, sleep, and shit. Everything else is my choice. 
23 
24 
25 Q Fair enough. 
, I'll turn it back to you. 
Yeah. So this is a question probably for Mr. Munyer. I just  68 
1 wanted to get a brief summary of the current status of Mr. Wright's case. 
2 Mr. Munyer. Yeah. So obviously he was indicted. He was arrested. 
3 believe he was indicted on nine counts, two felonies, seven misdemeanors. He was 
4 arrested here in Akron or in Canton at his home, and then he was taken to a local Federal 
5 court. And then he --we did an arraignment. He was released on detention. 
6 He's been on a GPS tether for the last year and a half. We've been going through 
7 extensive discovery. Original AUSA was out of Utah named Jacob Strain. He and I 
8 worked together through most of discovery, lots and lots and lots of stuff. Obviously, 
9 you're well aware of that. 
10 And then, recently, they switched to another AUSA that's local to D.C. named 
11 Laura Hill. Her and I are now working together on finishing the discovery, 
12 simultaneously plea negotiations and that kind of stuff --
13 Okay. 
14 Mr. Munyer. --and mitigation packets, and --and so we're --you know, we're 
15 moving towards, you know, hopefully having some kind of resolution at some point. 
16 Sounds good. That's what I was wondering --and you answered 
17 it --whether there was any plea negotiations --
18 
19 
20 Mr. Munyer. Yeah. We're -­
--ongoing. 
Mr. Munyer. Yeah. We --we don't want to go to trial. We never wanted to 
21 go to trial. He's not trying to say he was right. He knows he's wrong. 
22 
23 
24 
25 Okay. That makes sense. Thank you. 
Mr. Munyer. That's it. 
BY 
Q So these are just like our final questions, and --what we like to ask every  69 
1 witness, Mr. Wright --literately every witness, whether it be someone that went in the 
2 Capitol or someone that, you know, helped planned the rallies. Anyone, we like to ask: 
3 What are your thoughts now about January 6th looking back? 
4 A Well, I think of it two different ways. The first way is, if I had known what 
5 was happening, I would have stayed home. The second way is I wished it could have 
6 happened without the violence, but I wish we could have got the job done. 
7 
8 Q 
A The job as in stopping the certification of the vote? 
As in fixing our government. I don't know how to --like I said, you know, 
9 we still don't know how to do it. It's obviously not violence, and it's obviously not 
10 voting, but our government is out of control. And I'm not --you know, it's not a right 
11 and left thing. It's --it's --it's a in the circle thing. 
12 We don't really --I mean, I don't know about all States. Ohio, we don't really 
13 have a lot of overreach from our government, other than we had a little bit of problem 
14 with DeWine during COVID with overreaching. But --but, you know, people just want to 
15 live their life, mind their own business, do what they want to do. They don't want 
16 government in everything they do. 
17 You know, we --we don't want the government's money. We want to make our 
18 own money. 
19 
20 
21 
22 Q 
A 
Q 
23 followup. That's something we can debate another time. 
I don't want their money. 
I want them to pay for roads --for the roads at least. 
But, , can you --it looks like you have some 
24 Mr. Wright. If it's going to go on roads, yeah. But it's not their money, 
25 remember? It's our money that's going on the roads, not their money.  1 
2 ? 70 
Yeah. And I wasn't trying to debate you on it.  71 
1 
2 [4:08 p.m.] 
3 ____ Well, I just wanted to try to understand what you meant by get 
4 the job done. You said you wished you had gotten the job done on January 6th. And 
5 I'm not sure I understand what that entails. You know, you said fix the government, 
6 but --you wanted to fix the government on that particular day? 
7 Mr. Munyer. Well, let me just --I'm going to say a statement, see, because I've 
8 talked to him at length about this, with the prosecutors on this, and the FBI on this 
9 matter, which is, Doug does not really understand the government. He knows it's 
10 broken. He sees lobbyists and money and lifetime politicians as the problem. He does 
11 not know what a solution is to that problem, but he thinks that problem, if it could be 
12 fixed somehow, would benefit all of America. 
13 
14 
15 
16 Mr. Wright. That's pretty much, he wrapped it up right there. 
Mr. Munyer. But, obviously, violence doesn't fix it, which is why he's indicted. 
Mr. Wright. And I'm --
That's helpful, Mr. Munyer. But I'm trying to understand what 
17 "get the job done" means. 
18 
19 Mr. Munyer. Fix the government. 
Mr. Wright. Well, you tell --you know what, you tell me what the job would be 
20 to fix our government. 
21 BY 
22 Q Well, I'm trying to understand, because earlier today, you told us that you 
23 wanted Mike Pence to stop the certification of the election. 
24 A I said the people wanted that, yes. That's --that was the whole goal, I 
25 believe. My belief was for him to stop the certification, yes.  1 
2 Q 
A 72 
So is that --is that getting the job done? 
I mean, it was our understanding --it was told --yes, that would've got 
3 the --it was told to us that he had the power. Does he have the power? I don't know. 
4 I don't know. You know, that's --
5 Q If people dragged Mike Pence out because he didn't stop the certification of 
6 the election, would that be getting the job done? 
7 A No. I did see where people, you know, had gavels or whatever they call 
8 that thing. You know, that shit ain't me. I went there because I was called there. 
9 Yes, I walked in the building, and I left. I didn't have any plans to do anything. And 
10 today, I still don't have any plans to do anything to anybody. But I know something 
11 needs done to fix our government. 
12 Now, I just asked you, and you can't even answer the question, so how are you 
13 expecting me to answer how to fix our government? 
14 Q Well, I'm not here to --you know, I'm not here to debate you on politics. 
15 I'm just trying to understand --
16 A Well, no, I'm not talking about politics. I'm saying is, I don't have thoughts 
17 in my head on how I'm going to fix it, because I ain't got a clue. 
18 Q I mean, we do have a sense of what your thoughts were at the time. You 
19 know, we asked you what you meant by "the first mistake they make in Chambers, we are 
20 going in and drag him out." 
21 
22 A 
Q And I told you, I don't remember. 
Well, I believe you told one of my colleagues --and I apologize if I 
23 misheard --but I believe you said that was in reference to Mike Pence. 
24 
25 A 
Q Not decertifying, yes. 
So if Mike Pence didn't decertify the election, you would go in and drag him  1 out? 
2 
3 
4 
5 stairs. 
6 A 
Q 
A Me, personally? 
You said we. 
Okay. But I wasn't personally going to do it, no. I barely made it up the 
Mr. Munyer. All right. 
7 - What he's saying is he was never participating or going to participate in any 
8 violence against anybody. I think he's been clear on that. But, I mean, I understand 73 
9 your position. What I'm saying is, I could cross-examine him into answering a question 
10 any way I want him to, because my client is not sophisticated, and he doesn't even know 
11 what these words mean. 
12 So when you say "decertify," "certify," "power," "not power," "government," 
13 these are all just things. When you read them on Facebook, it's not the same as going to 
14 law school about it. And, unfortunately, his sophistication level is not there, and so he 
15 doesn't --I've dug in on this for hours, and the answer isn't in here. 
16 
17 All right. , I'll turn it back to you. 
I have a --this is just a housekeeping issue. We noticed there 
18 was someone in the office. Who was in the office? 
19 
20 
21 Mr. Munyer. Oh, that's --that's my client's wife. 
~ Okay. 
Mr. Munyer. She works with him in the business, and we thought there was 
22 going to be more questions about the business and who was on the bus. And she has a 
23 better memory about stuff like that, so in case you had --
24 Got it. 
25 Mr. Munyer. --special questions that we needed to answer, I told her to attend.  1 
2 74 
Got it, got it. Okay. 
Well, we've covered a lot of topics here today, Mr. Wright, Mr. Munyer. Is there 
3 anything that we're missing that you think we should know? 
4 
5 
6 
7 Mr. Munyer. I don't think so. I appreciate it, guys. Thank you. 
- All right. Thank you. Appreciate it. Bye. 
Mr. Munyer. All right. Have a good one.
