(b) Applicants must certify and 
provide adequate proof that the 
expenses incurred to eligible fruit trees, 
bushes, or vines occurred during the 
applicable disaster period and that the 
loss or damage was a direct result of a 
2005 hurricane, as set forth in § 
760.101. 
(c) The quantity and kind of fruit 
trees, bushes, or vines that died or were 
damaged as a result of the applicable 
disaster may be documented by; 
purchase records; bank or other loan 
documents; Federal Emergency 
Management Agency and National 
Guard records; IRS records; property tax 
records; private insurance documents; 
and similar documents. 
§ 760.504 Payment calculation. 
(a) TIP payments shall be calculated 
by multiplying the following national 
payment rate for the applicable tier by 
the number of eligible acres, excluding 
but not limited to such things as 
drainage ditches and canals, in a stand 
of fruit trees, bushes, or vines by the 
producer's share in such crop: 
(1) Tier I-$750; 
(2) Tier II-$300; 
(3) Tier III-$200; and 
(4) Tier IV-$90. 
(b) If the actual expenses incurred for 
damage are greater than the value 
associated with the tier based on the 
location of the stand, the applicant may 
submit documentation to FSA to request 
the stand be placed in the next lower­
numbered tier which represents a 
greater level of loss and a higher 
payment rate. Regardless of the 
expenses incurred the stand can only be 
placed in the next lower-numbered tier. 
Subpart G-Aquaculture Program 
§ 760.601 Funds availability. 
FSA will provide block grants to the 
states of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, 
Mississippi, North Carolina and Texas 
where aquaculture was adversely 
affected by 2005 hurricanes as set forth 
in § 760.101. Producers in eligible 
counties in those states who raise 
aquaculture species in a controlled 
environment as part of a farming 
operation and who have not received 
assistance under other disaster programs 
for the same aquaculture losses are 
eligible to receive these funds. Funds 
provided by a State to a farming 
operation under such a grant shall not 
exceed $80,000. 
Subpart H-2006 Livestock Assistance 
Grant Program 
§ 760.701 Funds availability. 
FSA will administer a limited 
program to provide assistance to 
livestock producers where forage was adversely affected by drought in 
counties reaching D3 or D4 Drought on 
the U.S. Drought Monitor, during March 
7 to August 31, 2006, in the States of: 
Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, 
Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana, 
Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, 
Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North 
Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, 
Wisconsin and Wyoming. Under the 
Livestock Assistance Grant Program, 
FSA will provide grants to the State 
governments of these States to assist 
livestock producers who suffered forage 
losses as part of a farming operation in 
eligible counties. The amount of each 
grant will be based on the number of 
adult beef cattle and sheep from each 
eligible county uniformly prorated to 
insure that available funding is not 
exceeded. Producers in eligible counties 
in those States who suffered forage 
losses as part of a farming operation are 
eligible for assistance under these 
grants. Among other conditions of these 
grants, assistance provided by a State 
under such a grant to an applicant shall 
not exceed $10,000, except for general 
partnerships and joint ventures in 
which case assistance shall not exceed 
$10,000 times the number of members 
that constitute the general partnership 
or joint venture.

BILLING CODE 3410-05-P 
FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION 
11 CFR Part 104 
[Notice 2006-23] 
Statement of Policy: "Purpose of 
Disbursement" Entries for Filings With 
the Commission 
AGENCY: Federal Election Commission. 
ACTION: Statement of Policy. 
SUMMARY: Political committees and 
other persons required to file campaign 
finance reports with the FEC must 
itemize certain disbursements and, for 
each itemized disbursement, must 
provide information including a brief 
description of the purpose of the 
disbursement. The "purpose of 
disbursement" entry, when considered 
along with the identity of the 
disbursement recipient, must be 
sufficiently specific to make the purpose 
of the disbursement clear. The guidance 
below includes a non-exhaustive list of 
"purpose of disbursement" entries that 
are generally acceptable, and a non-exhaustive list of terms that are 
generally not acceptable. 
DATES: Effective as of January 9, 2007. 
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 
Richard T. Ewell, Attorney, 999 E Street, 
NW., Washington, DC 20463, (202) 694-
1650 or (800) 424-9530, or Debbie 
Chacona, Branch Chief, Party/Non-Party 
Branch, Reports Analysis Division, 999 
E Street, NW., Washington, DC 20463, 
(202) 694-1130 or (800) 424-9530. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Political 
committees and other persons required 
to file campaign finance reports with the 
FEC must itemize certain disbursements 
and, for each itemized disbursement, 
must provide the full name and address 
of the recipient, the date the 
disbursement was made, and a brief 
statement or description of why the 
disbursement was made. See 2 U.S.C. 
434(b); 11 CFR 104.3(b)(3) and (4), 
104.10(b)(4), 104.17(b)(3) and 
300.36(b)(2)(iii). The "purpose of 
disbursement" entry, when considered 
along with the identity of the 
disbursement recipient, must be 
sufficiently specific to make the purpose 
of the disbursement clear. 11 CFR 
104.3(b)(3)(i)(B) and (4)(i)(A). The 
Commission's regulation requiring a 
description of the purpose of each 
itemized disbursement includes 
examples of descriptions that are 
acceptable (e.g., "dinner expenses," 
"salary," "travel expenses") and 
examples that are unacceptable (e.g., 
"advance," "miscellaneous"). Neither 
list is exhaustive. 
The Commission solicited comments 
on a draft of this policy statement on 
November 2, 2006. Two comments were 
received. After reviewing the comments 
received, the Commission has decided 
to publish the policy statement with one 
change. As suggested by a commenter, 
the Commission has added "Consulting­
Political" to the examples of generally 
insufficient descriptions. In light of this 
change, the Commission has also added 
examples of descriptions that would be 
generally sufficient, such as 
"Consulting-Media," "Consulting­
Fundraising," "Consulting-Polling," 
"Consulting-Legal" and "Consulting­
Get-Out-The-Vote." 
The Commission recognizes that the 
"purpose of disbursement" entries, 
when linked to information provided 
about the recipient of the payment, may 
provide sufficient disclosure. For 
example, a disbursement to an office 
supply vendor for the stated purpose of 
"Supplies" provides adequate and 
acceptable disclosure, while a 
disbursement to a committee staff 
member for the same purpose of 
"Supplies" would likely trigger a  888 Federal Register / Vol. 72, No. 5 / Tuesday, January 9, 2007 / Rules and Regulations 
request for a more complete description 
of the purpose of the disbursement. In 
the former case, it is obvious to the 
reader what type of supplies were 
purchased, while in the latter case, it is 
not. 
As a rule of thumb, filers should 
consider the following question: "Could 
a person not associated with the 
committee easily discern why the 
disbursement was made when reading 
the name of the recipient and the 
purpose?" For example, a person not 
associated with the committee could not 
easily discern the purpose of a 
disbursement made to a vendor for 
"Consulting" (unless the vendor's name 
makes the purpose clear, e.g., Smith 
Fundraising Consulting, Inc.). As 
discussed above, however, if the 
committee were to provide additional 
detail with respect to the type of 
consulting the vendor provided (e.g., 
"Fundraising Consulting"), an 
unassociated person would have no 
difficultly discerning the purpose of the 
disbursement. 
All information on campaign finance 
reports submitted to the FEC, including 
the entries for "purpose of 
disbursement," are reviewed by analysts 
in the Reports Analysis Division (RAD). 
Some campaign finance reports, 
particularly those filed by presidential 
campaign committees accepting public 
funding, are also reviewed by auditors 
in the Audit Division. In practice, the 
RAD analysts and the auditors often 
encounter "purpose of disbursement" 
entries that are not listed in the 
examples contained in 11 CFR 
104.3(b)(3) and (4), and receive 
questions from filers regarding 
acceptable descriptions. Therefore, in 
order to provide further guidance to 
filers and to encourage consistency 
between filers, the Commission is 
publishing lists of additional generally 
acceptable and generally unacceptable 
descriptions. 
The Commission does not intend to 
request that a committee provide 
additional information about a purpose 
of disbursement entry if the committee 
uses those descriptions listed below as 
providing sufficient detail. However, if 
a committee uses a description that is 
listed as lacking sufficient detail, a RAD 
analyst may review the report more 
closely but the Commission would not 
automatically take any particular action. 
In most instances, the Commission will 
merely contact the reporting committee 
and the committee may then amend its 
report. In the rare circumstances in 
which the Commission deems it 
necessary to pursue the matter further, 
the Commission will conduct a separate 
review of the sufficiency of the description of purpose to determine 
whether it meets the requirements of 11 
CFR 104.3(b). 
Any future revisions to these lists will 
be posted on the Commission's Web site 
at http:! /www.fec.gov/law!policy.shtml. 
Committees with questions can contact 
either their assigned RAD analyst 
(phone: (800) 424-9530 (press 5)) or the 
FEC Information Division (phone: (800) 
424-9530 (press 6); e-mail: 
info@fec.gov). 
Descriptions of purpose that provide 
sufficient detail: 
• "Salary" for a disbursement to a 
staff member. 
• "Media" for a disbursement to a 
television or radio communication 
company. 
• "Polling" for a disbursement to a 
research/communications company. 
• "Travel," "Travel Expenses," or 
"Travel Expense Reimbursement" for a 
disbursement to a staff member. 
• "Printing" for a disbursement to a 
printing company. 
• "Phone Banks" for a disbursement 
to a vendor providing phone bank 
services. 
• "Dinner Expense" for a 
disbursement to a restaurant. 
• "Catering Cost" for a disbursement 
to a hotel or restaurant where a 
fundraiser was held. 
• "Party Fees" or "Party Annual 
Dues" for a disbursement to a National 
Party Committee for their annual dues. 
• "Exit Polling," "Door-to-Door Get­
Out-the-Vote," "Get-Out-the-Vote Phone 
Calls," or "Driving Voters to the Polls" 
to individuals or vendors contracted for 
get-out-the-vote or voter registration 
activity. 
• "Supplies" for a disbursement to an 
office supply vendor. 
• "Consultant-Media," "Consultant­

14 CFR Part 39 
[Docket No. FAA-2005-22696; Directorate 
Identifier 2005-SW-22-AD; Amendment 39-
14877; AD 2007-01-06]

Airworthiness Directives; Bell 
Helicopter Textron Canada Model 
206A, B, L, L-1, L-3, and L-4 
Helicopters 
AGENCY: Federal Aviation 
Administration, DOT. 
ACTION: Final rule. 
SUMMARY: This amendment supersedes 
an existing airworthiness directive (AD) 
for the specified Bell Helicopter Textron 
Canada (BHTC) model helicopters. The 
existing AD currently requires certain 
inspections and checks of the tail rotor 
blade (blade) for a deformation, a crack, 
and a bent or deformed tail rotor weight 
(weight). Also, that AD requires, before 
further flight, replacing each blade with 
an airworthy blade if a deformation, a 
crack, or a bent or deformed weight is 
found. This action contains the same 
actions as the existing AD and also adds 
to the applicability certain serial­
numbered blades inadvertently omitted 
from the current AD. This action also 
requires replacing each affected blade, 
which is a terminating action. This 
amendment is prompted by three 
reports of skin cracks originating near 
the blade trailing edge balance weight. 
The actions specified by this AD are 
intended to prevent blade failure and 
subsequent loss of control of the 
helicopter. DATES: Effective February 13, 2007. 
ADDRESSES: You may get the service 
information identified in this AD from

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A 
proposal to amend 14 CFR part 39 by 
superseding AD 2004-24-08, 
Amendment 39-13884 (69 FR 69810, 
December 1, 2004), for the specified 
BHTC model helicopters was published 
in the Federal Register on October 17, 
2005 (70 FR 60246). This action 
contains the same actions as the existing 
AD. Also, when we issued AD 2004-24-
08, we intentionally did not include the 
long-term requirement (no later than 
April 27, 2007) for removing and 
sending the affected blades to Rotor 
Blades, Inc. as specified by the 
manufacturer. We are including a long­
term requirement in this AD that the 
affected blades be replaced on or before 
April 27, 2007, as terminating action. 
Additionally, in AD 2004-24-08, we 
inadvertently omitted blade serial 
numbers 10102 through 10114 from the 
applicability. We are correcting that 
oversight with this action. 
Since issuing AD 2004-24-08, BHTC 
has issued Alert Service Bulletin 206-
04-100 for Bell Model 206A and B 
helicopters, and 2061-04-127 for Bell 
Model 2061 series helicopters, both 
Revision C, both dated March 5, 2005 
(ASB). These ASBs add two warnings in 
the compliance section specifying 
returning the blade for balancing to 
Rotor Blades, Inc., and introduce new 
skin damage limits that supersede the 
previous damage limits. The ASB also 
gives a new address for Rotor Blades 
Inc. 
Transport Canada, the airworthiness 
authority for Canada, notified the FAA 
that an unsafe condition may exist on 
these helicopter models. Transport 
Canada advises of three reports of skin 
cracks originating near the blade trailing edge balance weight. Two of the 
occurrences caused a loss of the weight 
and a strip of material along the trailing 
edge leading to an imbalance, which 
caused the fracture of three of the four 
tail rotor gearbox attachments. One of 
these occurrences resulted in the 
gearbox shifting that caused failure of 
the drive shaft and resulting loss of yaw 
control. Transport Canada issued AD 
No. CF-2004-05R1, dated June 28, 
2004, to ensure the continued 
airworthiness of these helicopters in 
Canada. 
These helicopter models are 
manufactured in Canada and are type 
certificated for operation in the United 
States under the provisions of 14 CFR 
21.29 and the applicable bilateral 
agreement. Pursuant to the applicable 
bilateral agreement, Transport Canada 
has kept the FAA informed of the 
situation described above. The FAA has 
examined the findings of Transport 
Canada, reviewed all available 
information, and determined that AD 
action is necessary for products of these 
type designs that are certificated for 
operation in the United States. 
Interested persons have been afforded 
an opportunity to participate in the 
making of this amendment. No 
comments were received on the 
proposal or the F AA's determination of 
the cost to the public. The FAA has 
determined that air safety and the 
public interest require the adoption of 
the rule as proposed, except for a 
change in paragraph (f) of the AD to add 
additional contact information. This 
change will neither increase the 
economic burden on any operator nor 
increase the scope of the AD. 
The FAA estimates that this AD will: 
• Affect 2194 helicopters of U.S. 
registry, 
• Take about ¼ work hour for a blade 
check or inspection, and 
• Take 3 work hours to replace a 
blade at an average labor rate of $65 per 
work hour. 
• Cost about $5848 per helicopter. (In 
its ASB, the manufacturer states it will 
give warranty credit based on hour 
usage on the blade with remaining life 
hours and other restrictions.) 
Based on these figures, we estimate 
the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. 
operators to be $19,989,973. Costs 
assume-200 pilot checks, 26 mechanic 
inspections, and one blade replacement 
for 90 percent of the fleet with a 
nonconforming blade. 
Regulatory Findings 
We have determined that this AD will 
not have federalism implications under 
Executive Order 13132. This AD will 
not have a substantial direct effect on
