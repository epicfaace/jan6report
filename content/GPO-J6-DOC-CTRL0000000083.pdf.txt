Good afternoon all, 
Apologies if you're OSINT shops are already tracking this one too -it does not meet our threshold for SARs but I wanted 
to share for your awareness as it pertains to some of your protectees and AO Rs. A citizen submitted the link through 
iWatch. 
An website called Red State Secession has posted an article requesting that users submit addresses of residences and 
offices of politicians, judges, and lobbyists. They are also asking for those individuals' routes to and from the event and 
have provided the secure email address secession@runbox.com for submissions. 
Please see the attached screenshot; the link to the article is www.redstatesecession .org/why-the-second-american ­
