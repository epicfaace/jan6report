1/6 warning 
Hi. I'm an internet expert of sorts who has been tracking online far right extremism for years. For weeks I've 
seen countless tweets from Trump supporters saying they will be armed on January 6th. Even when told of the 
gun laws, their response is "They can't stop all of us." Ive also seen tweets from people organizing to "storm the 
Capitol" on January 6th. 
Often these threats never amount to anything, but January 6th will be the day most of these people realize 
there's no chance left for Trump. They'll be pushed to what they feel is the edge. 
I'd be happy to collaborate or direct your attention to troublesome social media posts. 
I'm legit. My father is decorated colonel and a JAG lawyer who served two tours in Iraq. I think he may have 
some connections in DC if you don't end up getting back to me. 
To whoever is reading this email: Even if you decide not to respond, PLEASE be careful on January 6th. Many 
of these people will be carrying. I've been tracking online extremism for years and this is the first time I've 
been truly worried.
