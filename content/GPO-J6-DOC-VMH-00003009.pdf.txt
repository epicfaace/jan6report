John McEntee is the head of PPO. Been with potus from the start of2016 campaign. At his side almost all the time. Was with him this 
morning asking about Randy.

>>ME: 
>> Ok -a few things on Randy that I think are relevant to his counsel to President. First, Randy is totally loyal to the President. He is 
not looking for his next job. He's got plenty of money and is looking to retire. He has no polite society he is keen to return to intact that 
might affect his counsel. He grew up dirt poor in rural Georgia and is about as populist as they come. No need to worry that his 
counsel could down the road become infected with his own personal calculation. Second, he's an unusual attorney in that he thinks 
well outside the legal box. I don't know if you are aware that I too am an attorney by background . l haven't practiced for 20 years but I 
am very familiar with the typical legal mind. The normal legal mind is bound to options contained within the legal sphere. Not Randy. 
He understands we are in a much larger fight in which legal actions are only one subset. That's perhaps most important. He has a multi 
front 360 field of vision for waging this war.

>> For example, Wboever the lead lawyer advising the president right now MIGHT be bound to be advising him what is possible 
with legal recounts in the various states and how that affects getting to 270. If they arc bo\Illd to that standard, public language is also 
bounded by those legal standards. It becomes only a legal fight, not a political one. Randy will be advising the president that the 
currently contested election can be explained and prosecuted in much larger context and across fronts.

>>John: 
>> Sounds like Randy is the right man for the job

>>Me: 
>> I think I mentioned but keep in mind that Randy was Newt's political lawyer during his speakership. He helped Newt weather the 
Dem onslaught against newt on 88 bullshit ethics charges that threatened to drive him from office. He also was Speaker Hastert's 
political lawyer during his entire speakership, including through the 2000 Florida recount and gaming out how George W Bush would 
win the presidency if the election were decided by the House. In short, Randy is a wartime consigliere who thinks the election is 
being stolen from the President. Also, he knows the situation in Georgia very ve1y well. He knows how they pad the vote totals there.
