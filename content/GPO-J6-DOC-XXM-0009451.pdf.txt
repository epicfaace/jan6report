Please DO NOT respond to the previous chain. I wrote down Derek's email incorrectly. It is 
correct on this chain. I sincerely apologize. 
All-
Attached is the PA death data. The QC process took the potential dead voters from around 130 down to 
these 15 confirmed. The data we have access to from RNC goes up to 11/5 and thus is comprehensive 
for ab/ev; however, available data does not include in-person voting which represents approximatelyÂ½ 
of the total number of votes cast in PA. We would need a court order or something similar to obtain the 
in-person results. 
I note that this is a conservative view of the results: If there was any real question about whether the 
team had the correct person, we tossed the result. If we spent substantially more time researching each 
potential dead voter and manually confirming we could possibly confirm up to an absolute maximum of 
20 more, but my view is the team needs to move on to GA. GA will take a lot of effort to confirm as GA 
does not include full dates of birth in its voter file. GA starts with 108 possible dead voters, which likely 
will be significantly decreased following QC. 
Note that rows highlighted in red indicate voters who were registered to vote AFTER the date of death.
