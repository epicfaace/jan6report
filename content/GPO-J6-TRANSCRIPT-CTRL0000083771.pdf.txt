INVESTIGATIVE COUNSEL 2  3 
1 
2 Good morning. It is May 19th, 2022. And this 
3 is the deposition of Mr. Dion Cini, conducted by the House Select 
4 Committee to investigate the January 6th attack on the United 
5 States Capitol pursuant to House Resolution 503. 
6 This will be a staff led deposition. The members may choose 
7 to ask questions, and at this time, I'd ask the witness to please 
8 state your full name and spell your last name for the record. 
9 
10 
11 
12 Sure. My name is Dion Cini, C-I-N-I. 
but my name 
the Select Committee. And I introduce myself previously, 
I'm the investigative counsel with 
There is no other staff on the call right 
13 now and also there are other members on the call. 
14 Under House deposition rules, Neither committee members nor 
15 staff may discuss the substance of the testimony --of your 
16 testimony today unless the committee approves release. 
17 And then I'll also note that under House rules, you may have 
18 an attorney present, but counsel for other individuals or 
19 attorneys from other government agencies may not be, and 
20 therefore not present today. I'll just note for the record that 
21 you're not represented by counsel today, but you are aware that 
22 you have that option. 
23 And then also what has previously been marked as Exhibit 
24 1 is the Select Committee's March 23, 2022 subpoena for Mr. Dion 
25 Cini and the House deposition rules were included in that  4 
1 subpoena as an exhibit. 
2 As I mentioned just before we got on the record, there's 
3 an official reporter that's going to be transcribing the 
4 deposition today and everything that we said. 
5 So just to make our job a little bit easier, if you can try 
6 to wait until I finished my question before you start your answer. 
7 It's very difficult for the reporter to transcribe two people 
8 speaking at the same time. 
9 And then sort of along those same lines, we can only 
10 transcribe verbal responses. So just make sure that you use a 
11 verbal response instead of something like a head shake. I know 
12 we all do that in conversation sometimes, so I'll just remind 
13 you, if I see you shake your head just to ask you to give a verbal 
14 response. 
15 Does that all make sense? 
16 
17 The Witness. Yes, it does. 
Okay. And then today all that I'm asking you 
18 to do is provide complete answers to the best of your 
19 recollection. 
20 So if a question is not clear or you don't know the answer, 
21 feel free to just ask for a clarification or just tell me, I don't 
22 know. That'll probably happen today, and that's absolutely 
23 fine. 
24 You're obligated to answer all of my questions unless you 
25 are going to assert a privilege recognized by the committee  5 
1 privilege such as the Fifth Amendment privilege against 
2 compulsory self-incrimination. 
3 If you do choose to assert any sort of privilege like that, 
4 we can either pause the deposition and seek a ruling from the 
5 chairman on that privilege assertion, or we'll just note the 
6 assertion and then continue on. 
7 And then this is --sorry. Lots of housekeeping rules to 
8 go over before I get started. And feel free to slow me down or 
9 tell me to stop it if you have any questions. 
10 But I also need to provide you a warning that we provide 
11 to every witness that we talked to, which is that it's unlawful 
12 to deliberately provide false information to Congress. So 
13 providing false information during this deposition could result 
14 in criminal penalties for perjury or providing false statements. 
15 Does that make sense to you? 
16 The Witness. Yes, it does. 
17 Okay. Now, with that being said, I do want to 
18 be clear that this is a congressional investigation and not a 
19 c r i mi n al i n vest i g at i on . 
20 We are not involved in any work that the DOJ or FBI is doing. 
21 We are not partners in their investigation. They're not 
22 partners of ours. 
23 And so I just want to make sure that you understand that 
24 distinction. 
25 The Witness. Yes, sir.  6 
1 And then let me know at any point if you need 
2 to take a break. I normally try to remember to take about a 
3 five-minute break every hour or so, and I don't expect that we'll 
4 go much over two hours. 
s So we'll probably take a break in there, And then if you 
6 need a break at any other time, feel free to say so. 
7 And then, as I noted before we go on the Record, I'll be 
8 asking most of the questions. There might be a time that another 
9 staff member pops on the call or a member of the committee to 
10 ask you some questions. And I'll try to make sure to alert you 
11 that somebody else has joined the call if that happens. 
12 And then lastly, because this is a deposition, you'll be 
13 under oath. And so I'll just ask you to raise your right hand 
14 to be sworn. 
15 The Rep o rte r . Do you solemnly s we a r and a ff i rm u n de r the 
16 penalty of perjury that the testimony you are about to give will 
17 be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? 
18 The Witness. I do. 
19 The Reporter. Thank you.  7 
EXAMINATION 
BY 1 
2 
3 
4 Q All those ground rules are out of the way, So we can start 
5 with some simple stuff. If you could just tell me or describe 
6 your kind of educational and professional background, that would 
7 be helpful. 
8 A Can I start with a statement? 
9 Q Sure. Yeah. If you have a statement that you'd like 
10 to make, go for it. 
11 A Sure. It is my pleasure to be here today with the Select 
12 Committee. I have provided what I believe is the only single 
13 document and recording that I could assist with The Select 
14 Committee's investigation that I could locate, as per the vague 
15 guidelines regarding documents and communications of 
16 constitutionally protected political activity for information 
17 outside of my custody. It's very well documented with a simple 
18 Google search that I am and al ways have been a peaceful and lawful 
19 demonstrator. 
20 I have what many call a loner. And while some people 
21 believe that I may be part of fringe political organizations and 
22 not. The leaders and followers of said fringe political 
23 organizations have more of a fascination with me than I do of 
24 them. 
25 It's always been my belief that when you walk alone, you're  8 
1 only responsible for yourself and not of others. 
2 With that said, I respectfully invoke my rights under the 
3 Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution on the grounds that 
4 answering questions may incriminate me. 
5 Q Mr. Cini, Just to let you know, the way that we do this 
6 is when somebody chooses to invoke the Fifth Amendment, you have 
7 to do that as to each question that I ask you? 
8 So we're still we're still going to go through the 
9 deposition. I'm still going to ask you a series of questions, 
10 and then you'll need to think about the question and what your 
11 response would be and decide if the response to that question 
12 would potentially or could potentially be used against you in 
13 a criminal prosecution. Then you can invoke that Fifth 
14 Amendment right, but you should listen to the question and then 
15 think about the implications of raising the Fifth Amendment 
16 before you do that. 
17 Does that make sense to you? 
18 
19 A 
Q Yes, sir. 
Okay. So again, I'll just ask you if you could tell me 
20 a little bit about your educational and professional background? 
21 A I respectfully invoke my rights under the Fifth 
22 Amendment of the U.S. Constitution on the grounds that answering 
23 questions may incriminate me. 
24 Q Ok a y . Ag a i n , I j us t want to ask , i s i t your be l i e f that 
25 telling me about your educational background could be used  9 
1 against you in a criminal case. And that is that that is evidence 
2 of Having committed a crime? 
3 A No. 
4 Q Okay. So, you know, I understand that there might be 
5 some questions that I ask you that might raise those concerns 
6 for you. But I'd encourage you if your answer is no to that 
7 question that I just asked you, that you don't believe that your 
8 educational background is going to be incriminating, then we 
9 cover some of those basic questions. And then when I raise kind 
10 of more specific questions that do concern you, then you can 
11 assert your Fifth Amendment right? 
12 If you continue to want to assert your Fifth Amendment right 
13 to that question, that's your right to do so. But I will let 
14 you know that there potentially later could be a challenge to 
15 that assertion. The chairman might overrule the assertion, or 
16 we might have to call you back and read conduct a deposition once 
17 a ruling has been made on your assertion of that right. 
18 Does that all make sense? 
19 
20 A 
Q Yes, sir. 
Okay. So I'll just ask you one more time. Can you kind 
21 of give me a run through of your educational and professional 
22 background? 
23 A High school education. And I guess you could say I'm 
24 self-educated in technology, software and network 
25 infrastructure.  10 
1 Q Okay. And how about professionally? What do you do as 
2 your primary source of income? 
3 A Right now, I guess you could say, I'm out of 
4 work semi --out of work at the moment. 
5 Q What did you do when you were employed? 
6 A Sales. 
7 
8 
9 Q Okay. And do you have any sources of income right now? 
A Very little. 
Q Where are those Little --where are those sources of 
10 income? 
11 
12 A 
Q Manufacturing Toys, Small toys. 
Yeah. Okay. And am I right that you run or have in the 
13 past run a business selling Trump-related paraphernalia like 
14 flags and that sort of thing?

11 quickly. 
12 
13

Yeah. 
So you and I have talked a little bit previously, and 
your statement, you said that you, I think, are not  12 
1 associated with --you didn't name any organizations, But is it 
2 right that you are not a member of the Proud Boys? 
3 A I respectfully invoke my rights under the Fifth 
4 Amendment of the U . S . Const i tut i on on the grounds that ans we r i n g 
5 questions may incriminate crime. 
6 Q Okay. And you --feel free, Instead of saying that 
7 whole statement, you can just say the Fifth or plead the Fifth. 
8 Just to make things a little bit more efficient time-wise? 
9 
10 
11 
12 A Okay. 
Q Are you familiar with the Proud Boys organization? 
A I plead the Fifth. 
Q Could you characterize your current relationship with 
13 the Proud Boys or members of the Proud Boys?

22 correct, these messages with Mr. Torrio on Telegram?

24 A I plead the Fifth. 
Q And in these messages you are discussing with him an 
25 incident that occurred at a church where some property was  14

2 everybody that show me one picture, one video of a Proud Boy 
3 destroying property and I won't be in the club," end quote? 
4 Is that a message that you sent? 
5 
6 A I plead the Fifth. 
Q And I just want to ask you about the specific phrase "I 
7 won't be in the club." When I read that, that implies to me that 
8 you are currently in the club and that you would no longer be 
9 if you saw property destroyed; Is that correct?

5 you able to see that? 
6 A Yes. 
7 Q And these are messages. It appears they were sent on 
8 February 24th. Again, these look like telegram messages with 
9 Mr. Enrique Torrio, as you had previously represented in emails 
10 to me? 
11 And I want to draw your attention to the first two messages. 
12 And I'm just going to read for the record what you stated in these 
13 messages to Mr. Torrio. 
14 You said, "I'm not your enemy. I just don't like your 
15 l ea de r s h i p s t y l e . You h ad ton s of opp o r t u n i t i e s to t u r n t he PB s 
16 a round and you never taken it." 
17 And then the second message sent at 10:44 a.m. on February 
18 24th, 2021, says, "And then when you finally speak up, you say, 
19 PBs shouldn't have gone in after you say you're going to go in. 
20 Not right at all. That certainly doesn't help their case." 
21 I wanted to ask you, when did Mr. Torrio tell you that he 
22 was going to go in? 
23 A I p l ea d t he F i f t h .
