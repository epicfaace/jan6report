Subject: Legal memo

[External Message] 
John -what would you think of producing a legal memo outlining the constitutional role of state legislators in designating electors? Rather than 
governors, the US Constitution vests that responsibility with state legislators. Where state exec branch officials have rewritten or ignored state election 
law, why couldn't legislatures reclaim that constitutional duly, and designate the electors -rather than delegating to governors. The US statute may be 
unconstitutional as the Gov has no authority under the Constitution to designate electors. Am I crazy? Dick Morris called me about this. I said a legal 
memo would be required and you would be the person to write ii. And maybe get others to sign ii. 
What about that? A movement is stirring. But needs constitutional support. 
Would you be willing to discuss ii with Dick Morris? What about that?
