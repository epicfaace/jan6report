Chiefs, 
Attached is the updated intelligence assessment for the Joint Session. The assessment is current as of 1500 hours today. 
We'll be setting a conference call again for tomorrow afternoon for our Jack and Julie to go over the updates with 
Commanders, similar to the one we held on 12/30. We'll be pushing this out to all officials from our IICD email tomorrow 
morning. Board reps have been updated. Any questions, don't hesitate to reach out.
