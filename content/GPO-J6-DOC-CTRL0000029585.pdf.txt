This "government" is now unjust. And 
it does NOT derive its power from the 
consent of the governed. It gets its 
UNJUST power from stealing elections 
and making a mockery of our consent. 
And there is no liberty, no commerce 
(unless you are among the favored 
elite, or a massive corporation), no 
redress or grievances.

The militia is what is missing. Sure, on

not on the ground. Not in "meat

That's what we need to fix. 
In your town: 
Who's on your buddy team? 
Who's on your fire team? 
Who's in your squad? 
Who's in your "home guard" "family 
safe" armed neighborhood watch? 
Who's in your town militia? 
Who's in your county militia? 
Who is on your state-wide QRF? Men 
who WILL answer the call and roll out 
when you need them, in your state? 
And then who is in your regional QRF? 
And at every level, of course, ask Who 
are your allies from other groups who 
you can rely on?

there to stop them or to at least make 
their lives hell while they try to extract. 
Think back to the Founders .
