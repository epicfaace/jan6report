Hi Matt and Nick, 
The states have had a day to process what we are asking of the presidential electors in the 
litigation states, and it seems like a lot of questions are arising. The main issues that we need 
to address so far seem to be as follows: 
Process 
The process for voting is very basic, but states seem to want to skip steps. Therefore, I think we 
should send each state a packet with the following: 
-Copies of the Certificate of Vote. 
-Instructions on where and when they have to meet, if the time and location are specified in 
state law. 
-Instructions for how many copies of the certificate to print, and where to send all of the 
copies. 
-Direction to mail the certificates ASAP. They must arrive within nine days of signing. 
Replacement Electors 
JB says that 1/3 to 1/4 of the electors may not appear on Monday, and Chairman Ta bas has 
already left the state. Kelli Ward has someone in Arizona that is traveling as well and may not 
make it back. State law governs the replacement of electors, and legal replacement usually 
requires some legal action from the Governor or SOS. We are not likely to get that action, so 
we need to determine how we want to proceed with replacements. 
Comms 
How do we want to handle com ms for voting, and there are a lot of issues around this? In 
Arizona, state legislators want to be at the vote and prepare a letter of support. In 
Pennsylvania, it seems that many electors are against this, so we may not want anyone talking 
to the press. There is some concern about general media criticism in other states. At 
minimum, I think we need to address the following: 
XXM-0016071  -Voting must take place at the capitol under most state laws. Do we want to make this an 
official event, even if it is not public (reserve a room, put invitations in writing, etc.? 
-Do we want to make it public in any way? We could invite some combination of the public, 
elected officials, and the press. 
-Do we want to do any com ms on this? Most states are keeping quiet so far, but my guess is 
that at least PA will get out at any time. 
State Calls 
JB has requested a call with the PA electors and/or leadership to address concerns, and Clayton 
has requested a call with the WI electors just to get everyone on the same page. Clayton's call 
is not expected to be problematic, and JB's call may be necessary to get people to appear. Do 
we want to try to do this with any other states? 
Thanks, 
Josh
