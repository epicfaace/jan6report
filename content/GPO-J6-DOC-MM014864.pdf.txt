On January 6, 2021, Vice President Mike Pence, as President of the Senate, should call 
out all electoral votes that he believes are unconstitutional as no electoral votes at 
all --in accordance with guidance from founding father Alexander Hamilton and judicial 
precedence. 
"No legislative act," wrote Alexander Hamilton in Federalist No. 78, "contrary to the 
Constitution, can be valid." The court in Hubbard v. Lowe 
reinforced this truth: "That an unconstitutional statute is not a law at all is a 
proposition no longer open to discussion." 226 F. 135, 137 (SDNY 1915), appeal 
dismissed, 242 U.S. 654 (1916). 
Following this rationale, an unconstitutionally appointed elector, like an 
unconstitutionally enacted statute, is no elector at all.
