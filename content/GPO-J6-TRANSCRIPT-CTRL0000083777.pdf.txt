Why don't we go on the record at 1:56 p.m. 1

3 Good afternoon. This is a deposition of Antonio LaMotta 
4 conducted by the House Select Committee to Investigate the 
5 January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol pursuant to House 
6 Resolution 503. 
7 Mr. LaMotta, please state your full name and spell your last 
8 name for the record. 
9 The Witness. My name is Antonio P. LaMotta. My last 
10 name's spelled capital L-a, capital M-o-t-t-a. 
11 Thank you very much. And Mr. LaMotta, would 
12 you please raise your right hand to be sworn in by the court 
13 reporter. 
14 The Witness. Yes, sir. 
15 The Rep o rte r . Do you solemnly de cl a re and a ff i rm u n de r the 
16 penalty of perjury that the testimony you are about to give will 
17 be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? 
18 The Witness. I do. 
19 
20 Thank you very much. 
Mr. LaMotta, this will be a staff-led deposition. My name 
21 is I'm an investigative counsel. If members join, 
22 they might ask any questions, too, but I don't see any on the 
23 Webex with us right now. 
24 So for this deposition, we will fol low the House deposition 
25 rules that we provided to your counsel previously, and under  4 
1 those rules, you are permitted to have an attorney present. And 
2 at this time, I'd ask that your counsel please state her name 
3 for the record and to spell her last name. 
4 Ms. Wimmer. Good afternoon. Lauren Wimmer for 
5 Mr. LaMotta. W-i-m-m-e-r. 
6 Thank you very much. 
7 Under the House deposition rules, neither committee members 
8 nor staff may discuss the substance of testimony that you provide 
9 today unless the committee approves release. You and your 
10 attorney will have an opportunity to review the transcript. And 
11 before we begin, Mr. LaMotta, I'd like to describe a few ground 
12 rules. 
13 So there is an official reporter transcribing the record 
14 of this deposition. The reporter's also joining us by Webex. 
15 So just please wait until each question is completed before you 
16 begin your response, and I'll try to wait until your response 
17 is complete before we ask our next question. 
18 The reporter cannot record nonverbal responses such as 
19 shaking your head. So it is important that you answer each 
20 question with an audible, verbal response. For the benefit of 
21 the reporter and the record, there may be times where I spell 
22 a name or word that we are using, or that we ask that you do the 
23 same. 
24 And I ask that you provide complete answers based on your 
25 best recollection. If the question is not clear, which might  5 
1 happen, please ask for clarification. And if you do not know 
2 the answer to a question, please simply say so. 
3 Logistically, if you need any breaks for comfort or to 
4 discuss something with Ms. Wimmer, just let me know. We' re happy 
5 to accommodate. 
6 And throughout the deposition, I will be directing your 
7 attention to some exhibits, which are going to get displayed on 
8 the screen. And when I refer you to a document, you can take 
9 your time to familiarize yourself with it before we discuss it. 
10 So under the House deposition rules, you may only refuse 
11 to answer a question to preserve a privilege recognized by the 
12 select committee. If you refuse to answer a question based on 
13 a privilege, I might either proceed with the deposition or seek 
14 a ruling from the chairman on the objection. 
15 If the chairman overrules such an objection, you are 
16 required to answer the question. 
17 So, Mr. LaMotta, my goal today is to ask questions relevant 
18 to the select committee's investigation with the hope that you 
19 will answer. If you have an objection or a privilege assertion, 
20 you know, I'll ask that you assert it for the record. 
21 And I understand from Ms. Wimmer that you may invoke the 
22 Fifth Amendment in response to some of my questions today. And 
23 since I'm aware of this objection, I will say that the goal of 
24 the select committee is really to just understand the basis for 
25 your objection so that we can fairly evaluate it.  6 
1 And, ultimately, the more detail you can provide about the 
2 basis for the objection, you know, the easier it will be for the 
3 select committee to consider the objection. 
4 At this time, I'd ask Ms. Wimmer to please place on the 
5 record any general objections she might have or to make any 
6 opening remarks. 
7 Ms. Wimmer. Thank you, yes. Mr. LaMotta currently has an 
8 open pending matter in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas 
9 relevant to actions that occurred at the time of the election. 
10 There was subsequently a motion to revoke bail, and I believe 
11 that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, through the District 
12 Attorney's office, has filed some motions regarding alleged 
13 contact of or conduct of Mr. LaMotta, especially as it pertains 
14 to either the codefendant in his case, whose name is Joshua 
15 Macias, and any sort of subsequent acts or involvements in any 
16 sort of groups or events regarding the election, or events 
17 regarding President Trump. 
18 And so, since there is an active criminal case that has not 
19 been resolved, Mr. LaMotta will be invoking his Fifth Amendment 
20 right to remain silent predominantly with any questions that are 
21 asked regarding President Trump, Mr. Macias, cell phone, social 
22 media, and any sort of questions regarding his alleged presence 
23 at the t i me , o r i n Wash i n gt on , D . C . at the t i me of the attack 
24 on January 6th. 
25 Thank you very much, Ms. Wimmer, for the  7 
1 context. I appreciate it. 
2 
3 Mr. LaMotta, I also want to remind you --and we do this 
for all witnesses that it is unlawful to deliberately provide 
4 false information to Congress. Since this deposition is under 
5 oath, providing false information could result in criminal 
6 penalties to include for perjury and/or providing false 
7 statements. Do you understand? 
8 The Witness. Yes, sir. 
9 Thank you very much. So we can get into the 
10 substantive questions. I am going to share --
11 Ms. Wimmer. Sorry. Mr. LaMotta, as I told you before we 
12 started, because I know we're not sitting in the same room and 
13 I do have al ittle bit of a lag on my computer, the joys of WiFi. 
14 So if there is something that is unclear, you are able to consult 
15 w i th me . So rat he r than you p r o vi d i n g an ans we r that you ' re not 
16 sure of, or if you have questions, please just immediately let 
17 us know so that way you and I can consult so things remain smooth, 
18 okay? 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 The Witness. Okay. That's clear. Thank you. 
Great. 
EXAMINATION 
BY 
Q So I'm going to share exhibit 1. We can do al ittle test 
24 of the screen. 
25 M r . L a Mo t t a , c a n you see ex h i b i t 1 on you r s c re en ?  8 
A Yes, I can. 1 
2 Q And do you recognize this as the subpoena that the select 
3 committee issued to you? 
4 A Yes, it is. 
5 Q Great. Thank you. And you do understand that you are 
6 appearing here today pursuant to this subpoena, correct? 
7 
8 A Correct. 
Q Thank you. So Mr. LaMotta, are you aware of an 
9 organization that was known as Vets for Trump that operated 
10 between November 2020 and January 2021? 
11 
12 A 
Q Yes, I am. 
Do you know if Joshua Macias was the founder of that 
13 organization? 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 A I do. 
Q Okay. And how do you know Mr. Macias? 
A Through a friend. Through a friend, retired FBI. 
Q I'm sorry. The friend was a retired FBI? 
A Yeah. 
Q And why did he introduce you to Mr. Macias? 
A He was doing for security. That's it. 
Q And did you work security for Vets for Trump? 
A For Macias. 
Q Okay. So you did security for Mr. Macias? 
A Yes, sir. 
Q And that's how you became acquaintances?  1 
2 A Yes, sir. 
Q Would you say that you had, like, a personal 9 
3 relationship with Mr. Macias outside of that work relationship? 
4 Ms. Wimmer. Mr. LaMotta, you can invoke your Fifth with 
5 regard to questions regarding Mr. Macias. 
6 The Witness. Yeah. I would invoke the Fifth Amendment to 
7 that. 
8 BY 
9 Q Okay. So I just want to make sure I understand your 
10 reasoning for invoking the Fifth, Mr. LaMotta. 
11 So the Fifth Amendment --when you invoke the Fifth 
12 Amendment means that you have a good-faith belief that you were 
13 forced to tell the truth in responding to the question, you could 
14 be test i f y i n g i n a man n e r that you be l i eve could be used a g a i n st 
15 you i n a c r i mi n al p rose cut i on . Do you u n de rs tan d? 
16 
17 A Right. Right. 
Q And do you still wish to invoke the Fifth Amendment to 
18 t h a t q u e s t i on ? 
19 A Yes. Has nothing to do with the subject matter here. 
20 Q Understood. Thank you. 
21 And aside from providing security for Mr. Macias, did you 
22 have an official role with the Vets For Trump Organization? 
23 
24 A 
Q No, sir. 
Okay. Are you aware of whether Vets for Trump worked 
25 with Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, or any Three Percenter  10 
1 organizations? 
A No, sir. 2 
3 Q And do you yourself align with any of those groups that 
4 I just mentioned? 
5 A No, sir. 
6 Q How about any militia organizations? 
7 A No, sir. 
8 Q Appreciate it. Thank you. 
9 Moving on to the November 2020 election. After the 
10 election, did you believe that the election was stolen? 
11 Ms. Wimmer. Mr. LaMotta, you need to invoke your Fifth 
12 Amendment right to remain silent as this pertains directly to 
13 the allegations in Philadelphia. 
14 
15 
16 The Witness. I invoke the Fifth Amendment. 
BY 
Q Okay. And again, invoking the Fifth Amendment means 
17 that you have reasonable belief that answering the question 
18 could --so r r y --i f you we re f o r c e d to tel l the t rut h , you could 
19 be test i f y i n g i n a manner that you be l i eve d could be used a g a i n st 
20 you in a criminal prosecution. Do you understand that, Mr. 
21 LaMotta? 
22 A Yes , s i r . 
23 Q Thank you. So did you work with any organizations that 
24 labeled themselves "stop the steal" following the November 2020 
25 e l e c t i on ?  11 
1 A No, sir. 
2 Q And did you attend any rallies outside of the 
3 January 6th rally that protested the results of the 2020 
4 election? 
A No, sir. 5 
6 Q And why did you think that the election was stolen from 
7 Mr. Trump? 
8 Ms. Wimmer. Mr. LaMotta, you need to invoke your Fifth 
9 Amendment right to remain silent. 
10 The Witness. I would --I would like to invoke my Fifth 
11 Amendment to that question. 
12 BY 
13 Q Okay. Were you paying attention to President Trump's 
14 social media about the 2020 election? Did that influence your 
15 view? 
16 
17 A No, sir. 
Q What were you reading then that gave you the impression 
18 that the 2020 election was stolen. 
19 Ms. Wimmer. , I think that is an incorrect 
20 representation of Mr. LaMotta's testimony at this point. And 
21 Mr. LaMotta, I would, again, remind you that you need to invoke 
22 your Fifth based on the current pending criminal charges. 
23 The W i t n es s . I i n v o k e the F i ft h Amendment to the quest i on . 
24 You're correct, Ms. Wimmer. I apologize for 
25 mischaracterizing his testimony.  12 
1 BY 
2 Q So Mr. LaMotta, is it your intention then to invoke the 
3 Fifth to any questions related to your beliefs about the 2020 
4 election? 
5 
6 
7 
8 Ms. Wimmer. Yes. 
The Witness. Yes. 
BY 
Q Thank you. Mr. LaMotta, did you attend a rally in 
9 Washington, D.C. on December 12th, 2020? 
10 A I was there. I didn't attend the rally. I was there 
11 as security for Macias. 
12 Q Okay. So did Mr. Macias ask you to attend with him? 
13 A I was asked to protect, give him personal protection. 
14 That's what I did. 
15 Q Do you know why Mr. Macias asked for personal 
16 protection? 
17 A Yes. 
18 Q And what was the reason that M r . Mac i as needed p e rs on al 
19 protection? 
20 A Wherever we go, he needs protection. We spoke about 
21 that before I agreed. So whatever he does, it's kind of 
22 dangerous . You have all k i n d s of pol i ti cal people there . So 
23 Q Did Mr. Macias ever tell you who he thought the threat 
24 was? 
25 Ms. Wimmer. Mr. LaMotta, you don't have to answer any  13 
1 questions --Mr. LaMotta, you do not need to answer any questions 
2 regarding conversations between you and an existing codefendant, 
3 Mr. Macias. 
4 
5 
6 The Witness. Okay. I invoke the Fifth Amendment. 
BY 
Q So, again, just for the record, Mr. LaMotta, by invoking 
7 the Fifth Amendment, it means that you have a good-faith belief 
8 that if you were forced to tell the truth, you would be testifying 
9 in a manner that you believe could be used against you in a 
10 criminal prosecution. Do you understand that? 
11 A Yes, s i r. 
12 Q Thank you. Did Mr. Macias ask you to provide security 
13 for anybody else on December 12th, 2020? 
14 A No, sir. 
15 Q Ok a y . Do you know i f M r . Mac i as was pl an n i n g to meet 
16 up with any groups, any other groups on December 12th, 2020? 
17 A No, sir. 
18 Q Was M r . Mac i as h i ms el f p r o vi d i n g sec u r i t y f o r somebody 
19 at the December 12th? 
20 
21 A 
Q No, sir. 
Okay. You said that you didn't attend the rally, but 
22 were you with Mr. Macias the whole day on December 12th, 2020. 
23 Ms. Wimmer. Mr. LaMotta, you do not need to answer that 
24 question. 
25 The W i t n es s . I i n v o k e the F i ft h Amendment to the quest i on .  14 
1 BY 
2 Q Thank you. Do you know if Mr. Macias met up with General 
3 Flynn on December 12th, 2020? 
4 Ms. Wimmer. Mr. LaMotta, you don't have to answer any 
5 questions of which you are unaware or any questions regarding 
6 Mr. Macias and his actions as it relates to that date as it was 
7 the subject of motions filed by the Philadelphia District 
8 Attorney's office. 
9 
10 The Witness. I invoke the Fifth Amendment. 
BY 
11 Q Thank you. Did you meet up with General Flynn on 
12 December 12th, 2020? 
13 A No, sir. 
14 
15 
16 
17 Ms. Wimmer. Same response, Mr. LaMotta. 
The Witness. I invoke the Fifth Amendment. 
BY 
Q Thank you very much. Did you meet up with any groups 
18 such as the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, or Three Percenter groups 
19 on December 12th, 2020? 
20 
21 Ms. Wimmer. Same response, Mr. LaMotta. 
The Witness. Same response. I invoke the Fifth 
22 Amendment. 
23 BY 
24 Q Understood. Thank you. And Mr. LaMotta, did you 
25 happen to run into Alex Jones on December 12th, 2020?  1 
2 
3 
4 Ms. Wimmer. Same response, Mr. LaMotta. 
The Witness. I invoke the Fifth Amendment. 
BY 
Q Thank you. Mr. LaMotta, I'm going to show you an 
5 exhibit, assuming I can do this appropriately. My computer 
6 froze, I apologize. 
7 A Okay. 
8 Q Can you see the exhibit, Mr. LaMotta? 
9 
10 A 
Q I can see the title page, yes. 
Yes. So this is a chat --a group chat titled, 15 
11 "December 12th D.C. security/leadership," and you see it starts 
12 on December 10th, 2020. Fortunately, the names of a lot of 
13 people are redacted, but Alice Butler Short seems to be adding 
14 people to this group. 
15 Were you a member of this group chat, Mr. LaMotta? 
16 
17 
18 
19 Ms. Wimmer. Same answer, Mr. LaMotta. 
The Witness. I invoke the Fifth Amendment. 
BY 
Q Okay. Thank you very much, Mr. LaMotta. 
20 So is it your intention then to invoke the Fifth Amendment 
21 for all questions related to the December 12th rally in 
22 Washington, D.C.? 
23 
24 A 
Q Yes. 
Okay. Well, the select committee would like to ask you 
25 questions about the December 12th rally, including your  16 
1 interactions with some of the individuals who attended the rally, 
2 such as Mr. Macias, Mr. Flynn, Mr. Jones, Mr. Stewart Rhodes, 
3 and others, and to ask you about whether you witnessed any 
4 violence or any other conversations about organizing future 
5 rallies on that day. 
6 So I appreciate the fact that you are intending to invoke 
7 the Fifth for all of those questions, though. Thank you. 
8 So moving on to January 6th and January 5th rallies. Mr. 
9 LaMotta, when did you become aware that there was going to be 
10 a series of rallies on January 5th and January 6th in Washington, 
11 D. C.? 
12 Ms. Wimmer. Mr. LaMotta, you can invoke the Fifth, again, 
13 as it pertains to any questions regarding this rally and any 
14 knowledge that you purported or allegedly have. 
15 
16 
17 The Witness. I invoke the Fifth. 
BY 
Q Did you see a tweet by President Trump on December 19th 
18 where he told people to come to Washington, D. C. for a rally that 
19 would be "wild," quote/unquote? 
20 A I invoke the Fifth. 
21 Q Okay. Did you attend any rallies in Washington, D.C.

9 LaMotta? 
10 
11 A I invoke the Fifth. 
Q And, again, for the record, invoking the Fifth Amendment 
12 means that you have a good-faith belief that if you were forced 
13 to tell the truth, you would be testifying in a manner that you 
14 believed could be used against you in a criminal prosecution. 
15 Do you u n de rs tan d that , M r . La Mott a?

23 that participated in the storming of the Capitol and violence 
24 on January 6th, and we'd like to ask you about what you heard 
25 and what you saw.  21

6 A I invoke the Fifth Amendment, sir. 
7 Q Okay. And just for the record, invoking the Fifth 
8 Amendment means that you have a good-faith belief that if you

11 prosecution.

3 Q Mr. LaMotta, was that you pictured next to Mr. Macias 
4 while he was giving a speech outside of the Capitol on 
5 January 6th? 
6 A I invoke the Fifth Amendment, sir. 
7 Q Thank you, Mr. LaMotta. 
8 And I'll represent to you that for technical reasons, I 
9 could not hear exactly what Mr. Macias was saying there. I've 
10 listened to the whole speech a number of times. So I know that 
11 in those 2 minutes, he calls Vice President Pence a Benedict 
12 Arnold.

14 Benedict Arnold? 
15

Q Mr. LaMotta, I would've liked to ask you questions about 
3 who you interacted with on January 6th, what you saw, and 
4 particularly, whether you interacted with individuals who have 
5 interest in the select committee such as Proud Boys, Oath 
6 Keepers, Three Percenters, Vets for Trump, and other 
7 organizations that we believe had a role in organizing or 
8 participating in rallies, and possibly violence on January 6th. 
9 And is it my understanding that you intend to invoke the 
10 Fifth Amendment to refuse to answer questions on any of those 
11 topics or any other topics related to January 6th? 
12 
13 A Yes, sir. 
Thank you very much. Mr. LaMotta, I'm just 
14 checking. That is all the questions I have for you, Mr. LaMotta. 
15 Ms. Wimmer, do you have anything you'd like to add before 
16 we go off the record? 
17 Ms. Wimmer. No, thank you. 
18 Actually, before we go off the record, give me 
19 one second. I apologize. So because Mr. LaMot ta has asserted 
20 the Fifth Amendment as a basis to refuse to answer most of my 
21 questions today, under these circumstances, we will not close 
22 the record on the deposition because the select committee has 
23 to determine the appropriate course of action moving forward on 
24 those objections. 
25 Therefore, we will adjourn --the deposition will stand in  26 
1 recess subject to the call of the chair. 
2 And we're off the record at 2:28 p.m. 
3 [Whereupon, at 2:28 p.m., the deposition was recessed, 
4 subject to the call of the Chair.]  1
