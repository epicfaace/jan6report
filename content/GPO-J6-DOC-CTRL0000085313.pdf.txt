Dear Mr. President, 
Please see below a draft statement as you requested. Judicial Watch is concerned about the planned unlawful effort to 
overturn the results of the election and shares this with you as part of our educational mission. 
Thank you, 
Tom Fitton 
Judicial Watch 
The voters have spoken. The ballots counted by the Election Day deadline show the American people have bestowed on 
me the great honor of reelection to President of the United States. Federal law establishes November 3 as Election Day -
the deadline by which voters in states across the country must choose a president. Some partisans will try to overturn 
today's lawful election results by shamelessly counting ballots that arrive after Election Day for days and weeks. This is 
lawless, invites massive voter fraud, undermines our democracy, and could dishonestly cancel the votes of tens of 
millions of Americans who ensured their votes would arrive to be counted on Election Day. I am prepared to go to court 
to make sure this election is not stolen and am directing the Justice Department to defend federal election law 
accordingly. We had an election today -and I won. Some believe Election Day deadlines don't matter and would attack 
democracy through fraud and judicial activism. Counting ballots that arrive after Election Day is unfair and shows 
contempt for the will of the people. I will defend, to the full extent of the law, free and fair elections and our 
constitutional republic from any electoral coup. Thank you and God bless America.
