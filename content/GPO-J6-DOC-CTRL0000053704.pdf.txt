Antrim Michigan Forensics Report 
REVISED PRELIMINARY SUMMARY, v2 
Report Date 12/13/2020 
Client: Bill Bailey 
Attorney: Matthew DePerno 
A. WHOWEARE 
1. My name is Russell James Ramsland, Jr., and I am a resident of Dallas County, 
Texas. I hold an MBA from Harvard University, and a political science degree 
from Duke University. I have worked with the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration (NASA) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), 
among other organizations, and have run businesses all over the world, many of 
which are highly technical in nature. I have served on technical government 
panels. 
2. I am part of the management team of Allied Security Operations Group, LLC, 
(ASOG). ASOG is a group of globally engaged professionals who come from 
various disciplines to include Department of Defense, Secret Service, 
Department of Homeland Security, and the Central Intelligence Agency. It 
provides a range of security services, but has a particular emphasis on 
cybersecurity, open source investigation and penetration testing of networks. We 
employ a wide variety of cyber and cyber forensic analysts. We have patents 
pending in a variety of applications from novel network security applications to 
SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) protection and safe browsing 
solutions for the dark and deep web. For this report, I have relied on these 
experts and resources. 
B. PURPOSE AND PRELIMINARY CONCLUSIONS 
1. The purpose of this forensic audit is to test the integrity of Dominion Voting 
System in how it performed in Antrim County, Michigan for the 2020 election. 
2. We conclude that the Dominion Voting System is intentionally and purposefully 
designed with inherent errors to create systemic fraud and influence election 
results. The system intentionally generates an enormously high number of ballot 
errors. The electronic ballots are then transferred for adjudication. The intentional 
errors lead to bulk adjudication of ballots with no oversight, no transparency, and 
no audit trail. This leads to voter or election fraud. Based on our study, we 
conclude that The Dominion Voting System should not be used in Michigan. We 
further conclude that the results of Antrim County should not have been certified.

8. The Antrim County Clerk and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson have stated that 
the election night error (detailed above by the vote "flip" from Trump to Biden, 
was the result of human error caused by the failure to update the Mancelona 
Township tabulator prior to election night for a down ballot race. We disagree and 
conclude that the vote flip occurred because of machine error built into the voting 
software designed to create error. 
Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson's statement on November 6, 2020 that "[t]the 
correct results always were and continue to be reflected on the tabulator totals 
tape .... " was false. 
The allowable election error rate established by the Federal Election Commission 
guidelines is of 1 in 250,000 ballots (.0008%). We observed an error rate of 
68.05%. This demonstrated a significant and fatal error in security and election 
integrity. 
The results of the Antrim County 2020 election are not certifiable. This is a result 
of machine and/or software error, not human error. 
The tabulation log for the forensic examination of the server for Antrim County 
from December 6, 2020consists of 15,676 individual events, of which 10,667 or 
68.05% of the events were recorded errors. These errors resulted in overall 
tabulation errors or ballots being sent to adjudication. This high error rates proves 
the Dominion Voting System is flawed and does not meet state or federal 
election laws. 
9. These errors occurred after The Antrim County Clerk provided a re-provisioned 
CF card with uploaded software for the Central Lake Precinct on November 6, 
2020. This means the statement by Secretary Benson was false. The Dominion 
Voting System produced systemic errors and high error rates both prior to the 
update and after the update; meaning the update (or lack of update) is not the 
cause of errors. 
2  076P-R000001368_00003 
10. In Central Lake Township there were 1,222 ballots reversed out of 1,491 total 
ballots cast, resulting in an 81.96% rejection rate. All reversed ballots are sent to 
adjudication for a decision by election personnel. 
11. It is critical to understand that the Dominion system classifies ballots into two 
categories, 1) normal ballots and 2) adjudicated ballots. Ballots sent to 
adjudication can be altered by administrators, and adjudication files can be 
moved between different Results Tally and Reporting (RTR) terminals with no 
audit trail of which administrator actually adjudicates (i.e. votes) the ballot batch. 
This demonstrated a significant and fatal error in security and election integrity 
because it provides no meaningful observation of the adjudication process or 
audit trail of which administrator actually adjudicated the ballots. 
12. A staggering number of votes required adjudication. This was a 2020 issue not 
seen in previous election cycles still stored on the server. This is caused by 
intentional errors in the system. The intentional errors lead to bulk adjudication of 
ballots with no oversight, no transparency or audit trail. Our examination of the 
server logs indicates that this high error rate was incongruent with patterns from 
previous years. The statement attributing these issues to human error is not 
consistent with the forensic evaluation, which points more correctly to systemic 
machine and/or software errors. The systemic errors are intentionally designed to 
create errors in order to push a high volume of ballots to bulk adjudication. 
13. The linked video demonstrates how to cheat at adjudication: 
https://mobile.twitter.com/KanekoaTheGreat/status/1336888454538428418 
14. Antrim County failed to properly update its system. A purposeful lack of providing 
basic computer security updates in the system software and hardware 
demonstrates incompetence, gross negligence, bad faith, and/or willful non­
compliance in providing the fundamental system security required by federal and 
state law. There is no way this election management system could have passed 
tests or have been legally certified to conduct the 2020 elections in Michigan 
under the current laws. According to the National Conference of State 
Legislatures -Michigan requires full compliance with federal standards as 
determined by a federally accredited voting system laboratory. 
15. Significantly, the computer system shows vote adjudication logs for prior years; 
but all adjudication log entries for the 2020 election cycle are missing. The 
adjudication process is the simplest way to manually manipulate votes. The lack 
of records prevents any form of audit accountability, and their conspicuous 
absence is extremely suspicious since the files exist for previous years using the 
same software. Removal of these files violates state law and prevents a 
meaningful audit, even if the Secretary wanted to conduct an audit. We must 
conclude that the 2020 election cycle records have been manually removed. 
3  076P-R000001368_00004 
16. Likewise, all server security logs prior to 11 :03 pm on November 4, 2020 are 
missing. This means that all security logs for the day after the election, on 
election day, and prior to election day are gone. Security logs are very important 
to an audit trail, forensics, and for detecting advanced persistent threats and 
outside attacks, especially on systems with outdated system files. These logs 
would contain domain controls, authentication failures, error codes, times users 
logged on and off, network connections to file servers between file accesses, 
internet connections, times, and data transfers. Other server logs before 
November 4, 2020 are present; therefore, there is no reasonable explanation for 
the security logs to be missing. 
17. On November 21, 2020, an unauthorized user unsuccessfully attempted to zero 
out election results. This demonstrates additional tampering with data. 
18. The Election Event Designer Log shows that Dominion lmageCast Precinct 
Cards were programmed with new ballot programming on 10/23/2020 and then 
again after the election on 11/05/2020. These system changes affect how ballots 
are read and tabulated, and our examination demonstrated a significant change 
in voter results using the two different programs. In accordance with the Help 
America Vote Act, this violates the 90-day Safe Harbor Period which prohibits 
changes to election systems, registries, hardware/software updates without 
undergoing re-certification. According to the National Conference of State 
Legislatures -Michigan requires full compliance with federal standards as 
determined by a federally accredited voting system laboratory. 
19. The only reason to change software after the election would be to obfuscate 
evidence of fraud and/or to correct program errors that would de-certify the 
election. Our findings show that the Central Lake Township tabulator tape totals 
were significantly altered by utilizing two different program versions (10/23/2020 
and 11/05/2020), both of which were software changes during an election which 
violates election law, and not just human error associated with the Dominion 
Election Management System. This is clear evidence of software generated 
movement of votes. The claims made on the Office of the Secretary of State 
website are false. 
20. The Dominion lmageCast Precinct (ICP) machines have the ability to be 
connected to the internet (see Image 11 ). By connecting a network scanner to 
the ethernet port on the ICP machine and creating Packet Capture logs from the 
machines we examined show the ability to connect to the network, Application 
Programming Interface (API) (a data exchange between two different systems) 
calls and web (http) connections to the Election Management System server. 
Best practice is to disable the network interface card to avoid connection to the 
internet. This demonstrated a significant and fatal error in security and election 
integrity. Because certain files have been deleted, we have not yet found origin 
or destination; but our research continues. 
4  076P-R000001368_00005 
21. Because the intentional high error rate generates large numbers of ballots to be 
adjudicated by election personnel, we must deduce that bulk adjudication 
occurred. However, because files and adjudication logs are missing, we have not 
yet determined where the bulk adjudication occurred or who was responsible for 
it. Our research continues. 
22. Research is ongoing. However, based on the preliminary results, we conclude 
that the errors are so significant that they call into question the integrity and 
legitimacy of the results in the Antrim County 2020 election to the point that the 
results are not certifiable. Because the same machines and software are used in 
48 other counties in Michigan, this casts doubt on the integrity of the entire 
election in the state of Michigan. 
23. DNI Responsibilities: President Obama signed Executive Order on National 
Critical Infrastructure on 6 January 2017, stating in Section 1. Cybersecurity of 
Federal Networks, "The Executive Branch operates its information technology 
(IT) on behalf of the American people. The President will hold heads of executive 
departments and agencies (agency heads) accountable for managing 
cybersecurity risk to their enterprises. In addition, because risk management 
decisions made by agency heads can affect the risk to the executive branch as a 
whole, and to national security, it is also the policy of the United States to 
manage cybersecurity risk as an executive branch enterprise." President 
Obama's EO further stated, effective immediately, each agency head shall use 
The Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (the 
Framework) developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology." 
Support to Critical Infrastructure at Greatest Risk. The Secretary of Homeland 
Security, in coordination with the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the 
Director of National Intelligence, the Director of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation, the heads of appropriate sector-specific agencies, as defined in 
Presidential Policy Directive 21 of February 12, 2013 (Critical Infrastructure 
Security and Resilience) (sector-specific agencies), and all other appropriate 
agency heads, as identified by the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall: (i) 
identify authorities and capabilities that agencies could employ to support the 
cybersecurity efforts of critical infrastructure entities identified pursuant to section 
9 of Executive Order 13636 of February 12, 2013 (Improving Critical 
Infrastructure Cybersecurity), to be at greatest risk of attacks that could 
reasonably result in catastrophic regional or national effects on public health or 
safety, economic security, or national security (section 9 entities); 
This is a national security imperative. In July 2018, President Trump 
strengthened President Obama's Executive Order to include requirements 
to ensure US election systems, processes, and its people were not 
manipulated by foreign meddling, either through electronic or systemic 
manipulation, social media, or physical changes made in hardware, 
software, or supporting systems. The 2018 Executive Order. Accordingly, I 
hereby order: 
5  076P-R000001368_00006 
Section 1. (a) Not later than 45 days after the conclusion of a United States 
election, the Director of National Intelligence, in consultation with the heads of 
any other appropriate executive departments and agencies (agencies), shall 
conduct an assessment of any information indicating that a foreign government, 
or any person acting as an agent of or on behalf of a foreign government, has 
acted with the intent or purpose of interfering in that election. The assessment 
shall identify, to the maximum extent ascertainable, the nature of any foreign 
interference and any methods employed to execute it, the persons involved, and 
the foreign government or governments that authorized, directed, sponsored, or 
supported it. The Director of National Intelligence shall deliver this assessment 
and appropriate supporting information to the President, the Secretary of State, 
the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, 
and the Secretary of Homeland Security. 
We recommend that an independent group should be empaneled to determine 
the extent of the adjudication errors throughout the State of Michigan. This is a 
national security issue. 
24. Michigan resident Gustavo Delfino, a former professor of mathematics in 
Venezuela and alumni of University of Michigan, offered a compelling affidavit 
[Exhibit 21 recognizing the inherent vulnerabilities in the SmartMatic electronic 
voting machines (software which was since incorporated into Dominion Voting 
Systems) during the 2004 national referendum in Venezuela (see attached 
declaration). After 4 years of research and 3 years of undergoing intensive peer 
review, Professor Delfino's paper was published in the highly respected 
"Statistical Science" journal, November 2011 issue (Volume 26, Number 4) with 
title "Analysis of the 2004 Venezuela Referendum: The Official Results Versus 
the Petition Signatures." The intensive study used multiple mathematical 
approaches to ascertain the voting results found in the 2004 Venezuelan 
referendum. Delfino and his research partners discovered not only the algorithm 
used to manipulate the results, but also the precise location in the election 
processing sequence where vulnerability in machine processing would provide 
such an opportunity. According to Prof Delfino, the magnitude of the difference 
between the official and the true result in Venezuela estimated at 1,370,000 
votes. Our investigation into the error rates and results of the Antrim County 
voting tally reflect the same tactics, which have also been reported in other 
Michigan counties as well. This demonstrates a national security issue. 
C. PROCESS 
We visited Antrim County twice: November 27, 2020 and December 6, 2020. 
On November 27, 2020, we visited Central Lake Township, Star Township, and 
Mancelona Township. We examined the Dominion Voting Systems tabulators 
and tabulator roles. 
6  076P-R000001368_00007 
On December 6, 2020, we visited the Antrim County Clerk's office. We inspected 
and performed forensic duplication of the following: 
1. Antrim County Election Management Server running Dominion 
Democracy Suite 5.5.3-002; 
2. Compact Flash cards used by the local precincts in their Dominion 
lmageCast Precinct; 
3. USB memory sticks used by the Dominion VAT (Voter Assist 
Terminals); and 
4. USB memory sticks used for the Poll Book. 
Dominion voting system is a Canadian owned company with global subsidiaries. 
It is owned by Staple Street Capital which is in turn owned by UBS Securities 
LLC, of which 3 out of their 7 board members are Chinese nationals. The 
Dominion software is licensed from Smartmatic which is a Venezuelan owned 
and controlled company. Dominion Server locations have been determined to be 
in Serbia, Canada, the US, Spain and Germany. 
D. CENTRAL LAKE TOWNSHIP 
1. On November 27, 2020, part of our forensics team visited the Central Lake 
Township in Michigan to inspect the Dominion lmageCast Precint for possible 
hardware issues on behalf of a local lawsuit filed by Michigan attorney Matthew 
DePerno on behalf of William Bailey. In our conversations with the clerk of 
Central Lake Township Ms. Judith L. Kosloski, she presented to us "two 
separate paper totals tape" from Tabulator ID 2. 
• One dated "Poll Opened Nov. 03/2020 06:38:48" (Roll 1 ); 
• Another dated "Poll Opened Nov.06/2020 09:21 :58" (Roll 2). 
2. We were then told by Ms. Kosloski that on November 5, 2020, Ms. Kosloski 
was notified by Connie Wing of the County Clerk's Office and asked to bring the 
tabulator and ballots to the County Clerk's office for re-tabulation. They ran the 
ballots and printed "Roll 2". She noticed a difference in the votes and brought it 
up to the clerk, but canvasing still occurred, and her objections were not 
addressed. 
3. Our team analyzed both rolls and compared the results. Roll 1 had 1,494 total 
votes and Roll 2 had 1,491 votes (Roll 2 had 3 less ballots because 3 ballots 
were damaged in the process.) 
4. "Statement of Votes Cast from Antrim" shows that only 1,491 votes were 
counted, and the 3 ballots that were damaged were not entered into final results. 
7  076P-R000001368_00008 
5. Ms. Kosloski stated that she and her assistant manually refilled out the three 
ballots, curing them, and ran them through the ballot counting system -but the 
final numbers do not reflect the inclusion of those 3 damaged ballots. 
6. This is the most preliminary report of serious election fraud indicators. In 
comparing the numbers on both rolls, we estimate 1,474 votes changed 
across the two rolls, between the first and the second time the exact same ballots 
were run through the County Clerk's vote counting machine -which is almost the 
same number of voters that voted in total. 
• 7 42 votes were added to School Board Member for Central lake 
Schools (3) 
• 657 votes were removed from School Board Member for Ellsworth 
Schools (2) 
• 7 votes were added to the total for State Proposal 20-1 (1) and out of 
those there were 611 votes moved between the Yes and No Categories. 
7. There were incremental changes throughout the rolls with some significant 
adjustments between the 2 rolls that were reviewed. This demonstrates 
conclusively that votes can be and were changed during the second machine 
count after the software update. That should be impossible especially at such a 
high percentage to total votes cast. 
8. For the School Board Member for Central lake Schools (3) [Image 1] there 
were 742 votes added to this vote total. Since multiple people were elected, this 
did not change the result of both candidates being elected, but one does see a 
change in who had most votes. If it were a single-person election this would 
have changed the outcome and demonstrates conclusively that votes can be and 
were changed during the second machine counting. That should be impossible.

9. For the School Board Member for Ellsworth Schools (2) [Image 2] 
• Shows 657 votes being removed from this election. 
• In this case, only 3 people who were eligible to vote actually voted. 
Since there were 2 votes allowed for each voter to cast. 
• The recount correctly shows 6 votes. 
But on election night, there was a major calculation issue:

10. In State Proposal 20-1 (1), [Image 3] there is a major change in votes in this 
category. 
• There were 774 votes for YES during the election, to 1,083 votes 
for YES on the recount a change of 309 votes. 
• 7 votes were added to the total for State Proposal 20-1 (1) out of 
those there were 611 votes moved between the Yes and No Categories. 
[Image 3]: 
9  076P-R000001368_00010 
11. State Proposal 20-1 (1) is a fairly technical and complicated proposed 
amendment to the Michigan Constitution to change the disposition and allowable 
uses of future revenue generated from oil and gas bonuses, rentals and royalties 
from state-owned land. Information about the proposal:

resources-trust-fund 
12. A Proposed Initiated Ordinance to Authorize One (1) Marihuana (sic) Retailer 
Establishment Within the Village of Central lake (1). [Image 4] 
• On election night, it was a tie vote. 
• Then, on the rerun of ballots 3 ballots were destroyed, but only one vote 
changed on the totals to allow the proposal to pass. 
When 3 ballots were not counted and programming change on the 
tabulator was installed the proposal passed with 1 vote being removed from 
the No vote. 
[Image 4]: 
10  076P-R000001368_00011 
13. On Sunday December 6, 2020, our forensics team visited the Antrim County 
Clerk. There were two USB memory sticks used, one contained the software 
package used to tabulate election results on November 3, 2020, and the other 
was programmed on November 6, 2020 with a different software package which 
yielded significantly different voting outcomes. The election data package is used 
by the Dominion Democracy Suite software & election management system 
software to upload programming information onto the Compact Flash Cards for 
the Dominion lmageCast Precinct to enable it to calculate ballot totals. 
14. This software programming should be standard across all voting machines 
systems for the duration of the entire election if accurate tabulation is the 
expected outcome as required by US Election Law. This intentional difference in 
software programming is a design feature to alter election outcomes. 
15. The election day outcomes were calculated using the original software 
programming on November 3, 2020. On November 5, 2020 the township clerk 
was asked to re-run the Central Lake Township ballots and was given no 
explanation for this unusual request. On November 6, 2020 the Antrim County 
Clerk, Sheryl Guy issued the second version of software to re-run the same 
Central Lake Township ballots and oversaw the process. This resulted in greater 
than a 60% change in voting results, inexplicably impacting every single election 
contest in a township with less than 1500 voters. These errors far exceed the 
ballot error rate standard of 1 in 250,000 ballots (.0008%) as required by federal 
election law. 
• The original election programming files are last dated 09/25/2020 1 :24pm 
• The updated election data package files are last dated 10/22/2020 10:27 am. 
11  076P-R000001368_00012 
16. As the tabulator tape totals prove, there were large numbers of votes switched 
from the November 3, 2020 tape to the November 6, 2020 tape. This was solely 
based on using different software versions of the operating program to calculate 
votes, not tabulate votes. This is evidenced by using same the Dominion System 
with two different software program versions contained on the two different USB 
Memory Devices. 
17. The Help America Vote Act, Safe Harbor provides a 90-day period prior to 
elections where no changes can be made to election systems. To make changes 
would require recertification of the entire system for use in the election. The 
Dominion User Guide prescribes the proper procedure to test machines with test 
ballots to compare the results to validate machine functionality to determine if the 
Dominion lmageCast Precinct was programmed correctly. If this occurred a 
ballot misconfiguration would have been identified. Once the software was 
updated to the 10/22/2020 software the test ballots should have been re-run to 
validate the vote totals to confirm the machine was configured correctly. 
18. The November 6, 2020 note from The Office of the Secretary of State Jocelyn 
Benson states: "The correct results always were and continue to be reflected on 
the tabulator totals tape and on the ballots themselves. Even if the error in the 
reported unofficial results had not been quickly noticed, it would have been 
identified during the county canvass. Boards of County Canvassers, which are 
composed of 2 Democrats and 2 Republicans, review the printed totals tape from 
each tabulator during the canvass to verify the reported vote totals are correct."

,00.htrn! 
19. The Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson's statement is false. Our findings show 
that the tabulator tape totals were significantly altered by utilization of two 
different program versions, and not just the Dominion Election Management 
System. This is the opposite of the claim that the Office of the Secretary of 
State made on its website. The fact that these significant errors were not caught 
in ballot testing and not caught by the local county clerk shows that there are 
major inherent built-in vulnerabilities and process flaws in the Dominion 
Election Management System, and that other townships/precincts and the 
entire election have been affected. 
20. On Sunday December 6, 2020, our forensics team visited the Antrim County 
Clerk office to perform forensic duplication of the Antrim County Election 
Management Server running Dominion Democracy Suite 5.5.3-002. 
21. Forensic copies of the Compact Flash cards used by the local precincts in their 
Dominion lmageCast Precinct were inspected, USB memory sticks used by 
the Dominion VAT (Voter Assist Terminals) and the USB memory sticks used 
for the Poll Book were forensically duplicated. 
12  076P-R000001368_00013 
22. We have been told that the ballot design and configuration for the Dominion 
lmageCast Precinct and VAT were provided by ElectionSource.com which is 
which is owned by MC&E, Inc of Grand Rapids, Ml. 
E. MANCELONA TOWNSHIP 
1. In Mancelona township, problems with software versions were also known to 
have been present. Mancelona elections officials understood that ballot 
processing issued were not accurate and used the second version of software to 
process votes on 4 November, again an election de-certifying event, as no 
changes to the election system are authorized by law in the 90 days preceding 
elections without re-certification. 
2. Once the 10/22/2020 software update was performed on the Dominion 
lmageCast Precinct the test ballot process should have been performed to 
validate the programming. There is no indication that this procedure was 
performed. 
F. ANTRIM COUNTY CLERK'S OFFICE 
1. Pursuant to a court ordered inspection, we participated in an onsite collection 
effort at the Antrim County Clerk's office on December 6, 2020. [Image 5]: 
Among other items forensically collected, the Antrim County Election 
Management Server (EMS) with Democracy Suite was forensically collected. 
[Images 6 and 7]. 
13  076P-R000001368_00014 
The EMS (Election Management Server) was a: 
Dell Precision Tower 3420. 
Service Tag: 6NB0KH2 
The EMS contained 2 hard drives in a RAID-1 configuration. That is the 2 drives 
redundantly stored the same information and the server could continue to 
operate if either of the 2 hard drives failed. The EMS was booted via the Linux 
Boot USB memory sticks and both hard drives were forensically imaged. 
At the onset of the collection process we observed that the initial program thumb 
drive was not secured in the vault with the CF cards and other thumbdrives. We 
watched as the County employees, including Clerk Sheryl Guy searched 
throughout the office for the missing thumb drive. Eventually they found the 
missing thumb drive in an unsecured and unlocked desk drawer along with 
multiple other random thumb drives. This demonstrated a significant and fatal 
error in security and election integrity. 
G. FORENSIC COLLECTION 
We used a built for purpose Linux Boot USB memory stick to boot the EMS in a 
forensically sound mode. We then used Ewfacquire to make a forensic image of 
the 2 independent internal hard drives. 
Ewfacquire created an E01 file format forensic image with built-in integrity 
verification via MD5 hash. 
We used Ewfverify to verify the forensic image acquired was a true and accurate 
copy of the original disk. That was done for both forensic images. 
H. ANALYSIS TOOLS 
14  076P-R000001368_00015 
X-Ways Forensics: We used X-Ways Forensics, a commercial Computer 
Forensic tool, to verify the image was useable and full disk encryption was not in 
use. In particular we confirmed that Bit locker was not in use on the EMS. 
Other tools used: PassMark -OSForensics, Truxton -Forensics, Cellebrite -
Physical Analyzer, Blackbag-Blacklight Forensic Software, Microsoft SQL Server 
Management Studio, Virtual Box, and miscellaneous other tools and scripts. 
I. SERVER OVERVIEW AND SUMMARY 
1. Our initial audit on the computer running the Democracy Suite Software showed 
that standard computer security best practices were not applied. These 
minimum-security standards are outlined the 2002 HAVA, and FEC Voting 
System Standards -it did not even meet the minimum standards required of a 
government desktop computer. 
2. The election data software package USB drives (November 2020 election, and 
November 2020 election updated) are secured with bitlocker encryption software, 
but they were not stored securely on-site. At the time of our forensic examination, 
the election data package files were already moved to an unsecure desktop 
computer and were residing on an unencrypted hard drive. This demonstrated a 
significant and fatal error in security and election integrity. Key Findings on 
Desktop and Server Configuration: -There were multiple Microsoft security 
updates as well as Microsoft SQL Server updates which should have been 
deployed, however there is no evidence that these security patches were ever 
installed. As described below, many of the software packages were out of date 
and vulnerable to various methods of attack. 
a) Computer initial configuration on 10/03/2018 13:08:11 :911 
b) Computer final configuration of server software on 4/10/2019 
c) Hard Drive not Encrypted at Rest 
d) Microsoft SQL Server Database not protected with password. 
e) Democracy Suite Ad min Passwords are reused and share passwords. 
f) Antivirus is 4.5 years outdated 
g) Windows updates are 3.86 years out of date. 
h) When computer was last configured on 04/10/2019 the windows updates 
were 2.11 years out of date. 
i) User of computer uses a Super User Account.

3. The hard drive was not encrypted at rest -which means that if hard drives are 
removed or initially booted off an external USB drive the files are susceptible to 
manipulation directly. An attacker is able to mount the hard drive because it is 
unencrypted, allowing for the manipulation and replacement of any file on the 
system. 
4. The Microsoft SQL Server database files were not properly secured to allow 
modifications of the database files. 
5. The Democracy Suite Software user account logins and passwords are stored in 
the unsecured database tables and the multiple Election System Administrator 
accounts share the same password, which means that there are no audit trails 
for vote changes, deletions, blank ballot voting, or batch vote alterations or 
adjudication. 
6. Antivirus definition is 1666 days old on 12/11/2020. Antrim County updates its 
system with USB drives. USB drives are the most common vectors for injecting 
malware into computer systems. The failure to properly update the antivirus 
definition drastically increases the harm cause by malware from other machines 
being transmitted to the voting system. 
7. Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) Offline Update is used to enable 
updates the computer -which is a package of files normally downloaded from 
the internet but compiled into a program to put on a USB drive to manually 
update server systems. 
8. Failure to properly update the voting system demonstrates a significant and fatal 
error in security and election integrity. 
9. There are 15 additional updates that should have been installed on the server to 
adhere to Microsoft Standards to fix known vulnerabilities. For the 4/10/2019 
install, the most updated version of the update files would have been 03/13/2019 
which is 11.6.1 which is 15 updates newer than 10.9.1 
This means the updates installed were 2 years, 1 month, 13 days behind 
the most current update at the time. This includes security updates and 
fixes. This demonstrated a significant and fatal error in security and 
election integrity.

10. Super User Administrator account is the primary account used to operate the 
Dominion Election Management System which is a major security risk. The 
user logged in has the ability to make major changes to the system and install 
software which means that there is no oversight to ensure appropriate 
management controls -i.e. anyone who has access to the shared administrator 
user names and passwords can make significant changes to the entire voting 
system. The shared usernames and passwords mean that these changes can 
be made in an anonymous fashion with no tracking or attribution. 
J. ERROR RATES 
1. We reviewed the Tabulation logs in their entirety for 11/6/2020. The election logs 
for Antrim County consist of 15,676 total lines or events. 
• Of the 15,676 there were a total of 10,667 critical errors/warnings or a 
68.05% error rate. 
• Most of the errors were related to configuration errors that could result in 
overall tabulation errors or adjudication. These 11/6/2020 tabulation totals 
were used as the official results. 
2. For examples, there were 1,222 ballots reversed out of 1,491 total ballots cast, 
thus resulting in an 81.96% rejection rate. Some of which were reversed due to 
"Ballot's size exceeds maximum expected ballot size". 
• According to the NCSL, Michigan requires testing by a federally accredited 
laboratory for voting systems. In section 4.1.1 of the Voluntary Voting 
Systems Guidelines (WSG) Accuracy Requirements a. All systems shall 
achieve a report total error rate of no more than one in 125,000. 
• https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/eac assets/1/28NVSG.1.1.V 
OL.1.FINAL 1.pdf 
• In section 4.1.3.2 Memory Stability of the WSG it states that Memory 
devices used to retain election management data shall have 
demonstrated error free data retention for a period of 22 months. 
• In section 4.1.6.1 Paper-based System Processing Requirements sub­
section a. of the WSG it states "The ability of the system to produce and 
receive electronic signals from the scanning of the ballot, perform logical 
and numerical operations upon these data, and reproduce the contents of 
memory when required shall be sufficiently free of error to enable 
17  076P-R000001368_00018 
satisfaction of the system-level accuracy requirement indicated in 
Subsection 4.1.1." 
• These are not human errors; this is definitively related to the software and 
software configurations resulting in error rates far beyond the thresholds 
listed in the guidelines. 
3. A high "error rate" in the election software (in this case 68.05%) reflects an 
algorithm used that will weight one candidate greater than another (for instance, 
weight a specific candidate at a 2/3 to approximately 1/3 ratio). In the logs we 
identified that the RCV or Ranked Choice Voting Algorithm was enabled (see 
image below from the Dominion manual). This allows the user to apply a 
weighted numerical value to candidates and change the overall result. The 
declaration of winners can be done on a basis of points, not votes. [Image 8]: 
choice voting results are evaluated on a district per district basis and each 
district has a set number of points (1.00). Elimination and declaration of 
winners is done on basis of points, not votes. 
Figure 11-3: RCV Profile screen 
4. The Dominion software configuration logs in the Divert Options, shows that all 
write-in ballots were flagged to be diverted automatically for adjudication. This 
means that all write-in ballots were sent for "adjudication" by a poll worker or 
election official to process the ballot based on voter "intent". Adjudication files 
allow a computer operator to decide to whom to award those votes (or to trash 
them). 
5. In the logs all but two of the Override Options were enabled on these machines, 
thus allowing any operator to change those votes. [Image 9]:

6. 
7. In the logs all but two of the Override Options were enabled on these machines, 
thus allowing any operator to change those votes. This gives the system 
operators carte blanche to adjudicate ballots, in this case 81.96% of the total cast 
ballots with no audit trail or oversight. [Image 1 O]: 
On 12/8/2020 Microsoft issued 58 security patches across 1 O+ products, some of 
which were used for the election software machine, server and programs. Of the 
58 security fixes 22, were patches to remote code execution (RCE) 
vulnerabilities. [Image 11 ]:

8. We reviewed the Election Management System logs (Emslogger) in their 
entirety from 9/19/2020 through 11/21/2020 for the Project: Antrim November 
2020. There were configuration errors throughout the set-up, election and 
tabulation of results. The last error for Central Lake Township, Precinct 1 
occurred on 11/21/2020 at 14:35:11 System.Xml.XmlException 
System.Xml.XmlException: The'' character, hexadecimal value 0x20, cannot be 
included in a name. Bottom line is that this is a calibration that rejects the vote 
(see picture below). [Image 12]: 
20  076P-R000001368_00021 
Notably 42 minutes earlier on Nov 21 2020 at 13:53:09 a user attempted to 
zero out election results. ld:3168 Emslogger -There is no permission to {0} 
-Project: User: Thread: 189. This is direct proof of an attempt to tamper 
with evidence. 
9. The Election Event Designer Log shows that Dominion lmageCast Precinct 
Cards were programmed with updated new programming on 10/23/2020 and 
again after the election on 11/05/2020. As previously mentioned, this violates the 
HAVA safe harbor period.
