Re: Pennsylvania cell numbers blast text and Twitter blast out request for 9am tomorrow/Saturday 
Draft Arizona tweet and text below. 12pm ET tomorrow/Saturday would be ideal for blasting both since they're 
Mountain Time.

We can just blame Boris. 
Alternatively, is Arizona ok to target tomorrow instead, Alex?

I think we should not tread into this territory. Per outside counsel we can all be 
subject to discipline and criminal investigation by the state AG .... a liberal 
Democrat it's political ambition. I recommend against doing this in PA.

Did some additional research and spoke to Jones Day about PA. PA laws on this 
are very stringent. 
The fine can be up to $25K and it can be prosecuted as a criminal misdemeanor. 
Also, attorneys who are engaged in lobbying (including as legal advisors to 
unregistered lobbyists) can be referred to relevant disciplinary committees. 
Given that fact, if we are going to move forward with this kind of activity in PA, I 
cannot advise further on it.

The administrative body can fine a relatively small amount. But the matter can be 
referred to the state AG for further investigation and prosecution (not sure if it's a 
civil violation or a criminal matter) -in any event, that's where the real costs 
would come into play. 
I'm not an expert in this area and we'd need outside counsel to advise us. I can 
ask Jones Day to look more closely at the PA laws if you'd like.

Jason -PA has grassroots lobbying registration laws. There's a 
risk of a fine for doing this in PA. We've lived with this risk 
before, but I want to note it again.
