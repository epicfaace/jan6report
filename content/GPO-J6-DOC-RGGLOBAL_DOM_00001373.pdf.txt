CONFIDENTIAL RGGLOBAL_DOM_00001373  Good morning, Thomas, 
Mayor Giuliani has approved the attached complaint/motion for stay. We need someone from the 
campaign familiar with NM to sign the verification. Can you take a look at these docs and let me know if 
you're willing to be the affiant for this case, please? We're ready to file, but need an affiant. Let me 
know if you have questions. 
Thanks! 
Christina

Mike, 
Per Matt below, I need someone who can sign the verified complaint in NM. I've attached both the 
complaint/motion for stay and the affidavit. Do you have a recommendation for who can sign it? 
Thanks!

Christina, 
In all of the Campaign's other election-related lawsuits, for which there was a verified complaint, 
someone from Mike Roman's team signed to verify the complaint (in PA, in GA, in AZ, etc.). 
I've not seen the complaint and I can't speak to the factual allegations. I can't sign that under 
penalty of perjury. 
I recommend Boris, or Jenna, or someone from Mike Roman's team. Those who have been 
tracking the New Mexico matters and can actually speak to the underlying factual allegations 
should sign the verification . 
Best, 
Matt

Good morning, Matt, 
I spoke with Mayor Giuliani and he recommended that you be the affiant, as a rep from the campaign. 
Can I give your name to local counsel and fill in the blanks with your name? 
Respectfully, 
Christina

Team, 
We are ready to file the complaint in New Mexico. The attorney just sent me the attached affidavit that 
is required to accompany the complaint. Mayor Giuliani approved the complaint. Whose name should 
we include in the affidavit? Thanks.
