Eric-Justin-Tim: 
Just got a call from Rudy: 
-He said tomorrow our local counsels 
in four states are filing federal cases 
to keep the effort going (I didn't 
understand merits of cases), and that 
POTUS was aware of this. 
-He said he1s optimistic we win in 
Wisconsin state court tomorrow. 
-He also said Boris has been 
coordinating state elector whip effort 
and I should connect with he and 
Christina BOBB. 
All I know is tomorrow is Elector 
Voting Day and that train you hear 
coming down the track isn't 
Burlington Northern. 
Finally, it looks like Fox News and 
maybe even Sinclair will take our 
revised TV spot, so we need to make 
the call if we're going to go up there 
too.

How best do proceed tomorrow so 
we don't look like a donkey show, 
particularly on the Comms/media 
front? 
Thanks! 
Justin, I'll call soon and we'll talk with 
boss

That's fine .. 
FWIW Maria1s producer just called 
and said they heard an official 
announcement that we won the 
election was coming tomorrow, 
following a call POTUS had with Brian 
Kilmeade this AM. 
I asked if they hadn't been following 
POTUS' Twitter account.:) 
Eric, Justin -just let Tim and I know 
what to expect for tomorrow -
POTUS almost assuredly going to be 
worked up by the media coverage 
surrounding electors voting ..

lt1s rather anti-climactic. Throughout 
the day the electors will vote in each 
state capital. In AZ WI NV GA Ml our 
slates of electors will also vote. PA 
probably won't happen. They will be 
called invalid and out of order (and 
they1re probably right) but Tim has 
, our quote 
Yes it does 01

Nowr I am not sure what Rudy is 
telling the President on this stuff so 
I'm not sure what his expectations 
are. Jason any insight? 
Everything I know I spelled out earlier. 
Was caught a little off-guard by his 
asking me what was going on. 
Here's the thing the way this has 
morphed it's a crazy play so I don't 
know who wants to put their name on 
it. 
Eric. 
Eric who? There's no Eric on this 
chain

Eric, Justin -WH will call us back 
ASAP. 
In the meantime, POTUS wants to put 
out statement on electors, so Rudy 
making me call into conference call 
now. 
From Boris: 
Hey Team -Mayor asked for 
everyone on this call to get on a quick 
call. 
Can we all dial on at 4pm on this line?

We need to mail him down on no 
more money 
Done already 
No more cases 
You should call Christina DANN and 
tell her that. 
Or Eric, as he's in charge. 
Eric. 
Or Justin.

Of nothing ... not even my kids 
I cannot. They need to put their 
names on it. I would put it under 
Rudy, Boris and Jenna 
I agree 
I guess -I'm not sure where the ban 
came from. But they can't 
anonymously stand behind this 
garbage 
XXM-0021357  I guess -I'm not sure where the ban 
came from.. But they can't 
anonymously stand behind this 
garbage 
I would tell them that no one is 
comfortable putting it out and they 
should issue it directly 
Anyway they want where they feel 
comfortable supporting their 
allegations
