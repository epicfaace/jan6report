Subject: RE: L nk to ent re case 
Keep ng Bruce and h s team off th s for the moment. 
Here s the ssue. The comp a nt ncorporates by reference the state court cha enge. A though the Pres dent s gned a 
ver f cat on for that back on Dec. 1, he has s nee been made aware that some of the a egat ons (and ev dence proffered by 
the experts) has been naccurate. For h m to s gn a new verf cat on w th that know edge (and ncorporat on by reference) 
wou d not be accurate. And I have no doubt that an aggress ve DA or US Atty somep ace w go after both the Pres dent 
and h s awyers once a the dust sett es on th s. 
I know t s ate n the day, but do we need to ncorporate that comp ant by reference?
