EXAMINATION 
BY 
Q Can you provide us with your full name? 
A Jacqueline Shay Kotkiewicz. 
Q And how do you spell your middle name? 
A S-h-a-y. 
Q And what's your date of birth? 
A -of â– . 
Q And where do you reside? 
A Currently, I reside in-Washington, D.C. 
Q And what's your cell phone number? 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Is that the number you had in November and December of 2020? 
Yes. 
Do you have an lnstagram account or a Twitter account? 
Yes, I have both. 
And what are your handles for each one?  1 A I believe my Twitter is @jackikotkiewicz. That's spelled, 
2 J-a-c-k-i-k-o-t-k-i-e-w-i-c-z. And I believe my lnstagram account is the same. 
3 
4 
5 Q 
A 
Q 
6 about that? And did you have those in December of 2020 and November 2020? 
Yes. Yes. 
Now, I want to go to your educational background. Can you tell us a bit 
7 A Sure. I graduated from Central Dauphin High School in Harrisburg, 
8 Pennsylvania. And then I attended Gettysburg College in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. 
9 Graduated with a double major in political science and public policy, and minored in 
10 business. And that's it. 
11 Q And what year did you graduate? 
12 A 2019. 
13 Q Okay. So I want to turn to your job for President J. Trump's 
14 for Inc. --Donald J. Trump for President, Inc., the Trump Campaign. 
15 Is your Linkedln public account, is that, as far as you know, accurate as to your 
16 professional background? 
17 
18 A 
Q Yes. 
Okay. Is it accurate that you started working for the Trump Campaign in 
19 September of 2019 as a research analyst? 
20 A Yes. 
21 Q Can you tell us a bit about your role for the Trump Campaign as a research 
22 analyst? I want to start first with the preelection period. 5 
23 A Uh-huh. I mean, that's pretty broad, I would say. It was a combination of 
24 things. Originally, when there were multiple candidates, I was in charge of the Elizabeth 
25 Warren book, building out opposition research on Elizabeth Warren. However, once Joe  6 
1 Biden became the nominee, all of us together turned towards Joe Biden. So I was 
2 specifically in charge of the energy and the environment chapters, as well as the 
3 education chapter and the social issues chapters of the Joe Biden opposition book that 
4 we built out. 
5 And then the other half the time, we would be monitoring when Joe Biden had 
6 live events, whether that was town halls or if he was doing a debate, and we would be 
7 fact-checking him in real time or we would be flagging clips for the war room to clip. 
8 We'd also monitor Sunday shows, if there were any good clips from other Democrat 
9 candidates that we could push around on Twitter. And I think that was the general basis 
10 basically of what my job was. 
11 Q Let's talk about the reporting structure. Who did you report to as a 
12 research analyst? And let's --
13 
14 A 
Q Sure. 
Let's do for the period of 2020. So if it changed over 2020, let me know. 
15 But from January 2020 forward, who did you report to? 
16 A It slightly changed. I don't know when exactly. So it was always --Zach 
17 Parkinson is the research director. At one point, Dean Cleary, he was a research analyst 
18 with me. He became promoted to our deputy research director. So then I reported to 
19 both Dean Cleary and Zach Parkinson. 
20 Q Okay. And who were the other research analysts with you in 2020? And 
21 let's start with the preelection period, and to the extent that changed post-election, then 
22 tell us that. 
23 A Yup. So we had Matt VanHyfte. There was myself, a girl named Kiersten 
24 Pels, Luis Cornelio, I believe, Brent Perrin, Dean Cleary, and then David Brown. I believe 
25 that's all of us. And then after the election, it was just myself, Matt VanHyfte, and Dean  1 that were asked to stay on longer. 
2 Q And when --was that from election day forward, or at what point did that 
3 determination get made? 
4 
5 A 
Q I think it was November 15th, if I remember correctly, but I'm not positive. 
So from election day, November 3rd, to November 15th, was the research 
6 team still as --the same general folks you mentioned earlier? 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Yes. 
Who did you understand Zach Parkinson to report to? 
I believe he reported to Tim Murtaugh. 
And that's the communications director, correct? 
Yes. 
So is it fair to say the research team sat within the com ms department? 
Yes, kind of. Originally, we sat in the war room, which was right outside of 
14 Tim Murtaugh's office. Later, we kind of got pushed down to a different part of the 
15 office, so we were closer to the strategic communications area but all within com ms. 
16 
17 Q 
A And when you say the office, what are you referencing? 
I don't remember the address, but it's in Arlington, on the 14th floor. 
18 don't remember the address, so --
19 Q Okay. Now, preelection, did there come a time where you were 
20 asked --you were asked to research anything related to fraud or voting irregularities 
21 preelection? 
22 
23 A 
Q I don't believe so. 
Are you aware of anyone else being asked to do any research related to 
24 fraud claims or anything of the like? 
25 A Before the election? 7  1 
2 
3 Q 
A 
Q Before the election. 
No, I don't believe so. No. I don't believe so. 
Before the election, did you do any research regarding fund raising emails or 
4 fundraising texts? 
5 
6 
7 A 
Q In what capacity? 
As to the accuracy of statements made there within or anything of the like. 
So a fund raising --we understand --just to give you background, and let me know 8 
8 whether you're aware of this. We understand that Zach Parkinson reviewed fundraising 
9 emails and texts during some of his --as part of some of his responsibilities as research 
10 director and deputy comms director. 
11 First, were you aware of that, that he had that role? 
12 
13 A 
Q Yes. 
And did any work related to that effort come down to you or any research 
14 analysts as far as you know? 
15 
16 
17 A 
Q 
A Yes. 
Tell me about that preelection. 
Yeah. It was --I would say it was an almost daily email we would get from 
18 our digital team. Sometimes it was more than once a day, and it would be just a bunch 
19 of generic texts about going out to vote, making sure, you know, for the pre-voting period 
20 where you can go and vote early, getting people to request absentee ballots if they're 
21 eligible, just giving, like, voting information, general, like, texts and emails having to do 
22 with that. It's kind of all over the place. Like, I still do that now in my current role at 
23 the RNC, just generic fundraising and texts. 
24 
25 Q 
A Now, when you say you get this email, who is the we? 
Zach would pass it to the research team. He would just send it, and then  9 
1 one of us would go through --we'd comb through it for edits, to make sure things were 
2 accurate and also like a grammar check. 
3 Q Now, when you say things were accurate, can you explain to me what kind of 
4 things you were looking for? 
5 A Yeah. I mostly just kept an eye out for statistics. So I guess this like --for 
6 instance, gas prices, making sure they're using the correct gas price number, like statistics 
7 like that. 
8 Q So is it fair to say that you were looking for things that could be proven 
9 either true or false? 
10 
11 A 
Q Yes. 
Okay. Would you ever look --I'm going to use the term, like, a political 
12 statement. So someone says, Joe Biden would be the worst President ever. Is it fair to 
13 say that that's not the kind of statement you would research as to truth and accuracy? 
14 Is that fair? 
15 
16 A 
Q That's fair. 
Okay. Now, as far as preelection, the review of fundraising emails and 
17 texts, was it just you reviewing that for the analysts or was this sent to all the analysts? 
18 A It was sent to --I believe, I don't exactly remember, but I believe it was sent 
19 to all the analysts, and we would just take turns every day, because they were quite 
20 lengthy, so one of us a day would kind of go through it. 
21 Q And then when someone had gone through it --so let's say you went 
22 through it, would you --was the email going to Zach Parkinson first who would then 
23 forward it or were you directly receiving the emails from the digital folks? 
24 A No. It would go to Zach Parkinson because, ultimately, he was responsible 
25 for them. So he would do a second review, and then he would on his own send edits  10 
1 back. 
2 Q Okay. So it would go to Zach. He would forward it to the analysts, and 
3 then the analysts would internally know who's turn it was to do the review? 
Uh-huh. Yes. 
Now, post-election, did that continue? 
I do not recall. I do not believe so, but I do not remember. 4 
5 
6 
7 A 
Q 
A 
Q Do you have any recollection of seeing any post-election fundraising emails 
8 or texts? 
9 
10 A 
Q I don't have any recollection. 
Do you recall having any discussions with any other analysts or Zach 
11 Parkinson or anyone else in the com ms department regarding fundraising emails or texts? 
12 
13 A 
Q I do not. 
Were you ever asked to do any research in regards to fund raising emails that 
14 had to do with discussions of a stolen election or election fraud? 
15 
16 A 
Q I do not believe so. 
Did any of your work ever involve researching, preelection, the President's 
17 own statements? 
18 
19 A 
Q Yes. 
Did that involve researching the President's statements regarding the 
20 potential for election fraud or any election fraud related claims? 
21 
22 A 
Q I don't recall, but I don't believe so. 
What kind of statements of the President would you --and to be clear, I 
23 mean President Trump when I'm asking these as the President at that time. 
24 What kind of statements of his would the research team research? 
25 A It would mostly just be fact checks. For instance, if he said  11 
1 something --this is silly. This is a silly example, but for the wind power, like, President 
2 Trump said it killed a lot of birds, and then we would have to do research too, because 
3 Politi Fact or The Washington Post would contact us. So we had to provide evidence or 
4 some type of basis to back up President Trump's statements. Things like that. 
5 Q All right. I want to move forward in 2020, closer to election day. So the 
6 week --let's talk about the week or the days leading into election day, around that time. 
7 The research team, did you all have any preparation for either work that had to do 
8 with election day or the expected work post-election day? So I'm talking about, prior to 
9 election day, were you all preparing for anything? 
10 A We were preparing for election day itself. We were not really preparing for 
11 after election day, I would say. I know broader we were. We had like a legal team, but 
12 not on the research side of things, not myself, no. 
13 Q And what were the preparations the research team was doing for election 
14 day? 
15 A Just myself, I --not everyone. They were just looking for extra bodies as a 
16 backup war room in case something happened with the WiFi, with the actual war room, 
17 where we would just get calls and pass along information and fun tidbits about election 
18 day. So I just went to a meeting about that. Other than that, that was our only 
19 preparation for election day. 
20 
21 Q 
A And when you say the war room, what did the war room do? 
On election day, I actually don't know because I didn't get to be part of it, 
22 because they didn't need a backup war room. 
23 Q What was your understanding, if you were needed, what you would've been 
24 doing? 
25 A I would've been in contact with someone on the ground in one of the States.  12 
1 They would have had to report to me, I think it was every 10, 15, 30 minutes, not sure on 
2 the exact timing, but with what they knew about the vote counts or turnout or things like 
3 that. I'm not exactly sure because I never had to do it. 
4 Q Okay. So let's move forward to election day, November 3rd, 2020. Tell 
5 me about where you were. 
6 
7 A 
Q I was in the Trump Campaign headquarters on the 14th floor. 
And so the results are coming in that evening. What are you doing? Are 
8 you working? Are you just observing the results? 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Just observing the results. 
Are you with anyone else? 
Yeah. I'm with everyone in the office. 
Is it like a big group watch? 
Yes, but we're at our desks. We weren't like partying or drinking anything. 
14 We were sitting on our computers. But I sat in the bullpen, so I was with everyone. 
15 Q Okay. So let's go --the results are going in. Let's go later in the evening, 
16 closer to midnight. So, you know, States have come in and whatnot. Take us to your 
17 thinking about the state of the election around that time. 
18 So prior to President Trump making his statements that he made, tell us about 
19 your personal take on what the results of the election were. 
20 A 
21 results were. 
22 
23 2 a.m.? 
24 
25 Q 
A 
Q I honestly didn't know at that time. No one knew really what the final 
Do you remember President Trump speaking early that day, I think at like 
I was awake, but I don't really remember. I was so tired. 
Did you do any work related to the research team on election day?  13 
1 
2 A 
Q I don't believe so. I don't think we had a lot of work to do on election day. 
So is it fair to say that you didn't work election day, like, as far as you can 
3 recall? 
4 A I'm sure we had some type of project to do. I don't think we were sitting all 
5 day with absolutely nothing to do. But it might have just been making like a Twitter list 
6 or something silly, but I don't know. 
7 Q Okay. So the President speaks. The next day comes, that's 
8 November 4th. Let's kind of walk through that week. 
9 Tell me about what kind of --progress us through as much as you can recall what 
10 happens that week. 
11 A I actually have a very difficult time remembering because we didn't go to 
12 bed till 3 or 4 a.m., like, election night. We were back in office early the next day. 
13 think we were trying to do some opposition research on the FOX News person who called 
14 Arizona to, like, show he had Democrat --like, leaning Democrat bias. And then I 
15 believe it was next day we --might have been a few days after. I don't remember 
16 timeline specifically --the Trump war room hotline started, so I was helping take calls and 
17 working with the online system. And then when I wasn't doing that, I was working on a 
18 dead voter project. 
19 Q So we'll talk about the dead voter project in a minute, but let's start with the 
20 on line --the voter hotline. Who asked you to join with that? 
21 
22 A 
Q I don't remember. 
And tell us about the project. What came out of it, if anything? What 
23 was your experience with it? 
24 A It was terrible. The calls --the people were so mean. It was very sexually 
25 explicit calls. People would play jokes. People would scream in the phone. That's  14 
1 kind of all I remember. I've also blacked that out because people are so mean. 
2 Q Do you recall any substantive leads coming through the voter hotline that 
3 you were a part of? 
4 A I can't speak to how substantial or how credible they were. I'm not sure. 
5 Sometimes some old ladies would call that sounded pretty real, but I wouldn't know. 
6 Q Yeah. Did you ever get any feedback of any successes that came out of the 
7 voter hotline? 
8 
9 
10 
11 A 
Q 
A No. 
Like finding fraud or anything of the sort? 
No. 
Mr. Passantino. Just make sure he gets the chance to get his question all the 
12 way out, just for the benefit of the court reporter. 
13 
14 
15 Ms. Kotkiewicz. Uh-huh. 
BY 
Q So just to be clear, you said that you were not aware of any findings of fraud 
16 that came out of the voter hotline. Is that accurate? 
17 
18 
19 A That's accurate. 
Q And who else staffed the phones for the voter hotline? 
A I don't know everyone who did it. It was a lot of our building, but I don't 
20 know who. 
21 Q Now, on November 4th, I'm looking at what appear to be perhaps G chats 
22 you were having with a colleague. You produced these. Do you know what I'm talking 
23 about? 
24 
25 A Yes. 
Q So on November 4th at 10:11, you have a line when you say to Kyle --and  1 who is Kyle? 
2 
3 A 
Q He was an analyst in the war room. 
And what was his role as an analyst in the war room? 
4 A He would be watching different television shows and clipping things and 15 
5 drafting tweets. I believe that's it. I don't know. I can't specifically speak to what he 
6 did. 
7 
8 
9 Q 
A 
Q Is it fair to say you were friends? 
Yes. 
So on what is marked in your production --we have your whole production 
10 basically marked as exhibit 1, but it is JK121 is the Bates number. And you write to Kyle, 
11 If we count all --you can see there in the middle there. It says, If we count all, quote, 
12 "legally cast," end quote, ballots, we believe we will win. 
13 
14 
15 
16 It seems to cite Bill. Is that Bill Stepien? 
A 
Q 
A Yes. 
And as to this statement, where are you getting that from? 
I think he spoke to us, just kind of a rallying up the troops, to keep working 
17 hard type conversation. And Kyle wasn't there for that, so I took notes for him. 
18 Q So you're basically recounting to Kyle what happened at this rally, basically, 
19 this get the troops going speech? 
20 
21 A 
Q Yes. 
And then you respond what seems to be your analysis, you say in parens, To 
22 me this sounds like it's going to be a huge legal battle. 
23 Tell me about why you wrote that. 
24 A Just because, at the time, we didn't know a lot of information, but there was 
25 a lot of weird things happening with what was getting reported. So it seemed up to like  1 the courts to decide, not up to anything else. 
2 Q When you say a lot of weird things happened, do you mean news reports 
3 regarding fraud? 
4 
5 
6 
7 A 
Q 
A 
Q Yeah. We didn't know what was true, what wasn't true at the time. 
And how were you getting your updates about these kind of claims? 
Just from the news. 
Were you getting updates from within the campaign or just from you 
8 watching the news and Twitter, et cetera? 
9 
10 A 
Q Just from watching the news and Twitter. 
Now, what was your expectation as far as stay in this job and when you 
11 would be leaving or done with the Trump campaign? 
12 A I didn't really know, but I wanted to stay on as long as possible because I 
13 wanted to get paid because I needed to be able to afford housing. 
14 
15 
16 Q 
A 
Q Yeah. Were you at that time, around election day, looking for a new job? 
Yes. 
Okay. Because there's a part in one of your chats, which we don't have 
17 to --it's on JK129, but we don't need to pull it up, where you say --I think you say 
18 something to the effect of, this honestly takes my mind off trying to find a job. 
19 So is it fair to say around election day, you were looking to work elsewhere? 
20 
21 A 
Q Yeah. Just preparing for all circumstances. 
Okay. Did you have expectation that if President Trump had won, you 16 
22 would've stayed with the campaign and gotten a job elsewhere with the White House or 
23 anything, or no? 
24 
25 A 
Q That was my hope, but I couldn't be sure. 
Now, you mentioned that you had the voter fraud line and also researching,  17 
1 you mentioned, dead people. So tell us a bit about how you were asked to research into 
2 whether dead people voted and who asked you to do that. 
3 A Yup. Zach Parkinson asked us, the research team, to look into if these dead 
4 voters voted. So I don't know where the list of names came from, but we received a list, 
5 and then our job was to go try to find the obituaries for these people. And we were able 
6 to confirm some dead voters. That happens in every election. 
7 Q Okay. So we're going to talk in detail, but when you say that happens in 
8 every election, are you --is that your way of indicating that you didn't find any evidence 
9 of wide-scale voter fraud? 
10 A Yeah. That wasn't my ask. I just was asked to look into dead voters, so 
11 that's what I produced. 
12 Q Okay. So walk us through your process. You get a list of names, and then 
13 you do what? 
14 A We would just go on newspapers.com, look for obituaries. Also, on Google, 
15 we'd search their names, make sure, like, things matched. So more than a name 
16 because there's a lot of people with the same first, last names. So making sure it is 
17 identifiable to that person. I believe we also used --maybe we used Nexis, not positive, 
18 but to get, like, locations of where they lived. 
19 Q Okay. So you went to newspaper --so you got a list from Zach Parkinson 
20 that people that he --is it fair to say that these were individuals that he had reason to 
21 believe could have been dead people who, in fact, voted in the election, and he wanted 
22 the research analysts to go and conduct further analysis to confirm that that was, in fact, 
23 the truth? Is that fair? 
24 A Confirm or deny whether they were alive, yes. 
25 Q Now, who was asked to do that in conjunction with you?  18 
1 A I don't really remember because it was just two or three of us at a time that 
2 would get taken off the Trump hotline to go and do this project. So I don't know who all 
3 was asked to. 
4 Q So was this prior to the November 15th kind of demarcation you mentioned 
5 earlier where a lot of people were let go? 
6 
7 A 
Q I believe it was before then. Not positive. 
Is there anyone else on your team who you know --that you recall was 
8 involved in this dead people review? Like Matt, for example. 
9 A I know Dean and Matt definitely did. But I'm not sure about the others. 
10 Q All right. So you would go to newspapers.com. You would perhaps 
11 maybe use Lexis. Any other sources you used in your efforts to confirm or deny this 
12 information? 
13 
14 
15 
16 A 
Q 
A 
Q Google. 
Anything else? 
Not that I can recall, no. 
And what kind of information did Zach Parkinson give you? He gave you a 
17 name, and what else? 
18 A I don't remember what's in the spreadsheet, but I think you guys have that 
19 information. 
Q Yeah, I think you're right. I'll pull that up in a minute. 20 
21 Now, we've seen in the --I'm going to kind of switch gears a bit. We'll come back 
22 to this. 
23 In the documents you produced, tell us a bit about where these docs come from, 
24 how you had access to these documents that we got from you. 
25 A Uh-huh. Yup. I was just handed a flash drive with all of the research  1 documents that we put together. 
2 Q And who handed you that flash drive? 
3 
4 
5 
6 A 
Q 
A 
Q Zach Parkinson. 
And when did he do that? 
Oh, I don't remember. 
Are you asking --are you saying the information that your lawyer produced 
7 to the committee is that flash drive? 
8 A Yes. It's some of the information. It's the information that's specific to 
9 your request. 
Okay. So was this flash drive given to you sometime in November 2020? 
No. 
Okay. When was it given to you? 
I believe when I started working at the RNC. 
And when was that? 19 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A I started April 1st, 2021, at the RNC, but I don't know exactly what day I was 
16 given the flash drive or how many months into work I was given it. 
17 
18 Q 
A Okay. And why did Zach Parkinson give you the flash drive? 
Because we have a lot of --we have the Joe Biden opposition book on that 
19 drive. And currently at the RNC, a lot of my work is similar doing opposition research 
20 against Joe Biden. 
21 Q Okay. So is it fair to say that --because Zach Parkinson is now the research 
22 director for the RNC, correct? 
23 
24 A 
Q Yes. 
So in his role as your supervisor in your current job, he gave you a flash drive 
25 of work product that was done while both of you were working for the Trump campaign.  1 Is that accurate? 
2 
3 A 
Q Yes. 
And you looked at that flash drive and then you pulled information --or 
4 between you and your lawyer, the information that was responsive to our document 
5 request, and those are the documents that we have. Is that fair? 
6 
7 A 
Q Yes. 
Did you, yourself, look through the documents you produced to us before 
8 they were produced? 
9 A I did not open them. I just looked at the names of them, and I thought if 
10 they were relevant, I just passed them along. 
11 
12 Q Okay. That's all very helpful. 
We're going to go through some of those documents. I want to get a sense of 
13 what you can remember working on yourself versus if you know what other people 
14 worked on, and we can just try to parse that out a bit. 
15 But very broadly, I want to walk through your understanding of how this --call it 
16 dead voting project, what the conclusion of that project was. 20 
17 When you were done --you did your work --how many names would you say that 
18 you were responsible for versus others? 
19 
20 A 
Q I don't remember. 
Was it more in the realm of --you know, 10 names that you think you looked 
21 up? Five names? 
22 
23 A 
Q I don't remember. 
Okay. And then when you did your research, you provided that to Zach 
24 Parkinson. Was that in memo form? 
25 A I don't remember. I'm sorry.  21 
1 
2 Q 
A How would you generally provide your findings to Zach Parkinson? 
Sometimes it was in Word documents. Sometimes it would just be through 
3 a body of an email. 
4 Q Okay. And after you provided --do you recall generally whether you --your 
5 research --in your research you concluded that dead people had voted? 
6 
7 A 
Q We found a few dead voters, yes. 
And were you aware of just what you did or were you aware of the 
8 compilation of the research team's efforts as to overall, like, here's what the research 
9 team found? 
10 A I was just aware of my own efforts. I wasn't really paying attention to what 
11 other people were doing. 
12 Q So were the memos that we'll look at in a minute that were on this flash 
13 drive, were those memos compilations of everyone's work or did everyone write their 
14 own memo? 
15 
16 A 
Q 
17 document? 
18 A That should be a compilation of everyone's work. 
So what was the process by which you all combined your work into a 
On Microsoft Word, you can make things into like a SharePoint, where 
19 multiple people can be editing at once. It's kind of like a live Google doc, but instead it's 
20 through Microsoft. So we all just all crashed the document. 
21 Q Do you recall, after sending this work product up to Zach, do you recall any 
22 feedback coming as to your work, whether either that you were accurate in your findings 
23 or inaccurate in your findings? 
24 
25 A 
Q I don't remember any feedback whatsoever. 
Okay. So let's just wrap up about how we --what you did. So you would  22 
1 go to newspapers.com, Lexis, Google. 
2 So if you had a name and if you could find an obituary that said John Doe died, 
3 and you --tell us how many --what are the number of data points you needed to say I 
4 now feel confident it's the same person? 
5 A I'm not sure how many data points, but, typically, in obituaries they'll say like 
6 a spouse or children that are left behind, and then a city or town where they're from, 
7 things like that that match up. 
8 
9 Q 
A 
10 believe so. 
11 Q Did you ever use Social Security numbers or have access to that kind of data? 
I believe we were. I believe that's on the spreadsheet we were given. 
Were you ever told --were you ever told that any individuals that you had 
12 said were dead voters were not dead voters after further review? 
13 
14 A 
Q I was not ever given feedback that way, that I recall. 
Okay. When you were deciding --when you were researching, did Zach 
15 Parkinson give you parameters of what would be sufficient information to say someone 
16 had, in fact, voted who was dead? 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 A 
Q He might have, but I don't remember now. 
Okay. I'm going to show you what is marked in your production as JK44. 
So here, is this a document that you've seen before? 
A 
Q Yes. 
Okay. So here when it says confirmed dead voters, is it fair to say that this 
22 is the research team providing this information to Zach Parkinson saying that these are 
23 individuals that have been confirmed to be dead voters? 
24 
25 A 
Q Yes. 
And so if we scroll down just slightly here --and I'm just going to kind of walk  23 
1 through so we see how this works. It's saying here that you found this individual. This 
2 is the proof that he's dead, right? That's the first thing you try to find is that this person 
3 that's claimed to be dead is, in fact, dead, and you do that by looking at obituaries, 
4 correct? 
5 
6 A 
Q Yes. 
And then if we scroll to the bottom of this page, it says, Blalock is registered 
7 as an unaffiliated voter according to GOP data center. 
8 Were you all given directives as to look into someone's political affiliation for the 
9 purpose of this list? 
10 A So I never had a login to GOP data center when I worked on the campaign, 
11 so that wouldn't have been me. 
12 Q Meaning, would someone else have done it for you if you --for someone, or 
13 that you just know that that is not your research work then? 
14 A I just know it wasn't me. It might have been another researcher who had a 
15 login. But I never had a login, so I don't know. 
16 Q Okay. So if we scroll to the next page here, it then has his voter info and 
17 has his registration date as 1996. So just to understand how to read these, it looks like 
18 these seem just to be noting the person has passed away, not that they voted. 
19 Were you all relying on whether they had voted to come from Zach Parkinson, or 
20 how were you noting that this was the same person? 
21 
22 A 
Q I didn't do that part, so I don't know. 
So if you could, if you could walk us through more detail. A lot of these 
23 look in this confirmed section as a compilation of proof of death, and I'm trying to get a 
24 sense of how you all are marrying the proof of death --like, with this example here, is 
25 there something I'm missing, is what I'm honestly trying to ask, of how this notes this  24 
1 person was, in fact, a dead voter? 
2 A I can only speak to the obituaries and if it matched up with the name. That 
3 was kind of my only role there. 
4 Q Okay. So you're given a name by Zach Parkinson, and is your job basically 
5 to confirm that someone by that name has died? 
6 A That --hopefully that person, not just anyone with that name, but that exact 
7 name that matches with the other information we were provided on the spreadsheet. 
8 Q And when you say the other information --and we can pull up one of these 
9 spreadsheets. I can show this to you in a minute, but I'm going to read to you --we'll 
10 look at this in a minute. I think this is what you're talking about, about James Blalock. 
11 It says --it has his year of birth and a date of birth and a registration date for his 
12 voter registration. So is that the kind of information you would look at from Zach 
13 Parkinson's spreadsheet, and if you found that in this information here, that that would 
14 be enough to say that it's the same person? 
15 A Yes, but I didn't have access to GOP data center, so I couldn't see the voter 
16 information from our side as to the registered --like, the voter registration. I could only 
17 see it from, like, the one side. So I only did half the project, so I don't --I also don't 
18 know how it all matches up. I can't speak to that. 
19 Q So who did the other half of the project? 
20 
21 A 
Q I don't know. 
To be clear, what you did was confirmed the person had died. But whether 
22 or not they were the same person who had voted, how would you do that? 
23 A So --sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you. 
24 So we were given that spreadsheet with the information such as the date of birth 
25 and their name, and I believe maybe a Social Security number there, and then you can  25 
1 pull that information up on Nexis and you can get more information about the person 
2 from there, such as their spouses, children, and then places they've lived, things like that. 
3 And then, with that information, if that matched up to the obituary, making sure it was 
4 the same person as that person that was provided on the spreadsheet with that Social 
5 Security number and date of birth. So I was more so matching up the obituaries with 
6 the Excel sheet. 
7 Q Okay. And tell me if I'm missing something, but in deciding whether 
8 someone's a dead voter, it seems like you have to find out three things: One is that, did 
9 someone, in fact, vote, right? Because there's got to be a vote for it to be voter fraud; 
10 did someone, in fact, die, is there truly a dead person out there somewhere; and the third 
11 thing is like, is the person in point one who voted, that information at least, is that the 
12 same information and match of the same person who died, and that's how you'd be able 
13 to confirm and deny whether there was a dead voter. 
14 So here, it sounds like --first of all, is that fair to say, like, the whole entire 
15 process, that would be how one would confirm whether there was a dead voter? 
16 
17 A 
Q Yes. 
And then for your process, you were confirming, it sounds like, whether this 
18 person --there's, in fact, a dead person, hence the benefit of having an obituary --that 
19 people write obituaries of people who have, in fact, died. Is that fair? 
20 
21 A 
Q Yes. 
Now, how did the other process happen? Meaning, how was there the 
22 proving of that death --one, that someone, in fact, voted, that point one I made, and 
23 point three, that the voting person and the dead person, that those are, in fact, the same 
24 person? How was that happening? 
25 A I believe that we matched up the person's name next --Social Security  26 
1 number and their date of birth and their voter registration date got matched up with the 
2 obituary where we could find out personal identification information about them. And 
3 that's as far as I know those two things got matched up. I can't speak to it any further 
4 because I'm not aware of anything else there. 
5 Q Okay. So you would look up the voter --if the voter registration 
6 information matched what? 
7 Like, that's what I'm trying to understand, is that, what is the data you're looking 
8 at for the present day to match old data? I'm trying to get a sense of how you're 
9 proving this person voted in a way that matters for this election as opposed to proving 
10 this person is just dead. 
11 Mr. Passantino. But I think what she's saying is she didn't do that part of it. So 
12 you're asking her --at least if I understand the question, you can tell me if I'm wrong. 
13 think she's saying she doesn't know on that side, unless I misunderstood your question. 
14 ~ That's helpful. So I understood her to say she only 
15 did --she didn't have access to the GOP --is it called the GOP center or something like 
16 that, I believe. 
17 BY 
18 Q So is it right that you were only doing the proof of death, or were you doing 
19 more than that? That's what I'm trying to clarify. 
20 
21 
22 A 
Q Proof of death. 
Okay. So you prove someone --Alex --excuse me. 
Zach Parkinson sends you a list of dead people they think voted. You go, you 
23 find the obituary, you confirm this person looks dead, date of birth matches, whatever, 
24 we got a dead person. 
25 What's next? Whether --who do you pass the information to?  27 
1 A So we put it in a SharePoint, and then our deputy, Dean Cleary, I believe, he 
2 just passed it back to Zach Parkinson, but I'm not sure. Can't speak to that for sure. 
3 Q But here's what I'm not understanding. It appears that confirming 
4 someone as dead doesn't seem to move the ball too far forward as to confirming whether 
5 a dead person voted. So it seems like there's a piece missing. I'm trying to understand 
6 what involvement you had or who else would have been involved in finding that missing 
7 piece. 
8 Because if you have an obituary match a name on a spreadsheet, as I understand 
9 it, it's a little bit of so what, lots of people are dead. But the point is to say, did that 
10 person in fact --is that the same person who voted? So here, for example --and we can 
11 scroll through it in a minute --lots of these information have voter info included, which to 
12 me seems critical to marry the dead voter with the voter. 
13 So what I'm trying to understand is that, if you didn't do that, then who did do 
14 that? Or if you did that, how did you do it? 
15 A I did not do that, and I don't know who did that. 
16 Q So when you would --for example, when you found matches, is it fair to say 
17 that you then were not confirming that someone was a dead voter; you were confirming 
18 merely that they died? 
19 A I --when I was given the spreadsheet, I just assumed they were a voter, that 
20 person had voted. But I don't know for sure where that spreadsheet came from, so I 
21 don't know. 
22 Q Okay. So --okay. That's helpful. 
23 In your analysis, you presumed that the people who were on that list had, in fact, 
24 voted, and if you could match that spreadsheet's identifiers with an obituary, that 
25 was --from that, you would say that you confirmed that there was a dead voter?  28 
A Yes. 1 
2 Q Okay. And the way you would do that, as you noted, was Google, Lexis, or 
3 newspapers.com? 
4 
5 A Yes. 
Q Okay. So if we pull back up --if we pull back up JK45. 
6 While that's coming up, do you recall in this exercise that there were dead people 
7 that you did not confirm, that you personally --like, I see a list up here about 
8 unconfirmed. There's a confirmed list, which we're looking at, and there were 
9 unconfirmed. 
10 Do you remember times where you did this work and you didn't confirm what was 
11 asked of you? 
12 
13 
14 
15 A Yes. 
Q Okay. And would it just be that the identifiers didn't match? Is that fair? 
A Yeah. We weren't able to even find an obituary that existed. 
Q Okay. So here --and do you remember the name, the first name we talked 
16 about, James Blalock? Is that a name that rings a bell to you? 
17 
18 
19 you? 
20 
21 A No. 
Q This name here, Deborah Christiansen, is that a name that rings a bell to 
A No. 
Q Okay. And then another --we can go to the next page here. It notes 
22 Deborah Christiansen, Jean Christiansen. And then it has voter info. And if we look at 
23 what's on JK48, we see the name Linda Kessler. Is that a name that --on this confirm list 
24 that you recall by any chance? 
25 A No.  29 
1 Q Okay. Now, in this same document you provided, these were Georgia 
2 voters that you provided. And then later on, there are names provided for Pennsylvania 
3 voters. Do you recall that? 
4 A I don't. I can't speak to that. I'm sure we were given a list of Pennsylvania 
5 voters, but not positive. I don't know. 
6 Q Uh-huh. Do you know --we can take the exhibit down. 
7 Do you have any knowledge that the intention of having --of discovering these 
8 dead people voting potentially was in order to make that public and to support that there 
9 might have been voter fraud in the election? 
10 A I'm not aware of what the intentions were with that document. I was just 
11 asked to put things together. 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Did you have an understanding what it would be used for? 
No. 
Did you have any discussions with anyone about what it would be used for? 
No. 
Are you aware that some of the names that you, in fact, put out that you 
17 gave to Mr. Parkinson, you and your team, the research team --I don't want to, you 
18 know, put it on you --but the research team, that those names were, in fact, published to 
19 the media? Do you have any knowledge of that? 
20 A I knew that after the fact, after it was published, but I didn't know that was 
21 the intention. 
22 
23 
24 
25 Q 
A 
Q 
A Tell me about when you found out they had been published to the media. 
Yeah. I don't know. What do you want me to say? 
How did you find that out? 
Through Twitter.  30 
1 Q I mean --yeah, just if you could explain. Like, did someone tell you on your 
2 team that they were published or did you see it for yourself? 
3 
4 
5 
6 A 
Q 
A 
Q I can't say for sure, but I'm pretty positive I just saw it on Twitter. 
Okay. And this is in the post-election period, in like November 2020? 
Uh-huh. Yes. 
Okay. So you came across that these names --and is it fair to say, even 
7 though you don't recognize the names now, that you recognized the names that were 
8 published as the work that you had contributed to at that time? 
9 A I can't even say I read that entire article like when it came out. It was just 
10 something that happened, but I don't think I even read the whole article. 
11 
12 Q 
A How did you know it was your work? 
I don't even know if it was my work. I'm sure it was someone's work on my 
13 team because we were working on that project in general. 
14 Q Now, the names are --end up publishing --I can --I mean, the names end up 
15 going out are overall one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight names, I think, in the first 
16 bunch with Georgia and Pennsylvania. So it's not a lot of names. 
17 So when you received this article, are you saying you don't recall whether you 
18 knew these had anything to do with the work you'd done? 
19 A Yeah. I honestly didn't. I didn't even do that much of this project. I did 
20 some of it. But, again, there was so many names, so many projects, that it was just 
21 another mundane task. It wasn't anything that stood out to me. 
22 Q When you say so many names, you mean so many names with regard to the 
23 dead people voting or so many names regard to something else? 
24 A The dead voters that we know confirmed, whether they did --they were or 
25 were not alive, we were given a list of names.  31 
And how many names do you recall, about? 1 
2 Q 
A I don't know. Were there like 20 on that spreadsheet maybe? That's just 
3 a wild guess. 
4 Q Okay. So when the names went back --went out to this Twitter thing you 
5 might have seen, did you end up having discussions with individuals on the campaign that 
6 there was media push back that some of these dead people were, in fact, not dead 
7 voters? 
8 
9 A 
Q I don't believe I had any conversations about it. 
Were you ever asked to confirm any of the work that was put out by the 
10 research team regarding to dead voters, after it had been published? 
11 
12 A 
Q I don't believe so. 
Are you aware that the Linda Kessler that was noted here in --as a 
13 confirmed dead voter was, in fact, the wrong person, that there was a Linda with a "V" 
14 versus a Linda with an "I"? Are you aware of that? 
15 
16 A 
Q No, I'm not aware of that. 
We looked at James Blalock here, who had passed away. Are you aware 
17 that that voter was, in fact --that Mr. Blalock had not voted, and it was, in fact, his wife, 
18 who went under the name Mrs. James Blalock, was the voter? 
19 A I was not aware of that, no. 
20 Q Did you have discussions with anyone on your team --well, let me ask you 
21 this way: Were you aware about statements that President Trump had made that 
22 thousands of votes were cast for Joe Biden in the name of dead people? 
23 
24 A 
Q I believe that statement was made, but I don't recall exactly. 
When you say you don't recall exactly, does that --you recall it was 
25 made --you recall it generally but not --or tell me --unpack a bit about what you recall  32 
1 there. 
2 A President Trump made lots of statements at that time; I can't remember 
3 every word that he said. Sounds like something he might have said. 
4 Q Well, I'm not asking you to remember every word. I'm asking, you did a 
5 research team for his campaign. He made very public statements repeatedly that 
6 thousands of dead people had voted. 
7 In November of 2020, were you aware, when you were researching whether dead 
8 people had voted, that the candidate had made statements on that very issue? 
9 
10 A 
Q I'm sure he had, but I don't remember exactly what he said. 
I'm not asking you whether you're sure he had. I'm asking you 
11 whether --and if the answer is you don't recall, that's all right. 
12 I'm asking whether you recall at that time that he was making public statements 
13 that thousands of dead people voted for Joe Biden? 
14 A I remember he was making public statements about dead voters, but I can't 
15 speak to the number or the exact quote. 
16 Q Do you recall statements by Rudy Giuliani around this time of your research 
17 also that thousands of dead people had voted for Joe Biden? 
18 A Again, I remember hearing him speak about how dead voters had voted, but 
19 I can't speak to the specific number, the exact quote he said. 
20 Q Are you aware of any research conducted by the Trump campaign's research 
21 team that offered any support for President Trump's claims that thousands of 
22 people --thousands of dead people had voted for President Biden? 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A We found a few people. We didn't find thousands. 
You found a few people who had voted for Vice President Biden? 
I don't know who they voted for. We were just looking at dead voters.  33 
1 can't speak to who they voted for. 
2 Q So is it fair to say that --so I'm going to ask you again. Did you find any 
3 evidence to support President Trump's statement that thousands of people had voted for 
4 Joe Biden in the names of dead people? 
5 A We found a few voters who voted that were dead, but not thousands. We 
6 don't specifically know if it was for Joe Biden. 
7 Q Now, the multiple mentions I just told you about the media actually 
8 disproving your claims about dead people voting, you weren't aware of those, though, 
9 right? 
10 
11 A I was not aware of those, no. 
Mr. Passantino. And I know you're not trying to be argumentative, but she 
12 wasn't making those claims. When you say that --these are not her claims. She's 
13 being very clear in what she did and what she didn't do. And maybe you didn't intend 
14 for it to come off, but it wasn't her claims that she was making. And I know you're not 
15 trying to be argumentative. I just want to make sure we're just talking about the facts 
16 she testified to. 
17 BY 
18 Q Well, as I understand it, the facts are that the research team was tasked with 
19 identifying whether people on the Zach Parkinson spreadsheet who were thought to be 
20 deceased were, in fact, deceased people who had voted, and that the research team put 
21 together a list of individuals with a title confirmed --I believe it was confirmed dead 
22 voters as a result --as work product for that effort. 
23 Ma'am, is that accurate what I just said? 
24 
25 A 
Q Can you say that again? 
The document I showed you that said --I believe the title was confirmed  1 dead voters, that was the result of your team's efforts to identify dead people who had 
2 voted, as asked to do by Zach Parkinson. Is that fair? 
3 
4 A 
Q Yes. 
And then to the extent that those individuals on that list were later proven 
5 to not have been dead voters, that would have been a mistake by the campaign's 
6 research team. Is that fair? 
7 A Yes. 34  35 
1 
2 [2:12 p.m.] 
3 BY 
4 Q I want to talk a bit about what other efforts regarding fraud-related research 
5 that you might've engaged in. Can you walk us through a bit what else you did in 
6 November 2020 separate from the dead people voting issue? 
7 A I don't remember for sure, but the media has refreshed my memory that I 
8 worked on a Dominion memo. I know that I did that. I know that I did some work for 
9 Victoria Toensing at one point. But I truly don't remember. It was long hours, and I 
10 was pretty tired post-election, so a lot of that I just had kind of pushed out of my brain, 
11 like, I don't remember it anymore. 
12 
13 
14 Q 
A 
Q When you say pushed out of your brain, was it not an enjoyable experience? 
I was tired. 
Let's start with Dominion. Who asked you to do a research related to 
15 Dominion Voting Systems? 
16 
17 A 
Q Zach Parkinson. 
And what did he ask of you and --you and with anyone --and if anyone else 
18 was included, can you tell us who else? 
19 A I believe it was Dean Cleary and Matt VanHyfte. I don't think anyone else 
20 was involved in that. We were given a list of claims to either substantiate or debunk, 
21 trying to figure out what was safe to say and what had no basis in reality. 
22 
23 
24 Q 
A 
Q And generally speaking, what was the result of your --of your efforts? 
Yeah, we put together a memo that we gave back to Zach Parkinson. 
Is it fair to say that you recall debunking a lot of the circulated claims that 
25 were made, or conspiracies, regarding Dominion Voting Systems?  1 
2 
3 
4 A 
Q 
A 
Q Yes. I believe we debunked a lot of them. 
Did Zach Parkinson tell you what he did with that memo? 
No. 
Do you recall getting any feedback from Zach Parkinson or anyone else 
5 regarding your Dominion memo? 
6 
7 A 
Q No. 
Do you recall any other discussions you had with anyone about public 36 
8 statements made by individuals associated with the campaign regarding Dominion? So 
9 I'm thinking Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, or anyone else. Did you have discussions 
10 about their continued use --or continued claims regarding Dominion Voting Systems? 
11 A I don't believe so. We were asked to put together this memo, but that 
12 didn't mean it made it to them or that they saw it or that we could control what they said, 
13 so --
14 Q And I'm not suggesting that. I ask these questions to understand, you 
15 know --for the record, it's important to also know what you did know and what you 
16 didn't know and what you did, you know. So I understand some of these questions may 
17 seem like an obvious, like, well, of course, I wouldn't know that, but it's important just to 
18 carve out for an accurate record. So if you could just bear with us on that front. 
19 Let's talk a bit about, in addition to Dominion, what other research --you 
20 mentioned a second research possibility, I think, that you engaged in. 
21 A We did stuff with Smartmatic, but that was in the Dominion memo. At one 
22 point, Victoria Toensing needed some help. She needed like a personal researcher, so 
23 she emailed me with a project. I believe it was just one. It might've been more than 
24 one, but I can't remember. 
25 Q And who did you understand her to be?  1 
2 A 
Q She was maybe a lawyer for the campaign. I don't know. 
Did you understand her to work with anyone like Rudy Giuliani or anyone 
3 else or be associated with? 
4 
5 A 
Q I can make assumptions, but I never really bothered to figure it out. 
If you were going to make an assumption, can you tell us what the 
6 assumption is and what would it be based on? 37 
7 A Well, Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell were heading up the election integrity 
8 front at that time, so I just assumed, if I was working on election integrity projects with 
9 Victoria, that she was tied into that. 
10 
11 Q 
A So tell us a bit about what you did for her. 
I only remember one thing that I did specifically for her. There might've 
12 been other things, but I don't have access to my, like, email account and so I can't refresh 
13 my memory. I really don't remember. 
14 But the one thing I remember was she --I think it was in Philadelphia, 
15 Pennsylvania --she asked me to look into --I guess at the time there was an issue with 
16 poll watchers in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and she asked me what nonzero meant. 
17 guess one of our lawyers said there was a nonzero amount of poll watchers, and I told her 
18 nonzero meant more than one. And then she disagreed with me, so then I just didn't 
19 answer her after that. 
20 
21 
22 
23 Q 
A 
Q 
A You said she disagreed with you? 
Uh-huh. 
What did she say back? 
She thought that the stenographer got it wrong, and that it was none, slash, 
24 zero poll watchers. 
25 Q Any other examples of research that you did for her?  38 
1 A I think she emailed me some questions at one point that I responded to, but 
2 I don't have my email account, so I don't even know what they would be in regards to. 
3 can't remember. 
4 Q So is it fair to say that in doing any research that you did for Victoria, that 
5 you did not find any evidence of fraud? 
6 
7 A 
Q Yes, that's correct. 
And is it fair to say that when you did research related to Dominion Voting 
8 Systems, you did not find any evidence of fraud? 
9 
10 A 
Q Yes. No instances of fraud. 
And when you did research and when you took in calls on the voter fraud 
11 line, you did not get any evidence of fraud from that either. Is that correct? 
12 A I wouldn't be able to speak to that. 
13 Q And that's because any evidence, any fraud links, any possible fraud you 
14 passed up the chain, so you wouldn't know what happened to it. Is that fair? 
15 
16 A 
Q Yes. 
So is it fair to say that you didn't get any feedback indicating that the voter 
17 fraud line had been successful in finding any fraud? 
18 
19 A 
Q We didn't get any feedback whatsoever. 
So it would be fair to say you got no feedback about any fraud found through 
20 the voter line then. Is that correct? 
21 
22 A 
Q Yes. 
Any other research efforts that you recall regarding the fraud post-election 
23 that you were engaged in, besides what we've spoken about? 
24 
25 A 
Q Nothing else that I can recall. 
What about research concerning Pennsylvania primary versus the amount of  39 
1 votes in Pennsylvania, regarding the number of ballots? Do you recall anything about 
2 that? 
3 A I do not recall anything about that. Potentially I worked on a project with 
4 that, but I don't remember. 
5 Q And that's all right. I know it's been some time. 
6 I'm going to show you a document that's been marked as exhibit 15, and it's a 
7 November 29th email from you to Jason Miller, copying Zach Parkinson. 
8 And what happens in --I'll show you what's page 3 of this document to refresh 
9 your recollection. It's an email from a reporter at the Associated Press, saying to Tim 
10 Murtaugh that they're fact-checking something spreading on social media about a social 
11 media post that claims that Pennsylvania counted more than 2.5 mailed ballots but only 
12 mailed out 1.8 million ballots to Pennsylvania voters. This repeats a statistic stated by 
13 Rudy Giuliani at the November 25th hearing in Harrisburg. 
14 And it has a quotation there, I believe that's supposed to be from Rudy Giuliani, 
15 saying that this is part of the --now, this is the part that is a mystery. Mailed ballots 
16 sent out, 1,823,148, but when you go to the count of the final count of the vote, there 
17 were 2,589,242 mail-in ballots. What happened? How do you account for the 700,000 
18 mail-in ballots that appeared from nowhere? 
19 And he said that was a quote from Rudy Giuliani at the November 25th hearing. 
20 Do you recall doing research regarding this issue? 
21 
22 A 
Q Yes. This definitely has reminded me of this. 
Okay. And you see at the top of this is an email from Jenna Ellis that says 
23 that that data was from the PA secretary of state's website that was pulled down on the 
24 date of the hearing. Mr. Murtaugh says, can anyone substantiate that? 
25 And then Jason Miller says, Jenna, should we send them this?  40 
1 And then at the bottom of page 1, Jason Miller emails you and says, Assuming 
2 Victoria does not have something urgent on your plate, the mayor read from, and I 
3 believe distributed, the below flyer at the PA hearing last week, leading to an inquiry from 
4 the AP. Are we able to prove any of these claims? And he has "any" in all caps. Our 
5 substantiation is pretty thin, and nobody can seem to remember who did the initial 
6 tabulations here. 
7 Now, did Jason Miller often send you assignments directly? 
8 
9 A 
Q No. 
So was this then, like, was it noteworthy that Jason Miller was sending you 
10 an assignment directly? 
11 
12 A 
Q Yes. 
So here, it's --were you, at this point --this is November 29th. Did you 
13 have an understanding as to whether Rudy Giulian i's team had --there was difficulty 
14 substantiating the claims they were making publicly? Was that something that you 
15 were aware of? 
16 
17 A 
Q I don't know where Rudy Giuliani was getting his information from. 
But I'm asking, here, Mr. Miller sends you an email directly. He's aware 
18 that you've been working with Victoria, like you just told us. He doesn't give you an 
19 introduction or otherwise say like this is coming out of the blue. So it leads me to 
20 believe that you all had some kind of prior work relationship. Is that fair? 
21 
22 A 
Q No, we did not have any prior work relationship. 
Okay. So as you recall, this would be --is this the first email you recall 
23 Mr. Miller sending to you directly, one-on-one? 
24 
25 A 
Q Most likely, yes. 
Okay. Had you otherwise provided work or research that you knew he was  41 
1 involved in reviewing that he would know who you are? 
2 A I believe post-election, Victoria needed someone, a researcher, and so I was 
3 like the go-to election integrity person. So I assumed Zach just made Jason aware, but 
4 I'm not positive how Jason knew I was that person. 
5 Q Okay. Now, when he writes here, are we able to prove any of these claims, 
6 I tend to read that as he is --and obviously in the next sentence --that he thought it 
7 questionable that these claims were true. 
8 Are you aware of discussions internally, that you were aware of, and the research 
9 team, about difficulty substantiating claims made by Rudy Giuliani or anyone on his 
10 team? 
11 
12 A 
Q I believe, yes. 
Is that to say that folks on the research team believed that the claims they 
13 were making were often difficult or impossible to substantiate? 
14 
15 
16 A 
Q 
A Yes. 
And did those people who had those thoughts include Zach Parkinson? 
I can't speak to what Zach Parkinson thought. He never really read me in to 
17 his own thinking. 
18 Q So tell us who expressed to you that --tell us where you got your 
19 understanding from that it was difficult or sometimes near impossible to substantiate 
20 Rudy Giuliani's claims? 
21 A It would just kind of be joking around with my friends on the campaign, 
22 because some things that would be said were just, I guess, hard to believe that they 
23 would be true. 
24 Q And did you have any other discussions with anyone more senior than you at 
25 the campaign?  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q No. 
Did you have the discussions with your fellow research analysts? 
Yes. 
Who specifically? 
Matt VanHyfte and Dean Cleary. 
And both Matt and Dean both shared the view that these claims made by 
7 Rudy Giulian i's team were hard to believe or to prove. Is that fair? 
I believe so, but I can't say for sure what they believed. 
And tell us what specific claims were so hard to believe. 
I don't remember exactly. 42 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Do you remember any of the claims that you thought were hard to believe? 
I believe one of them was from that Dominion memo, something about the 
13 voting machines being tied to either Spain or Venezuela or something. 
14 Q Is it fair to say that all of the claims you found hard to believe were related 
15 to voter fraud? 
16 A Yes, because I believe that's the only thing that was being spoken about at 
17 the time. 
18 Q So would it be fair to say that you didn't find Mr. Giuliani credible, from your 
19 vantage point, as it came to voter fraud claims that you were aware of? 
20 
21 A 
Q Yes. 
And from the best of your --from your vantage point as best as you know, is 
22 it fair to say that Matt --VanHice? 
23 Hyfte. 
24 BY 
25 Q --VanHyfte had the same view as well?  1 
2 A I believe he did. 
Q And is it fair to say that you also believed that Dean Cleary had the same 43 
3 view as you regarding Mr. Giuliani and the lack of credibility with his voter fraud claims? 
4 
5 A 
Q I can't say for sure for Dean Cleary. Not sure. 
Did you ever become aware of any kind of these discussions --let me 
6 rephrase that. 
7 Did you have any insight into Jason Miller's views as to Mr. Giuliani? 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 A I do not have any insight there. 
Q And did you all have similar discussions regarding Sidney Powell? 
A With who? 
Q With Matt and Dean. 
A I believe we did. 
Q And did you all also find --well, let me start with you. Did you find Sidney 
14 Powell's claims regarding voter fraud to lack credibility? 
15 
16 A Yes. 
Q And in your discussions with Matt, did you also understand that he shared 
17 your view that Sidney Powell lacked credibility when it came to voter fraud claims? 
18 
19 A I believe he did. 
Q And with Dean Cleary, did you also understand, to the best of your ability, 
20 that he shared your view as it related to Sidney Powell and that her voter fraud claims 
21 lacked credibility? 
22 
23 A 
Q 
24 Powell? 
25 A I believe he did, but I can't say for sure. 
Did you have any insight into how Zach Parkinson thought about Sidney 
I had no insight.  1 Q We're going to scroll up on this document here, exhibit 15, which has your 
2 response. 
3 And here, you explain that what appears to have happened was that someone 
4 cited numbers on this flyer from the 2020 PA primary election and not the general 
5 election. And then you go on to explain why that mistake would lead to confusion. 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 Do you recall sending this response? 
A 
Q 
A 
Q I do now, yes. 
Do you recall getting any feedback from this response? 
I do not recall. 
So this email here is November 29th of 2020. We've talked about 
11 Dominion Voting. We've talked about dead people. We've talked about a research 
12 assignment that you did for --what's Victoria's last name? I'm sorry. I'm blanking. 
13 A I think it's Toensing. I might spell it wrong, but I think it's T-o-e-n-s-i-n-g? 
14 Might've switched a few letters there. 44 
15 Q We talked about the discreet assignment you did for her and then the voter 
16 fraud line. Anything else that you remember doing research for post-election besides 
17 what I've just named? 
18 
19 A 
Q Nothing else that I remember. 
How about any opposition research related to individuals who made claims 
20 opposing President Trump's fraud claims? So, for example, the Arizona attorney 
21 general, Mark Brnovich. Do you remember doing any research related to him? 
22 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A 
Q I think we might've done a project with that. 
And the Arizona secretary of state, Katie Hobbs? 
Yes. 
What do you remember about those research assignments?  45 
1 A I truly don't remember much. I think we were just trying to make them 
2 maybe far left Democrats, but, like, I don't know for sure. There were so many projects, 
3 like, only guessing here. 
4 Q I'm going to show you what's been marked as exhibit 16. And I'm happy to 
5 show you the whole thread, but I'm going to try to, just for the purposes of time, try to 
6 get to the point. I'll give you some back story. 
7 Here, what this thread shows is Bill Stepien sending Tim Murtaugh and others an 
8 email, saying, Can your team do a research on the Arizona attorney general? 
9 And then Mr. Parkinson responds with various comments, but he tells Tim 
10 Murtaugh that his team will pull this information together, and they --it looks like 
11 basically trying to find oppo research on two individuals who were not --who were 
12 pushing back against the presence of fraud in Arizona. 
13 Does that ring a bell as to what I'm talking about? 
14 A A little bit, yes. 
15 Q I'm going to show you what's on --when Zach Parkinson brings you in. 
16 On page 2 --let's go to page 2 of this document. 
17 You'll see at the bottom of page 2, there's talking points that show both where 
18 Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs has seemingly negative factors when it comes to 
19 election fraud and --for example, at the bottom, Arizona Attorney General Mark 
20 Brnovich, it notes that he refused to publicly back President Trump in the 2016 general 
21 election. 
22 Is it fair to say this is kind of generic oppo research that could be used? 
23 
24 
25 right? A 
Q Yes. 
And this is the kind of thing that the research team would do sometimes,  1 
2 A 
Q Yes. 
Now, if we scroll up on this page, we see that Mr. Murtaugh responds to 
3 Mr. Parkinson, and then on top of that, he then forwards it to you and Dean Cleary, 
4 where he says, Get me all statements that Brnovich has made on the election result, 
5 including Trump will win, include what he said saying it's over, anything we need for 
6 general awareness. 46 
7 
8 And then on the first page, Dean responds, On it. And you're still on the thread. 
Mr. Parkinson then says, Where are we? He says, I can send you what we have 
9 after I finish transcribing a video bullet. Will respond shortly. 
10 Dean Cleary attaches a doc. You're still copied. And then the rest we can move 
11 on from. 
12 So my question for you here is, do you remember being asked --were you ever 
13 asked to do any research as to whether, in fact, there was fraud in Arizona? 
14 A I don't think we specifically were looking into fraud in Arizona. I think we 
15 were just looking into Brnovich's statements, according to this email. 
16 Q So is it fair to say that you were asked not to use your time researching 
17 whether, in fact, fraud existed, but instead, to find oppo research against the two State 
18 officials who were saying that there wasn't fraud? 
19 A I don't even know in this case if it was opposition research. It might've just 
20 been general awareness, here's what this person has said. 
21 
22 Q 
A And tell us the difference between those two things. 
Opposition research is more so in trying to hit someone with information. 
23 General awareness is just getting all the information that they said, good and bad. 
24 
25 Q 
A And here, do you recall it being one or the other? 
I do not recall. But it appears from this email, that it was just general  1 awareness that Zach Parkinson was looking for. 
2 Q Besides the handful of dead people voting, were you ever asked to 
3 look --besides the dead people voting and Dominion-related issues, are you aware of, 
4 you or the research team, ever being asked to look into any other claims of fraud? 
5 
6 A 
Q I don't believe so. That --yeah, I don't remember. 
So it's fair to say that you aren't aware of any other --of you or any of your 
7 colleagues' research team being asked to find evidence of widespread voter fraud? 
8 
9 A 
Q 
10 correct? 
11 
12 A 
Q Yes. Nothing that I can remember. 
And you did, in fact, not find any evidence of widespread voter fraud, 
I did not. 
And you were not aware of anyone else on the research team finding 
13 evidence of any widespread voter fraud, correct? 
14 
15 A 
Q Correct. 
Now, I want to return just quickly, with regard to fundraising emails, you 
16 testified earlier that, post-election, you do not recall reviewing any fundraising emails. 
17 Is that correct? 47 
18 A Nothing that I can recall, but you guys have the emails, but I don't remember 
19 doing any of that. 
20 Q Do you recall anyone besides Zach Parkinson doing any research related to 
21 fundraising emails or texts? 
22 
23 A 
Q I'm not aware of if there were --anyone else did that. 
Do you recall doing any work related to messages that were sent over the 
24 Trump Campaign's phone app? 
25 A I --was that part of the fundraising emails? I'm not sure. I don't know  48 
1 what went where. 
2 Q Well, is there any work, do you remember, specifically that was, as you 
3 understood it, specifically for the Trump app? 
A I don't know what went where, so I don't know. 
Q Now, when did your contract end with the Trump Campaign? 4 
5 
6 A Technically, it ended December 15th, but that was an accident because I was 
7 supposed to get paid through the 30th. 
8 Q And so tell us --and we've seen the email regarding the payment issues. So 
9 tell us --it seems like those were resolved. Is that fair? 
10 
11 
12 
13 A Yes, that was resolved. 
Q So when did you end up working till? 
A The 30th. 
Q Okay. So tell us, the 30th comes, and are you done with the campaign 
14 after that? Do you do any work after the 30th? 
15 A I don't do any work after the 30th. 
16 Q Okay. So you leave on the 30th, you turn in your laptop, turn in your 
17 devices. And then, when January 6th comes, are you working for anyone else or are you 
18 just not working at all? 
19 A I think I was in between jobs. I didn't start at the Republican Governors 
20 Association till a few days later, I believe. I don't know what day I started at the RGA, 
21 but I know I was at home on January 6th, so --
22 
23 
24 Q And where was home? 
A That was in Arlington at the time. 
Q Okay. So let's go to the day. Did you watch the President's speech on the 
25 White House Ellipse that day?  49 
1 A No, I did not. 
2 Q Going into January 6th, did you have a view that there was widespread fraud 
3 in the 2020 election? 
4 
5 A 
Q No. 
Is it fair to say that you thought --that you believed the President's 
6 statements that there was widespread fraud were not true? 
7 
8 A 
Q Yes. 
Going to the day of the attack, January 6th, can you tell us where you were 
9 when you realized that there was an attack on the Capitol? 
10 A I was at home in my apartment in Arlington. I think I was just on my couch 
11 and on Twitter. I think maybe someone texted me, asking me, like, if I was okay, 
12 because they saw the news. And then I was like, what do you mean, I'm in Arlington, 
13 I'm not in D.C. That's all I recall. 
14 Q And then did you watch news coverage of the attack as it unfolded? 
15 A Yes. 
16 Q And what was your --tell us a bit about your response watching the attack. 
17 A I was just trying to understand what was happening then, while it was 
18 happening. Just kind of nothing really added up, and then --I don't know, it just made 
19 me sad, but --yeah. 
20 Q Looking back now, the President has made --and I just asked you another 
21 variation of this, but I want to ask you just again to be clear. 
22 The President has made a wide variety of claims from even prior to election day to 
23 post-election day regarding fraud in the election. And to be clear, I'm talking about the 
24 former President. 
25 President Trump has indicated that there was widespread fraud, a variety of ways  50 
1 and means that impacted the election. And it sounds --and I want to just get this 
2 correct, but it sounds like you, as the research team for the campaign, found zero 
3 evidence of that in line with what you looked at. Is that fair? 
Yes, that's fair. 4 
5 A 
Q During any of the time you did any of your research, were you aware of any 
6 efforts by anyone to make the President aware of the results of the research team's work 
7 on any of these issues? 
8 
9 A 
Q I don't know where information went. 
With regard to your testimony here today, have you discussed --outside of 
10 your lawyer, have you told other people that you're meeting with the select committee? 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 A 
Q 
A 
Q Yes. 
And who have you told? 
Basically, like, all my friends and everyone in the office. 
And have you discussed your testimony with anyone? 
Mr. Passantino. Other than me. 
Ms. Kotkiewicz: Oh. No. 
BY 
Q Okay. Have you discussed your testimony with anyone you worked with at 
19 the Trump Campaign? 
20 
21 A 
Q No. 
Have you spoken to Zach Parkinson at all in any capacity regarding you 
22 speaking to the select committee? 
23 A I told him I was speaking with the select committee, but we didn't discuss 
24 what he talked about. I know he also spoke with you guys, but we didn't discuss what 
25 he spoke about. And I --he gave me no direction, nothing like that. It was just more of  1 a, head's up, I'm going to be out of the office for this. 
Going back to January 6th, did you talk to Zach Parkinson that day? 
No. 51

4 Q 
A 
Q Have you talked --have you spoken to Zach Parkinson at any time regarding 
5 the events of January 6th? 
6 
7 A 
Q No. I don't think so, no. 
Have you spoken to Zach Parkinson at any time regarding his views of 
8 whether there was election fraud in 2020 that impacted the election? 
9 A No. Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you. No. 
10 
11 
12 Q 
A 
Q Okay. Did you speak to Dean Cleary about the events of the 6th? 
Maybe? 
What do you recall about maybe speaking to him? 
13 A I feel like, at the time, like, potentially maybe had a text conversation with 
14 him, like, whoa, did you see what was happening on TV. But that's about it. 
15 
16 
17 Q 
A 
Q What about Matt? 
Same thing as Dean. 
Did you have any conversations with any campaign staffers about your view 
18 as to the President's actions on January 6th? 
19 
20 
21 A 
Q 
A No. 
What were your views as to the President's actions on January 6th? 
I truly wish he would've spoken up to everyone who --that were headed to 
22 the Capitol. That's it. I wish he would've said something. 
23 
24 
25 Q 
A 
Q Has anyone offered to pay your attorney's fees? 
The RNC is paying for my attorney. 
And earlier when you said you wished the President had said something, you  1 said --is that you wish he had told the people at the Capitol to go home? 
2 
3 
4 A 
Q Yes. 
Is it fair to say you were disappointed that he didn't say anything? 
Mr. Passantino. I'm not --I mean, I don't mind you answering. It's kind of 
5 argumentative, what a 23-year-old thinks about the President should've done. I'm not 
6 sure the relevance. 
7 The only reason I'm raising this is because when testimony like this sort of leaks 52 
8 out, it becomes really damaging to young people who are just here to be honest and give 
9 you their views. And asking her subjective view about the propriety of the conduct of 
10 the President can only hurt her when you guys put this stuff out. 
11 And it's, candidly, the --it's the Congress' job to reach whatever conclusions and 
12 put that before the American public. And I'm really just trying to protect my client here, 
13 that asking her subjective questions about the President, when this stuff all leaks out, is 
14 just really harmful to someone who's trying to help serve the country and help you all. 
15 So I'd ask you to show some discretion in asking stuff that's not going to really 
16 advance the ball too much. 
17 Now, with that, I'm not instructing her not to answer. 
18 And I appreciate that, and all discretion will be used here. 
19 But, you know, I think your client is an incredibly relevant witness, because her and her 
20 team were responsible for researching the very claims made by the President. And even 
21 on the day, if I'm not mistaken, and my team can correct me, but even on the day of 
22 January 6th, the President made claims regarding dead people voting, the very claims 
23 that were researched by the team. 
24 So I think it's incredibly relevant to understand what the people the campaign 
25 tasked to research the very claims that were then expressed by the President before the  1 Capitol was attacked, and the views of the people who were at the forefront of 
2 researching those claims I think is relevant here. 
3 So I take all what you said, and I don't have a lot of questions on this point, but, 
4 you know. 
5 
6 Q So just to get back to the question. And you mentioned you wish he had 
7 said something. What do you wish he had said? 
Can I just say something else first? 
Yeah. 53 
8 
9 
10 A 
Q 
A Again, like, this is my first job out of college. I was a very low-level staffer. 
11 I was literally one of the least paid, like, people on the Trump Campaign. I was asked to 
12 do an assignment, and I did it, and I don't know where any of it went because I was so low 
13 level. So I just kind of want to put that on the record. 
14 Q And I think that is a very important thing, and that actually, I think, helps 
15 make a clearer record, that what was asked of you directly out of college, and for issues 
16 of incredible importance to the Nation, for someone who was quite young. So I think 
17 that is --that's an important thing to have on the record. 
18 So just to --back to my question. I wanted to circle back to what you said, what 
19 you wished the President had said. 
20 A Well, I think I answered that earlier. I wish he just would've told his 
21 supporters to go home. Like, I still love President Trump to this day, but I just wish 
22 everyone would've went home. 
23 Okay. If we could just take --let's take a 2-minute break, 
24 I think we'll be nearing the end. So if we could just take a 2-minute break, just give us a 
25 second to circle up, we'll be there. All right?  1 
2 
3 
4 Mr. Passantino. Okay. Sounds good. 
Okay. 
[Recess.] 
All right. I think that we've --that's the end here, 
5 hopefully. 
Ms. Kotkiewicz --did I say that? How do I say it? Kotkiewicz? 
Ms. Kotkiewicz. Kotkiewicz. 54 
6 
7 
8 Kotkiewicz. Kotkiewicz. I have a very long name, so I'm 
9 very sensitive to folks just --you know, I'm always like, it's just English letters, just say it 
10 correctly, but --
11 Thank you so much for taking out the time. I know this process is not easy to be 
12 a part of. And hopefully this --you know, we weren't here too long, so hopefully it 
13 wasn't too painful, but thank you for taking out the time. Thank you to your lawyer as 
14 well. 
15 Before we go, you obviously --you know the topics that we were interested in, 
16 you know what we've asked. Is there anything I haven't asked you that you think we 
17 should know or you want to say now before we end? 
18 
19 Ms. Kotkiewicz. No. 
Okay. All right. Unless someone has anything else, we 
20 will be in recess, subject to the call of the chair. 
21 [Whereupon, at 2:51 p.m., the interview was recessed, subject to the call of the 
22 chair.]  1
