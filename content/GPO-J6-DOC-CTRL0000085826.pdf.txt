Subject: Only two options 
Verified, audited results from properly counted, legal and timely ballots -Trump Wins 
Pelosi/ Schumer raw partisan political power rule -GOP legislatures elect to not send in electors 
from an unreliable and rigged system before all questionable conduct has been answered which 
means Biden does not receive 270 electoral votes, and consequently, the House voting by state 
delegations (26) elect the President -Trump wins. 
The only way Trump loses is rigged system (like the insurance policy of Russia collusion) and 
Republicans do not have the will to push back for the truth. This is coup 3.0 -Russian 
Collusion; Impeachment; and now Rigged Election.
