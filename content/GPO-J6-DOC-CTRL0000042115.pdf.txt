Senator, 
We are standing by to assist. You are doing great work. Truly appreciated. Let me know if you 
need anything in the interim. 
Warm regards, 
Katherine

Dear Katherine, 
We made good headway convincing (hopefully) two counties with dominion 
machines in PA... BUT, I'm still waiting final ok from each, but I am hopeful that 
we can have the analysis done on Wednesday (that's what I'm pressing them 
for). 
One county requested an official request -which I provided them. 
We do not have subpoena powers until 05 JAN (due to byzantine rules), so these 
counties are voluntary. 
The chair of the voting fraud committee promised to drop subpoenas next week 
on the less than cooperative counties. 
More to follow hopefully tomorrow. 
Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Mayor -here's what we came up with; ref last night's question. 
No surprise, but our PA Secretary of State is NOT responding to inquirers from 
the Senate.
