3 We will go on the record at 4:02 p.m. eastern time. 
Good afternoon. This a transcribed interview of Mr. Lewis Cantwell --I know he 
4 goes by "Easton" --conducted by the House Select Committee to Investigate the 
5 January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol pursuant to House Resolution 503. 
6 At this time, I'd ask the witness to please state your full name and spell your last 
7 name for the record. 
8 
9 Mr. Cantwell. Lewis Easton Cantwell, C-a-n-t-w-e-1-1. 
Thank you, Mr. Cantwell. 
10 This will be a staff-led interview, and members, of course, may also choose to ask 
11 questions. 
12 Speaking right now, I'm investigative counsel. There are no 
13 other committee members, staff, or congressional Members in the room today. 
14 At this time, could counsel please state their full name for the record? 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 Mr. Cocis. Sure. Nicolai Cocis. 
And can you spell your last name for us, Mr. Cocis? 
Mr. Cocis. It's C-o-c-i-s. 
Thank you. 
We have an official reporter transcribing the record for this interview. Please 3 
20 wait, Mr. Cantwell, until each question is completed before you begin your response, and 
21 I'll try to wait until your response is complete before I ask my next question. 
22 The stenographer cannot record nonverbal responses, such as shaking your head, 
23 so it's important that you answer each question with a verbal response. But if I see you 
24 shaking your head, I'll just annotate it for the record with a positive or a negative 
25 response for the record. So if you hear me saying that, that's why I'm doing it.  1 
2 Mr. Cantwell. Okay. 
And we ask that you provide complete answers based on your 
3 best recollection. If the question's not clear, just ask me to restate it, and I can try to 
4 clarify. If you don't know the answer to the question, please simply say so. 4 
5 First, it's important that you understand that this interview is voluntary. So, if at 
6 any time you would like to stop speaking with us, that's your choice. 
7 Similarly, if at any point you need to discuss something with your attorney in 
8 private, please let us know, and we'll take a break so you can have that conversation. 
9 Do you understand? 
10 Mr. Cantwell. Okay. 
11 Second, this interview is not under oath, but because this is a 
12 formal congressional investigation, you are obligated under Federal law to tell the truth, 
13 the same as if you were speaking with the FBI or DOJ. It is unlawful to deliberately 
14 provide false information to Congress. So, for this interview, providing false information 
15 could result in criminal penalties for false statements. 
16 So do you understand that as well? 
17 Mr. Cantwell. I do. 
18 You are not obligated to keep the fact of this interview and what 
19 we discussed confidential. You are free to tell whoever you want that you met with us, 
20 including the prosecutor or judge in your case, or you can tell no one at all. That's your 
21 decision. 
22 But it's important that you know that the select committee is separate and 
23 independent from the DOJ, that we have no involvement with your prosecutions, and the 
24 DOJ is not a partner to the committee in our investigation. 
25 The select committee also is not a party to your criminal case, is not agreeing to  5 
1 submit anything on your behalf to the judge, nor can we make any representations 
2 whether, if you tell the judge that you met with us, that the judge will be more favorable 
3 to you during sentencing. 
4 Do you understand that as well? 
5 Mr. Cantwell. I do. 
6 As Mr. Cocis had mentioned before we went on the record, we've 
7 agreed that we will not share the substance of what you say with DOJ prior to your 
8 sentencing. But there are two possible exceptions that you should be aware of. 
9 So if you tell us about evidence of a crime that we thought that law enforcement 
10 was unaware of or if we had reason to believe that you had lied to us during this 
11 interview, then we will be obligated to tell DOJ or another appropriate law enforcement 
12 agency. 
13 Or if you told the judge that you met with us, please understand that that may 
14 prompt questions from the judge about what you said and whether it is consistent with 
15 your prior statements and acceptance of responsibility. So if the judge starts asking 
16 questions, we may get asked to respond and divulge what you said. 
17 
18 
19 
20 But those are the exceptions. So is that clear as well? 
Mr. Cantwell. It is. 
Mr. Cocis, is that what you were talking about before? 
Mr. Cocis. Yeah, that's what I was talking about before. 
21 Okay. 
22 Logistically, please let us know if you need any breaks or would like to discuss 
23 anything with your attorney. 
24 There might be individuals who join later on. If they do, I'll make sure that I 
25 annotate it for the record and also let you know so that you're aware.  1 And, again, if you don't understand a question, please just ask me to repeat it, 
2 okay? 
3 
4 
5 
6 Mr. Cantwell. Okay. 
EXAMINATION 
BY 
Q All right. So, Mr. Cantwell, please tell us a little bit about yourself, like 
7 where you're from, where you live, your educational background. 
8 A I'm originally from Fernandina Beach, Florida, born in Jacksonville, Florida. 
9 I live in Canton, North Carolina, a small town outside of Asheville, North Carolina, in the 
10 Smokey Mountains. 
11 I graduated high school and went to college at the University of North Florida for 6 
12 roughly 2 years. And then I joined the military, and I stayed for another couple of years. 
13 And then I was discharged and worked a variety of jobs my whole life and moved around, 
14 so --and I'm here now. 
15 
16 in? 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A As a fellow veteran, thank you for your service. What branch did you serve 
The Army. 
You were discharged. What was the characterization of it? 
Other than honorable. 
Okay. So what do you do for a living now? 
I'm a network engineer. I work on fiber-optic networks for internet 
22 systems. So, like, I bring internet to businesses and homes and stuff, help design the 
23 systems behind them. 
24 Q What was your job while you were in the military? Was it also 
25 com ms-related?  1 A No, actually, it wasn't. I trained to be EOD. I actually started as an 
2 18-series and then ended up getting recycled, and while I was recycled, I ended up going 
3 to EOD school, and that's where I finished, with EOD. 
4 Q Gotcha. 
5 Other than your Army career and the fiber-optic-type work you're doing now, 
6 have you had any other careers? 
7 A I've been a chef in, you know, a high-capacity restaurant, fine dining, 500 
8 people in a 4-hour period. 
9 I've been the general manager of a trucking company that sold semi trucks and 
10 bought trucks all over the country. 
11 I've worked in construction. 
12 I have been a waiter. 
13 I've sold --not only did I run that company, but I used to sell motor homes and 
14 yachts and boats and stuff like that, too --
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 Q 
A Got it. 
--for official companies and stuff. And a variety of other things. 
Q Makes sense. 
Okay. Well, let's go, I guess, then, to the lead-up to January 6th. 
So, for these next questions, the timeframe we're thinking about is during former 
20 President Trump's Presidency. So it can be 2020, 2019. Just during the time period 
21 when he was President is what we're really thinking about here. 
22 So, in general, how would you have described your level of political engagement 
23 throughout former President Trump's term? 
24 I've always been very politically active. I study --like, I'm one of the few people 7 
25 who probably know all my politicians, my Congressmen, my Senators in my area. I keep  8 
1 very good track of everything to do with politics? 
2 I'm actually --just to note it, I'm not --I'm pretty much independent. I lean more 
3 conservative, but I have a ton of different values that I share on all sides of the political 
4 scheme, so I'm not really biased. Like, I voted for Obama. 
5 I owned a business that I started in 2018, and under that --which I didn't mention 
6 before, but I had a business for 3 years, a teahouse, that --I sold teas that helped 
7 people with, like, drug addiction and pain relief and all kinds of stuff, like headaches, 
8 sleep issues. And it was kind of a hang-out spot. 
9 And it did very well during his tenure as Presidency, I guess you could say, until 
10 COVID happened. And that really put a lot of strain on my business. And then, you 
11 know, that whole year of 2020 was just pretty chaotic, with everyone, you know, freaking 
12 out all over the place, like, just --
13 
14 
15 Q Right. 
A --riots and different things here and there. 
So I'd never been to a rally before that day or a political anything. I went to a 
16 vigil for George Floyd not long after he died, but that wasn't a rally. It was more of, like, 
17 a procession with candles with a bunch of people in a local small town where we just --
18 
19 Q 
A Right. 
--sat around a fountain. But I had never been to any, like, political rallies 
20 where there was political people there, you know. I followed them on social media and 
21 the news, and that's pretty much it. I was not very, like, locally politically active, you 
22 know --
Q 
A Right. 
--or anything like that. I voted and, you know, stuff like that. 23 
24 
25 Q Speaking of, you mentioned that you follow the news on social media.  1 guess, what channels or news stations do you rely on the most to get your news? 
2 
3 
4 A Then or now? 
Q Has it changed? 
A No. I was never, like --you know, a lot of those people that were at 
5 January 6th were, like, QAnon followers --
6 
7 Q 
A 
8 anything. Right. 
--or Q followers. That's not me. I never even went to their website or 9 
9 But I generally usually watch, let's see, like, ABC. I listen to NPR while I'm driving 
10 in the car. And then I'll watch FOX too and OAN, which is One America News Network; 
11 CNN occasionally just because I like to, like, get a bounce off, back and forth. 
12 But generally what I do is I bounce around. I have an app that puts all different 
13 news together, and so, that way, I'm less likely to be biased by going to a site. I pick 
14 headlines that I am interested in reading, and then I go into that. But I could spend all 
15 day reading about science and stuff and never even read into politics. I spend a good 
16 deal reading a day, about 3 or 4 hours. 
17 Q Okay. 
18 And then, similarly, I understand the channels or the news sources, but what 
19 social media applications did you, if you used any, to --
20 A Well, at that time, I had a Twitter and a Facebook and a TikTok. And I had 
21 an lnstagram for my store, but I didn't use it, because I had the kids who, like, ran the 
22 store. Like, my managers and stuff, they managed that, so I didn't really go on there for 
23 anything, but --yeah. And I would just see posts on there, but --
24 
25 Q 
A Right. 
--I usually am the type that I cross-reference it, though. So I'm more of  10 
1 a --I'm more analytical, I guess you would say. 
Right. 2 
3 Q 
A So, if I see who wrote the article, then I'll kind of --I even like to look up who 
4 is writing the article and have they had any political biases in the past on this topic or on 
5 other topics that I'm, you know, into. That way, I can kind of devise whether it's being 
6 skewed in the wrong direction or not. 
7 
8 Q 
A Gotcha. 
I would say I spend a lot more time going into it than the average person, 
9 that's for sure. 
10 Q Got it. 
11 I forgot to ask earlier, did you rely on any, like, traditional print media, like The 
12 New York Times or Wall Street Journal or anything like that? 
13 A Yeah, but they have online things, so I don't get a subscription for them 
14 that --you know. And generally you have to --you have to pay for The Wall Street 
15 Journal to read their things, and so --but I work with the internet, so, you know, it's just a 
16 different letter at the end of that URL, and it changes so you don't have to pay to read 
17 them. Common knowledge on the internet, like, for people who do what I do. 
18 Q Yeah. 
19 I'm going to go through quite a few social media applications, and let me know if 
20 you used them in the time period, I would say, during former President Trump's 
21 Presidency or even in the lead-up to the election of 2020. 
22 So the first one is 4chan. 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A 4chan? 
Yep. 
No, I don't --I don't really --you mean, like, used their application?  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 Q Yeah, did you use their application? 
A No. I mean, I've seen 4chan, like, articles and stuff, but not --
Q Okay. 
A I've never been on their thing, no. 
Q What about 8kun? So 8, the number 8, k-u-n. 
A No. 
Q Okay. 
I know you already said Facebook, correct? 
A Yeah. 
Q Parler? 
A No, I don't use Parler. 
Q Reddit? 
A Yeah, I have --I have a Reddit. 
Q And when I say were you using this, I guess in that 2020 timeframe, were 
15 you using Reddit then? 
16 
17 
18 A Yeah. Yeah. 
Q Okay. 
A But I use Reddit for all kinds of stuff, mostly video game knowledge, 
19 honestly. 
Q That's fair. 11 
20 
21 A And Reddit's very, very skewed in one direction on some things, but you can 
22 go to specific posts, but --yeah. 
23 
24 
25 Q What about Snap? 
A No, I don't have Snapchat. I'm 37. 
Q Oh. That's fair.  12 
Telegram? 1 
2 A I had Telegram, but it was just, like, a texting app. I don't know about any 
3 social media stuff that's involved with it. As far as I know, I just had a Telegram, and it 
4 was, like, texting, just, like, a multimedia thing. 
5 Q Okay. So you weren't, like, in any channels or anything like that on 
6 Telegram? 
7 A No. I don't know enough about that. It's literally, one of my friends just 
8 told me that it was more secure communication. And so I downloaded it, along with 
9 Signal, which is one of the other ones. 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 Q Got it. 
You've mentioned TikTok and Twitter. You used both of those, correct? 
A Yeah, I didn't use TikTok until really after January 6th. 
Q Okay. 
What about Gettr, G-e-t-t-r? 
A No. 
Q YouTube? 
A Yeah. 
Q Okay. 
A But I don't go there for information. It's --I don't go there for political 
20 information. I really don't even use it anymore, honestly. But I do watch, like, 
21 YouTube documentaries and different stuff on there occasionally. 
22 
23 Q What's the type of documentaries? 
A Like, nature documentaries and stuff like that. There's all kinds of 
24 different --yeah, I mean, I'm very into all kinds of subjects, so history --I like to watch 
25 historical documentaries.  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 Q Got it. 
What about Discord? 
A 
Q Yeah, but that's for gaming. 
Okay. 
Did you go to the TheDonald.win? 
A No. I --no. Discord --like, our Discord channels --I used to run a server 
7 on a video game called Rust, and so I have a bunch of friends who play on there. And 13 
8 that's the easiest way to communicate across the world, because I have friends who are, 
9 like, all over the world that are in our, what they call a clan. But, anyways, yeah. 
10 That's what I use Discord for. 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 Q 
A 
Q Okay. So what about a separate site, TheDonald.win? 
No. I've never --I didn't know it existed. 
Okay. 
Gab, G-a-b? 
A No. Don't know what it is. 
Q 
A 
Q Wimkin, W-i-m-k-i-n? 
No. Don't know what it is. 
And if you had to pick one or a couple of these sites that I just went through, 
19 which source did you rely on the most for your news? 
20 A I wouldn't say I relied on any of those for news. That's a terrible way to 
21 rely on news, is from social media. I never relied on any social media for news. Like, 
22 I'm saying I saw news that was on social media, but that wasn't where I got my news 
23 from. 
24 Like I said, I use an app that breaks down all the news. And so that one 
25 particular app sends me different --from every different, you know, website, all, like,  1 Scientific America and also CNN and Wall Street Journal and FOX and, like --
2 Q Is this Apple News you're talking about? 
3 
4 
5 A 
Q 
A No, no. It's on my Android. It's, like --it's NewsBreak. 
Got it. 
And it basically compiles all these different --it gives me local news, tech, 
6 travel, science, all that, and so it just puts it all into one thing. 
7 
8 
9 Q Got it. 
Did you follow former President Trump on social media? 
Yes. 
What site did you follow him on? 
Twitter and Facebook. 14 
10 
11 
12 A 
Q 
A 
Q So, right after the general election in 2020, did you believe that the election 
13 was stolen from former President Trump? 
14 
15 
16 A 
Q 
A Yes. 
I guess, what made you believe that the election had been stolen? 
Well, at the time, it was videos mostly, people stuffing ballot boxes in 
17 Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Wisconsin, Georgia. And these are videos that come 
18 out within days of the election. 
19 So, by January 6th, we had had a variety of videos from all over. There was 
20 geocaching, phone-caching data that was used to analyze --it's just like the movie that's 
21 coming out in May, the "2,000 Mules." 
22 
23 Q 
A Yeah. I'm not tracking that movie. 
Yeah. Dinesh D'Souza --see, that's one of the things, is, like, it always 
24 seems like people in politics are about a month or a year behind everyone in the real 
25 world sometimes. And I know that sounds kind of crazy, but it really does, like --stuff  15 
1 that was released previously isn't getting re-released until later. 
2 I mean, Michael Sussmann and Hillary Clinton and them doing the investigations 
3 into Durham right now --with Durham right now. And, you know, those things are still 
4 coming out now, as we're sitting here. There's more and more things that keep coming 
5 out. And so it only reinvigorates everyone out there who still believes it. You know 
6 what I mean? 
7 Like, I don't think he's still the President. That's foolish, you know? Joe Biden is 
8 the President. 
9 
10 
11 Q 
A 
Q Do you still believe the election was stolen? 
I don't really know what to believe. 
Well, it sounds like you started to believe that the election was stolen very 
12 close to the election, if not, like, that night or days after. Is that correct? 
13 A Well, it's very strange whenever they deliver ballots in a truck in the middle 
14 of the night, at 3 o'clock in the morning, when that State's regulatory laws say at 8 o'clock 
15 the ballots are supposed to stop. 
16 You know, like, all those little election irregularities --and there's been tons of 
17 people --like, I follow all of that because I was involved, right? So all these things I read 
18 about all the time, all the different cases, right? And there are plenty of people who 
19 have been caught with election fraud in multiple States still, and they're still getting 
20 caught and charged with it. 
21 But everyone acts like each one of those little incidents isn't enough to add up, 
22 which is fine. And that's why I thought that there should've been audits. 
23 And that's why --another reason, that day, on January 6th, I didn't go there to 
24 break in or stop the certification of anything. 
25 Q What'd you go in for?  1 
2 
3 
4 A 
Q 
A I didn't go in at all -­
Okay. 
--was one thing. But also --16 
Mr. Cocis. No, Easton, I think --no. When you're saying you didn't go in at all, 
5 you went into the tunnel. But are you talking about, like, going inside the Capitol or --
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 Mr. Cantwell. No. The prosecutor said I didn't go inside. 
Mr. Cocis. Yeah, no, we're not --yeah. No, you didn't go inside the Capitol. 
Mr. Cantwell. I didn't go inside the Capitol Building, so --yeah. 
BY 
Q We'll get into that later, about where you were on the Capitol Grounds and 
11 what were you doing. 
12 Did you participate in any activities after the general election related to alleged 
13 voter fraud or irregularities? 
14 
15 
16 
17 A 
Q 
A 
Q Did I participate in it? What do you mean? 
Like, any rallies or anything like that. 
No. 
Did you go to any events or help complete any affidavits for any lawsuits 
18 related to election irregularities --alleged election irregularities? 
19 
20 A 
Q 
21 affidavits? 
22 
23 A 
Q No. 
Okay. Were you recruited for any of these type of efforts related to 
No. 
Just to confirm, you did not go to rallies protesting the 2020 election in 
24 November in Washington, D.C.? 
25 A No.  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 Q Or the December 12th rally in D.C. either, you didn't go to that one? 
A No. 
Q Okay. 
A The one and only rally I've ever been to is the January 6th. 
Q So, I guess, tell us about the factors that influenced you to come to D.C. for 
6 January 6th. 17 
7 And I'd like to note, before you answer that, that my colleague who's 
8 also an investigative counsel, has joined this deposition. 
9 But getting back to my question, tell us about any factors that influenced your 
10 decision to come on January 6th. 
11 A The reason why I came was, I had recently gotten with a new girlfriend, and 
12 she has a dad who was a chaplain in the Army, and him and five other guys were going to 
13 go to the Stop the Steal rally on January 6th. They told me about it a few days in 
14 advance, and my girlfriend said it would probably be a good idea to go. 
15 And I've thought about the reason why she said that, and the reason was because 
16 it was more of, like, a bonding opportunity for me and her dad to get to know each other 
17 after, you know, we had just kind of gotten together. And they're a very close family. 
18 So I figured 8 hours in the car to D.C. --and I hadn't been to D.C. as an adult. I'd 
19 been there as a child, like, 3 or 4 years old. So I kind of wanted to go to the Washington 
20 Monument and the Lincoln Memorial and see the White House and the Capitol Building. 
21 And so that's why I went. I didn't really go to go to voice anything. That wasn't 
22 my intention to go at all. 
23 
24 
25 Q You said her father was in the Army as well? 
A Yeah. 
Q Okay. I forgot to ask earlier, what led to your other-than-honorable  1 discharge? 
2 
3 
4 
5 A I'd rather not say. 
Q Okay. 
A It's extenuating circumstances, but I'd rather not discuss it. 
Q What's on your paperwork that says why you got an other than honorable. 
6 Was it an Article 15, a court-martial? Just give me that. 
7 
8 A 
Q What do you mean? Like, it's other than honorable. I just told you. 
Right. And what is the substantiation for it? Was it due to letters of 18 
9 reprimand, an Article 15, a court-martial? What led to that discharge characterization? 
10 
11 
12 
13 A 
Q Yeah, an Article 15, I guess. I don't know. It was a discharge. 
Misconduct discharge? PT discharge? 
A No, neither of those. 
Q Okay. 
14 Did anything that the former President say to you influence you to make you want 
15 to come on January 6th? 
16 
17 
18 
19 A 
Q 
A 
Q No. 
Do you recall the President's December 19th tweet talking about the rally? 
No. 
I guess you said a couple days before your girlfriend at the time asked you to 
20 come. Can you give us, like, a possible date or approximate date of when you decided 
21 to come? 
A I don't know. Like, January 3rd or 4th probably? 22 
23 He had texted me and said he was going. And, you know, I talked to her. I said, 
24 you know, what do you think? She said, I mean, yeah, it'd probably be cool to go. And 
25 I told her all the reasons I hadn't been. So it wasn't like she convinced me or nothing.  19 
1 She just said, you know, it probably wouldn't be a bad idea. 
2 And then I went, and we just rode there in a van full of Christian guys who all, like, 
3 hang out with each other. They're all older than I was, in their 40s or 50s. And they 
4 only went up to the --all of them, except for him, went only to the Ellipse park area. 
5 
6 
7 Q Got it. Okay. We'll get into January 6th still --
A Yeah. 
Q --in a little bit. 
8 So did you look at any social media posts or websites about the rallies going on on 
9 January 6th before you came down? 
10 A Not really. I knew that there was going to be a Stop the Steal rally, but I 
11 hadn't really gotten into it, because I wasn't ever, like, into --the only thing I did was, he 
12 sent me a link for the event for Ellipse park, which was a list of things that you couldn't 
13 bring into the Ellipse park to go through Secret Service. 
14 So we did not bring anything that could be --we didn't bring any flags or signs. 
15 Bags couldn't be over a certain size. I had a Camel Bak, but it said on there that it was up 
16 to Secret Service discretion. 
17 So we were trying to get there to get into Ellipse park, to be up close enough. 
18 And we got there early, but we were still --there was, like, a mile long all the way --it 
19 was, like, all the way around the --it was, like, all the way around the --sorry. 
20 
21 Q 
A No worries. 
It was all the way around the Washington Monument. So we decided not 
22 to go and try and get in the line to get in, and we just ended up walking around. 
23 
24 Q Got it. 
You've mentioned Stop the Steal. Did you follow Ali Alexander during this time 
25 period?  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 A 
Q 
A 
Q Who? 
Mr. Ali Alexander. Is that someone you followed on social media? 
No. I don't know who that is. 
Okay. 
I guess, as you were coming to D.C. for January 6th, I know your father --or your 
6 girlfriend's father sent you the Ellipse portion handout. Were there any speakers that 
7 you were particularly excited to see for January 6th? 
No. I didn't know who was going to be there other than Trump. 20 
8 
9 A 
Q Was former President Trump one of the reasons why you wanted to come, I 
10 guess, here to the Ellipse? 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Sure. 
Okay. 
Among the many. 
What are some of the others, other reasons? 
To see the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial and the Capitol 
16 Building and the White House and the historic place of our country, because I'd never 
17 been there except when I was 3. 
18 
19 Q 
A Did you do those touristy things and stuff when you came down? 
I did. I did that all that morning while they were --because we were 
20 anticipating having to stand in line, like I said. And since the line was so long, we ended 
21 up just walking around and taking pictures at a couple of the places --you know, National 
22 Mall kind of stuff. 
23 Q Were there any other elected officials, other than former President Trump, 
24 that, I guess, you might've been excited to see or might've influenced your decision to 
25 want to be in D.C. that day?  1 
2 A 
Q 21 
No, because I didn't know who was going to be speaking. 
Okay. Well, I guess, just sum this up for us, just to put a pin in it, 
3 ultimately, what was your goal in traveling or what was your purpose in traveling to D.C. 
4 for January 6th? 
5 A All I heard was it was supposed to be, like, a million-person rally, and it was 
6 going to be this really giant rally. And I wanted to bond with my girlfriend's dad, see 
7 D.C., see a little bit of Trump there, and be around that many people I'd never been 
8 around --or even seen that many people in one place, so I was kind of interested to see 
9 it. 
10 
11 
12 - do you have any followup there? 
-Yeah. 
How are you doing, Mr. Cantwell? Thanks for joining us. And I'm sorry I was a 
13 little late. 
14 
15 
16 
17 Mr. Cantwell. That's okay. 
Q 
A Were you excited to hear President Trump talk about any topics? 
I mean, I didn't know exactly all of everything he would be bringing up that 
18 day. I wasn't necessarily excited to hear him, you know, say anything particular, 
19 just --he says the same stuff at all the rallies anyways. It's the same thing. So I wasn't 
20 expecting much. I watch him usually on VouTube. I just went mostly so I could spend 
21 time with her dad, you know. 
22 Q And I apologize if you covered this earlier, but you said you weren't following 
23 who Ali Alexander was at the time. Do you remember where you knew that this would 
24 be, like, a Stop the Steal event? 
25 A Her dad had known about it, and he told her, and she told me, and then we  22 
1 texted each other about it. And that was the only way I knew about it. 
2 Like, there's rallies all the time, and I don't, like --I don't put any mental effort into 
3 rallies. You know what I mean? Like, where they're at or who's going to be there. 
4 Because I generally don't care, so --because I don't go to rallies. That was the first one 
5 and the last one I will go to. Trust me. 
6 Yeah. So there wasn't anything in particular or anyone in particular I wanted to 
7 hear or know about. The only thing I knew that was going to be happening that day was 
8 they were going to be looking at evidence of election fraud in a variety of States in the 
9 House and the Senate. They were going to be, you know, deciding on that. And then 
10 the evidence was supposed to be heard until everyone broke in. And then the majority 
11 of the States rejected that. 
12 So I don't know. You know what I mean? Like, I didn't go there for any 
13 particular reason, to hear anybody specific. 
14 Q Did you think President Trump would be talking about those topics, though, 
15 would be talking about election --
16 A Well, yeah, I'm sure he would've. Yeah, I mean, that seems kind of 
17 obvious, that he would be talking about that, since it's called the Stop the Steal rally. 
18 mean --
19 
20 
21 
22 Q 
Q Okay. 
Thank you 
B~ 
I mean, you're saying it's obvious. So it sounds like you did follow the news 
23 of the rally, then, right? 
24 A It's called Stop the Steal rally. The name is in it. You don't have to be a 
25 genius to kind of look into that and kind of see --you know what I mean --like, what's  23 
1 going on with it. 
2 Q Well, I will correct you though. It wasn't. It was a Women for America 
3 First rally that President Trump spoke at. Stop the Steal was a separate rally. 
4 So I guess that's why I'm asking, what were you following in the lead-up to January 
5 6th? 
6 A Well, that's what I'm saying, is that all I ever heard of was a Stop the Steal 
7 rally. That's all that was on --all that I was told. 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 Q Okay. 
So when did you arrive in Washington, D.C.? 
A I arrived at, like, 3:00 a.m. --
Q Of January 6th? 
A --on January 6th. 
Q And you said you and your girlfriend's father and his friends all carpooled 
14 together? 
15 
16 
17 6th? 
18 
19 
20 
21 A 
Q 
A Yeah. He rented a van --one of the guys there rented a van and drove us. 
Did you stay the night at all in D.C., or did you all just come up for January 
We just came up for January 6th. We left after that. 
Q Got it. 
Did you expect there was going to be violence in D.C. on January 6th? 
A No. As a matter of fact, I was expecting there to be none. And we didn't 
22 want there to be none --we were hoping that there wouldn't be any. 
23 Because there had been so many --every time that there was protests or rallies, 
24 there was always antifa or somebody else there as well. Or vice versa, when antifa or 
25 something, then the Proud Boys or somebody would show up. And we just didn't want  24 
1 there to be any violence. 
2 We were hoping that, since it was in D.C., that that wouldn't happen. But it's 
3 happened before, so --
4 Q You mentioned the Proud Boys. I guess, how familiar before January 6th or 
5 at all were you with the Proud Boys? 
6 A It's just a --I knew that it was a --like, originally supposed to be, like, some 
7 Christian group of conservatives, and then I guess they became radicalized or something. 
8 I have no clue. But that's just from reading from the news, and that's a var---like, from 
9 all the news sites. 
10 It's just like seeing antifa or Black Lives Matter or any of these other groups that 
11 are out there. I just lump them all together as just a bunch of people fighting with each 
12 other. 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Were you aware of the Proud Boys before January 6th? 
I'm sorry, aware of what? 
Who the Proud Boys were before January 6th. 
Who they were? Yeah, I was aware of who they were. 
And, I guess, were they in the --like, you described reading a lot of news 
18 sources earlier. You said you read 3 to 4 hours. Were these part of the articles you 
19 were reading, mention the Proud Boys or about the Proud Boys? 
20 
21 A 
Q Yeah. 
And what are the Proud Boys mentioned mostly --do you remember what 
22 types of news articles they were mentioned in? 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A Generally CNN articles was talking about the Proud Boys. ABC, NBC. 
Were you tracking the Oath Keepers as well? 
I wasn't tracking them, but I knew that they existed, along with the Three  25 
1 Percenters as well. 
2 Q Yeah. I guess, overall, how were you aware of who these organizations 
3 were? 
4 A The same way you know who al-Qaida or ISIS is. Just the news. You know 
5 what I mean? Like, you hear about them on the news. They're fighting --burning 
6 down places and fighting with each other on the streets. Like --
7 
8 
9 
10 Q 
A 
Q 
A Were you aware of who Stewart Rhodes or Enrique Tarrio specifically were? 
No. 
Do you know --
Enrique Tarrio sounds familiar, though. I think I've read about him from 
11 the January 6th cases, correct? Yeah. 
12 Wait. Is he one of the leaders of the Proud Boys? Yeah, I read that in one of 
13 the recent articles about him for --he's going to trial or something. I just keep track of 
14 all the trials. 
15 Q Got it. 
16 So you got to D.C. at 3:00 a.m. on January 6th --oh, -do you have a 
17 followup? 
18 
19 
20 - Yeah. 
BY-
Q I was just wondering --you mentioned that you weren't expecting violence. 
21 But you also seemed to lump together Oath Keepers, Proud Boys, Three Percenters with, 
22 like, what you said, Black Lives Matter and antifa and these sort of people who fight each 
23 other. 
24 So, if you knew the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers and Three Percenters were 
25 going to be at January 6th -- A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q I never said that. 
Did you not say that? 
No. 
So did you only learn afterwards that they were there? 
Yes. 
Okay. Never mind. Thanks. B-26 
1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 Q Were you tracking that the Proud Boys or Oath Keepers were at prior rallies 
9 in D.C.? 
10 
11 A 
Q No. 
So, I guess, where did you see news articles about the Proud Boys fighting? 
12 What was it in relation to? 
13 
14 A 
Q I mean, I could give you --would you like very specifics, like --
I'll give you specifics. You don't recall the Proud Boys being reported on 
15 from the December rally in D.C.? 
16 
17 A 
Q 
18 rally in D.C.? 
19 A No. 
You don't remember the Proud Boys being reported on from the November 
No. I remember them fighting in California and at Black Lives Matter rallies 
20 and antifa rallies, usually countering them. It's mostly you see them in California and, 
21 like, when they were in --what is it --Kenosha, Michigan, and all that over there. 
22 Q Do you recall any reporting about violence in the D.C. rallies in November or 
23 December? 
24 A I do remember there was violence at Trump's inaugura- --like, his 
25 inauguration. And I remember there was violence whenever he walked across to that  27 
1 church and they had to spread open the crowd so he could do a photo-op. I mean, 
2 that's the truth. Whatever it is it is. I'll call it like I see it. 
3 But those were all people from the left, though. So I didn't see people from the 
4 right there. That was --you know what I mean? I thought it was just going to be a big 
5 rally of a bunch of people, patriotic people, you know, American-loving conservatives, just 
6 like you see at all these different rallies he has. 
7 Generally, the only time that anything bad happens is when he tells some idiot to 
8 leave and they should be punched in the head or whatever. You know what I mean? 
9 Like, that's the most climactic. But not, like, full-on --do you know what I mean? Like, 
10 I wouldn't have expected that, because so many people and it being --I just wasn't 
11 expecting it. I really wasn't. Like --
12 
13 
14 Q Yeah. We hear you. 
So let's get into January 6th, then. 
So you arrive at 3:00 a.m., approximately 3:00 a.m. What do you do in the 
15 morning before the Ellipse event starts that morning? 
16 A For --well, the other guys --we found a parking garage, like, an underground 
17 parking garage, like, somewhere between I and 17th Street, I think, or something. 
18 could be wrong; it might be 7th Street. I don't remember. I know it was north of 
19 Pennsylvania Avenue, though, not far past Chinatown and --anyways. 
20 So me and Jody stayed up, because we couldn't sleep. And we just sat around 
21 talking in the parking deck downstairs. And there was, like, a truck that was all painted 
22 with, like, a bajillion Trump stickers and stuff, like, down in the basement with other cars, 
23 like, that were, you know --they were, like, parade-type cars that were parked down 
24 there. It was basically empty of people. Everyone was not in there. 
25 And the other guys slept, and we just sat there for roughly, I don't know, 2 to 3  28 
1 hours. And then we woke the other guys up and decided to go get coffee at the Dunkin' 
2 Donuts that's downtown there. 
3 And then we walked further, till we walked across Pennsylvania. And then we 
4 made a right on, I think it's Continental. 
5 
6 Q Connecticut? 
A Connecticut, yeah, sorry. Made a right on Connecticut and headed towards 
7 Ellipse park. 
8 
9 Q Got it. 
So did you --I know you said the line was long. Did you actually stay for the 
10 program on the Ellipse at all, for any of the speeches? 
11 A So, basically, at 6 o'clock, like, we got there, and some of us stayed in --like, 
12 we kind of set up outside of the Ellipse park. Like, there was the long fencing, the black 
13 fencing that surrounds Ellipse park, and then there was, like, a bunch of vendors and 
14 toilets that were in between there. And the Washington Monument was back behind it, 
15 right? So we kind of --like, the third tree over from the fence, right, in front of us, we 
16 picked, like, a spot there where we would all line up and meet back at. 
17 And then me and Jody left the group, and they went and did whatever they did. 
18 Mostly they just tried to find bathrooms and stuff. And then me and Jody walked 
19 around. And then we waited in line for the bathrooms, which in itself took an hour, and 
20 we just stood around talking. 
21 And we met a bunch of people. We were walking around, and we talked to --I 
22 talked to some random --quite a few, like, random Chinese American nationals that 
23 moved here from China. And they had big, you know, "Down with the CCP" things up, 
24 and, you know, they were like, "We don't want communism in America." 
25 You know, there was just a bunch of really --mostly everybody was happy,  29 
1 everybody was peaceful all morning. Like, the whole time we were at the rally there in 
2 front of Ellipse, people were singing and dancing and talking with each other. 
3 And, like, that's all I did. We just went there, and I walked to the Washington 
4 Monument, took pictures there, down to the Lincoln Memorial and there. And I took a 
5 picture somewhere with my middle finger up, I'm sure, in front of the IRS building as a 
6 joke. 
7 But that was pretty much --my entire morning was just kind of walking around in 
8 the crowd. There were so many people that it took so long to, like, even walk 
9 anywhere. 
10 Q Right. So you actually didn't see any speeches then? 
11 A I was outside of the park, and you could hear part of the speeches every now 
12 and then. But mostly it was, like, what they were singing, like, or when they 
13 would --when they'd start chanting, I mean, not singing. Like, when they would say 
14 "Build the wall" or "Lock her up" --you know what I mean? --you could hear them. And 
15 then they sang the National Anthem and different stuff, you know. 
16 So, like, you could hear the crowd roar after he, like, faintly said stuff. But I 
17 couldn't actually hear what was being said during the speech, right? Like --
18 
19 Q Okay. So you didn't hear President Trump's speech at all on January 6th? 
A No, not until afterwards. Like, that way, on the way home, I actually 
20 watched it. 
21 
22 
23 
24 Q What led you, then, to go to the Capitol Building? 
A When we were walking out, we got out of the --
Q Out of the Ellipse or out of --where were you walking out of? 
A We were walking away from where we were standing there, which was on 
25 Connecticut there.  30 
1 Q Okay. 
2 A And we walked towards the Capitol but along the fence that was on the 
3 Ellipse park. And we made a left to go back to Pennsylvania, which meets up with, you 
4 know, the White House and everything there. 
5 So we were walking down that, and there was this, like, group, and they were 
6 handing out fliers. And one of the ladies that was there --she was an older lady, I don't 
7 know, like, in her 60s or so --she was like, "Are you guys going to the Capitol Building to 
8 listen to Trump?" And we were like, "What? No. We didn't know there was more, 
9 like, speaking and more stuff going on." And she was like, "Yeah, we're all supposed to 
10 go down to the Capitol. That's where everybody's going now." 
11 So I was like, I don't know, man. I asked Jody, I was like, do you want to go? 
12 Because, like, we've been standing, and we drove 8 hours here, we haven't slept, we 
13 worked yesterday --you know what I mean? --and then we drove all the way here, we've 
14 been standing, it's freezing cold. Like, what else are they going to say? What do you 
15 want to do? 
16 And the other guys were like, "We're going to go back to the van." And Jody was 
17 like, "Yeah, I don't know. I mean, it couldn't hurt. And I've never been to the Capitol 
18 Building." And I was like, "Well, me neither. We could go up there, and I could get a 
19 picture in front of Capitol Building with you." You know what I mean? 
20 Like, so we just went up there, and that's, like --I didn't get to the outside of the 
21 building until, like, 2:40. 
22 Q Okay. So you arrived around --what time, I guess, did this woman say 
23 "we're going to the Capitol" or whatever she said to you? Around what time was that, 
24 approximately? 
25 A When we left, it was, like, after the speech and after people, like, were  31 
1 leaving, because we had to wait on our friends to meet back up with us. They were, like, 
2 trying to work their way back to us. And since that was our meeting point and one of 
3 the guys didn't know where the van was, so we couldn't just meet, like, back at the van, 
4 so we had to wait there. 
5 When we left --I don't remember. I can't remember what time his speech 
6 ended. I know it was --he didn't start until, like --
7 Q It ended at 1:10 p.m. eastern time. 
8 A It ended at 1:10? 
9 Q Correct. 
10 A Well, it couldn't have been, like, but 5 minutes then after we left. Because 
11 at 1:49 p.m. I was on, I can't remember, I think it was 17th Street. And then I calculated 
12 it was, like, a 17-to 20-minute walk with nobody in the way, like, to the Capitol from 
13 there. And then, you know, walking through the crowd, so that's why it took me that 
14 amount of time. 
15 So, yeah, I'd say at about 1:15 to 1:17 or so we probably left from there. 
16 Q Okay. 
17 And, I guess, what side of the Capitol --do you recall what you saw as you walked 
18 up to the Capitol? 
19 A I just saw tons of people everywhere, like, just tons of people. I remember 
20 walking by the --there's a statue that's out farther away from the Capitol. I can't 
21 remember what the name of that --
22 
23 Q The Peace Monument? 
A Yes. Okay. Yeah, I remember walking by that. And that's obviously on 
24 the west side of the Capitol, right? And I just walked --we walked around it, ended up 
25 being in the grass and, like, kind of more facing towards the Capitol. There was, like,  32 
1 some trees and stuff there. 
2 And I never saw any barricades or anything. All I saw was people. That was it, 
3 all the way up to where I got. Like, the only time I saw barricades was, like, pretty much 
4 whenever I got up to the steps. And then I realized that there was --what was going on. 
5 Q So, before you got up to those steps, you didn't see, you know, any 
6 remnants of flash-bangs or officers trying to repel with OC spray? You didn't see any of 
7 that as you --you just walked up to the steps of the west side --
8 
9 
10 A No. 
Q --of the Capitol? 
A Yeah. All you could see was, like, a sea of people. And when I got there, I 
11 was just walking up, there was, like, people on loud speakers. It was so loud. Like, it 
12 was so loud. There was people yelling. 
13 And whenever I got up to about the steps, I heard, like, a bang, which sounded like 
14 a flash-bang. Because I did know what it sounds like. But, like, I didn't hear it 
15 until --I'm also, like, a little deaf in my right ear anyways, but I can still hear. But right as 
16 I got up to the steps was when I heard the first, like, flash-bang that I recognized as a 
17 flash-bang. 
18 
19 Q Okay. 
A And I was already in with, like, a crowd of people, like, moving up the stairs, 
20 and people were behind me. And so, when we got up the stairs, there was no officer or 
21 anybody in my way all the way up, until I got up to, like, the lower-level terrace. 
22 Because there's a set of stairs there; you've got to go up and left and straight up. 
23 And then to the left was the way to get up onto the bleachers, the left-side stadium 
24 bleachers for the inauguration. They had the left and the right side and then the one in 
25 the middle. I was, like --I got forced in, like, between. I didn't make it all the way into  33 
1 the center of it, and I didn't make it all the way onto the left side. There was just, like, a 
2 path of people, and they were just walking straight up the steps. And I just walked right 
3 up there with Jody. 
4 And there was a cop that was blocking going onto that other side. But there was 
5 no --like, he was telling people to go to the other side, to the right, like, you know, away. 
6 "Don't come this way. Go up the bleachers" or whatever, you know, not where we 
7 were. 
8 And then, when we got up there, then I recognized that there was people all 
9 under the bleachers. Later, I come to find out they fought for those bleachers. I didn't 
10 know that. Like, I now know that from watching the videos. But when I got up there, I 
11 didn't know all that fighting was even going on. 
12 Like, I heard a flash-bang, and I was like, okay, they must be getting out of control 
13 over here, you know, they must've pissed those officers off. But I didn't --I figured, like, 
14 that wasn't a good sign, obviously. 
15 And then, when I'm up there, then stuff started getting, like --I noticed how 
16 chaotic it actually seemed. Like, people were pushing on the barricades against the 
17 officers. 
18 But, generally, the most of the crowd behind everybody, I mean, they weren't 
19 doing anything. Everyone just was standing there waving flags and talking and whistling. 
20 You know what I mean? 
21 Q I guess, why did --you described a sea of people. Why did you continue 
22 walking when you saw the sea of people at the Capitol? 
23 
24 A Why did I continue walking? 
Q Towards the Capitol. Like, you see this sea of people as you walk up on the 
25 west side of the Capitol. Why did you continue still going towards the Capitol when you  34 
1 saw all these folks out there? 
2 A I don't know. Get close for --this one wasn't blocked off, you know? It 
3 was just like a concert. Like, I go to EDM festivals where there's 100,000 people. If you 
4 want to get up front, see who you're --you just work your way through the crowd. I do 
5 it all the time. 
6 Q I guess, what are you trying to get up front for? Are you trying to go in the 
7 Capitol? I guess, just help me understand what you're trying to get in the front of. 
8 A We were just going up to take pictures. That was what I went up there for, 
9 to take pictures and video. I went up there to watch speakers. I didn't know that 
10 there was going to be fighting. I thought there was going to be people talking. 
11 
12 
13 know. 
14 
15 Q Oh, okay. So who did you think was going to be talking at the Capitol? 
A Well, the lady said Trump and other speakers are going over there, so I didn't 
Q So, then, you know, you described --
A And Trump did say he was going to the Capitol with them that day, did he 
16 not? So her telling me that is not out of context. Like, she told us that Trump was 
17 going up there because he said it. And apparently she knew. But I couldn't hear, 
18 where I was at. 
19 Q At that time, were you tracking that President Trump had said that he was 
20 going to go to the Capitol? 
21 A At the time after the lady told me. Yeah. Because that was the whole 
22 reason I went to the Capitol, was because she'd said that Trump and other speakers were 
23 going to be at the Capitol. 
24 Q So hearing President Trump speak at the Capitol was a pretty big motivator 
25 for you going there that day?  35 
1 A Yeah. And to take pictures of the Capitol and with Jody in front of the 
2 Capitol. 
3 Q So you described getting up, I guess, on the lower west terrace, so the west 
4 side of the Capitol. Describe to us what happened then, once you got up there. 
5 A Well, then I actually took a video or so, and I ended up noticing, like I said, 
6 that things looked like they were getting chaotic. And while I was standing up to the 
7 bleachers, I took a video, and it was like, "Oh, there's so many people," you know, "this is 
8 crazy," you know. 
9 And, basically, while I was videoing, a bunch more flash-bangs went off, and stuff 
10 looked like it got chaotic. But then everything kind of stopped for a second, and all the 
11 police line fell back, right? Like, they all left. And then everyone just started walking 
12 up there. 
13 You know, there was a couple of people who were, like, in aggravated things, and 
14 it looked like the police were going to arrest them for, you know, being idiots, which I 
15 would imagine the police would do any time that people are being idiots. So, like, they 
16 were fighting back and forth on different little sections, but then there was --
17 Q I'm going to stop you real quick. I'm going to stop you. But you did notice 
18 the police lines falling back? Is that what you said? 
19 A Yes. They basically just left, right? So then everyone started walking up 
20 into the Capitol. 
21 Q And you saw that? Like, you saw the police lines fall back and then people 
22 follow into the Capitol? 
23 A Yeah. Basically the police line fell back, right, and they went inside, is what 
24 it looked like, and up higher. Like, they went in different areas. Like, they just 
25 didn't --it was almost like they didn't care about them being on that terrace anymore. It  36 
1 was like they fell back to a higher position. Do you get what I mean? Like --
2 Q Oh, no, I was actually going to say, you're former military. Did you take it 
3 as them not caring or them retreating because they were outnumbered? 
4 A I figured it was probably the outnumbered. You know, they fell back 
5 because there were so many people there, and they were having a squabble, and they 
6 probably fell back to a more defensible, narrower area. Which is what they did, I mean, 
7 essentially. 
8 Q So I guess that takes me back to my previous question. Why did you 
9 continue walking forward? 
10 A Well, then, at that point, I knew that there was some crazy shit going on that 
11 hadn't happened before, so then I wanted to videotape it. 
12 Which is what I ended up doing. I went up and videotaped. But I never fought 
13 with the police or destroyed property or went in the building. 
14 Q So, I guess, what --you're recording it. What types of chants or what's 
15 being said around you by the other protesters that were on the Capitol Grounds? 
16 A Like, mostly people were saying --chants? I mean, really, it was more like 
17 people were saying, you know, "Let us in," you know, "We have a right to be heard," 
18 and --you know. 
19 Honestly, where I got stuck, most people were screaming from not being able to 
20 see or breathe. And they were more angry about the battle that they were fighting right 
21 there than they were about, like, whatever was going on. 
22 See, at that time, I didn't even know that, like --I knew that, that day, Congress 
23 and Senate were going to be convening to do that, but I didn't know that they were doing 
24 that right at that moment. Do you know what I mean? 
25 Q I do. So I guess I just want to clarify, you weren't confirming that the  37 
1 certification hearing started at --like, you weren't tracking that it started at 1:00 p.m.? 
2 A No, I didn't know what time it was that day. I honestly thought it was going 
3 on while we were having the rally, because that made sense, you know? 
4 Like --it's like --and, you know, just to have a protest outside, it doesn't --people 
5 show up at Trump Tower all the time, and he's not even there, and they protest him. 
6 You know what I mean? 
7 So I just think, you know, a protest --I don't necessarily know that they're even at 
8 the building at the time. I didn't really. I had no clue. I didn't know whether it had 
9 already happened or whether it was going to be happening later. 
10 So, towards the end --
11 Q But you did think President Trump was going to be speaking at the Capitol, 
12 though? 
13 A I did think he was going to be speaking, though, because the lady had told 
14 me. Other than that, I didn't even --remember, I barely even knew who the speakers 
15 were for the actual rally. All I knew was he was going to be there. So I certainly 
16 wouldn't have known about an impromptu one that I didn't know about, you know? 
17 
18 
19 Q 
A 
Q So you were in the tunnel area of the west -­
Yeah, the west lower tunnel entrance. Yeah. 
Okay. And can you describe the scene that you witnessed when you were 
20 at the tunnel? 
21 A So, when I noticed everyone started walking up there, me and Jody went 
22 down, and we walked calmly --we didn't run or anything, you know. I just walked over 
23 there. And there was people going right and left, like, up the stairs. And then some 
24 people went to the lower tunnel entrance, right? 
25 And I walked up there, and I was videoing. And the police looked like they were,  38 
1 like, you know --there was a bunch of police that were in that hallway that had, like, riot 
2 gear on, right? Which, most of the ones on the top where I had been watching were 
3 wearing, like, yellow vests and stuff. They weren't riot --you know, not all of them. 
4 There was, like, little groups outside, you know, like, of four or something, but not like 
5 this. There was, like, 30 of them in this tunnel. 
6 So I'm walking over, and we're videoing. And, like, I don't even know if I videoed 
7 right then. I don't think I did. I was just walking over. And everyone started coming 
8 in behind us, like, pretty heavy, you know, like, a flood of people. Like, they were in a 
9 hurry. 
10 When I had been close, I guess I ended up being towards the front somehow. 
11 Because the way people split up and went left and right and center, you know, it 
12 wasn't --I don't know. I don't know how it happened, but they ended up 
13 coming --getting behind me. And so I'm standing there, like, walking, getting up to it, 
14 and then there's this --I don't know how I got caught up, but I did. I got caught up in 
15 this flood of people towards the center. 
16 And when I was right at the top of the stairs, facing the doors, some guys came in, 
17 and they started fighting with the police, right? Like, acting like they're going to get the 
18 doors. 
19 And then, I don't know, a guy had, like, a flagpole or something, and he, like, hit 
20 the door and then swung it open. I don't know. It's on my video. But, basically, 
21 whenever he started fighting with the police right there, that was the first up-close, like, 
22 actual visual of, you know, somebody fighting with the police. 
23 The other ones out were, like, it just looked like dudes, like, swinging, like, 
24 flagpoles around --you know what I mean? --and, like, shaking the --what do you call 
25 them, the barricades. But, here, this looked like actual, like, altercation between  39 
1 them --you know what I mean? --like, grabbing each other and stuff. 
2 And so I pulled out my phone, because I'm like, you know, I'm going to catch this. 
3 So I started videoing, and he broke the door. So I ended up being there videoing when 
4 the door got broke on the glass. And I was like, oh, shit, this is, like --you know, this 
5 isn't good. 
6 And so everyone's running behind, coming in. And I just --no one else had their 
7 phones out or anything, so I literally just started videoing. 
8 And I was live-videoing some on Facebook, because my --I had posted, or tried to 
9 post, on Face book. And my friends all knew I was there because of my business and 
10 stuff; it's strange for me to be gone anyways. But they knew I was there, and they were 
11 like, "Hey, will you show some video of what's going on?" And so I'm like, "Okay." 
12 They're like, "The news isn't showing us anything yet. We don't know what's going on." 
13 So I'm, like, videoing. And then that's --I got caught up and pushed further into 
14 the tunnel. But I never went past the doors. Like, I fought to stay outside of the doors. 
15 And then you couldn't really get out. I got kind of squished in there. And 
16 they're spraying pepper spray; it's really hard to breathe. And so I climbed up on a ledge 
17 to be not crushed by the people and the police and also to try and get some air, like, 
18 above everybody. And then I just kind of stood there and videoed while they fought. 
19 And, you know, there was people that was getting hurt. I helped a couple of 
20 people actually, like, pull out from being crushed, you know, into a little side area and, 
21 like, helped funnel them along the edge. 
22 There was a lady --that was more towards when everybody got pushed out, 
23 like --and I kind of got wedged in the corner of --I don't know. In that hallway, there 
24 was, like, maybe 2-1/2 feet on each side of that archway, and I got caught in there. 
25 And eventually I couldn't take it anymore, and I climbed out over everybody and  40 
1 walked on them to get out. Because I couldn't breathe, I couldn't see anymore. 
2 Videoing was --I couldn't do that; I would've lost my phone. At one point, I was 
3 squished so much that I felt like I was a pea in a pod, like, going to be pushed out. 
4 Q You said that individuals knew you were there and they wanted you to, like, 
5 stream it on Facebook? Is that correct? 
6 
7 A 
Q Yeah. 
How were you contacting people? Everyone we've heard from didn't have 
8 service. So it sounds like you had service while you were --
9 A No, it was selective. It was here and there. Like, I was trying to live-video, 
10 and it wouldn't work most of the time. It was really digital. So I started videoing 
11 myself and then trying to upload them. 
12 But, yeah, occasionally you could get service. 
13 
14 Q 
A Okay. 
And I had the service whenever I was, like, up on the bleacher area. So that 
15 probably would've been the last time that I saw a post where someone --like, it was in a 
16 private DM message too, so I don't know. 
17 Q And you weren't just video recording. I mean, it's in your statement of 
18 facts where you are saying, "Get the door open." So you were advocating for people to 
19 get the door open at the Capitol that day, correct? 
20 
21 A 
Q Yeah, I said, "Get the door open." 
Why were you saying "get the door open," and who were you saying "get 
22 the door open" to? 
23 A I was saying "get the door open" in the fact of all those people who were 
24 there. I wasn't speaking to anyone in particular, because no one knows who I am. 
25 wasn't telling anybody specific to get the door open.  41 
1 People had been --that was another one of the things that people were shouting, 
2 "Get the door open." They were saying, "Push." They were saying, "You're traitors. 
3 You should let us through. We're doing this for you." 
4 Q Right. So "get the door open," "let us through," the other thing you just 
5 said, was to get inside the Capitol Building, wasn't it? 
6 
7 
8 A Yeah. 
Q So, at this point --
A When you're being crushed from one side, with a million people behind you, 
9 which way would you rather go? 
10 Q Which gets me back to my original question, then. Why'd you walk to the 
11 Capitol? 
12 
13 A 
Q I told you why I walked to the Capitol. 
But here's the thing. It's hard to take it both ways. You're saying you're 
14 only saying "get the door open" because you're being crushed, but then you also are 
15 saying you walked up to the Capitol. The two answers just aren't making much sense, 
16 Mr. Cantwell. 
17 A They make perfect sense. I went up to the Capitol to take pictures and 
18 video, and then I took pictures and video. That's --it's pretty plain. 
19 And then I was being crushed, and I had no place to go. It's either get the door 
20 open, let us through --and, by the way, that was the only place where people didn't get 
21 in, might I add. Everywhere else --at that point, there were already eight entry points 
22 into the Capitol and where people had been let in through magnetically sealed doors. 
23 And that's all on video. 
24 Do you see what I mean? Like, I was being crushed. And there was people 
25 already filling all of the whole Capitol Building -- 42 
Q So, if you were being crushed --
--at that time. At 2:49 p.m., Congress was already released as well. 1 
2 
3 A 
Q Mr. Cantwell --Mr. Cantwell, if you're being crushed --and I'm just trying to 
4 understand the survival instincts here --why are you recording? 
5 
6 A I wasn't being --what do you mean? 
Q You were saying --you just told me you were being crushed, but yet you're 
7 still recording it on your phone. 
8 A That was when I'm up on top of the thing. There's no place to go, left, 
9 right. You're just standing in a hallway being pepper-sprayed. You can't breathe. 
10 
11 
12 Q 
A Right. So why are you recording -­
You can't barely see. 
Q --then? Right. So why are you recording if you're being pepper-sprayed 
13 and can't --
14 A It's history. It was history. What do you --there's nothing funny about 
15 that. That's my take on it. Like, I'm sorry you don't believe me, but that is what it is. 
16 I went up there to take pictures and video, and I got stuck in the hallway. And 
17 what I said was wrong. I should not have been instigating people to go forward. I am 
18 accepting full responsibility for that. What I said I said. And, you know --
19 
20 Mr. Cocis. When you say it's history, what do you mean by that? 
Mr. Cantwell. This was a very historical moment. People breaking into the 
21 Capitol? I had never heard of that before, like that. Granted, now that after I've 
22 looked it up, I know that there was --the Capitol's been bombed before and all kinds of 
23 stuff. 
24 BYMR.-: 
25 Q People breaking into the Capitol, historic moment --is that why you were  43 
1 saying, "Fresh patriots to the front"? To further advocate for that historic moment, in 
2 your words? 
3 A The "fresh patriots in the front" I said in a variety of times, and mostly it was 
4 trying to get people help. The time on that video, I was calling for people to come up. 
5 And that's my wrong. I called for people --I was caught up in an emotional moment 
6 where everyone's trying to get inside. And I'm tired of being there. I'm videoing 
7 for --you know, I don't know what's going to happen. 
8 I was also seeing people getting beaten, like, heavily. You know what I mean? 
9 was seeing them getting beaten heavily, the police. I made mention of it. I was like, "I 
10 don't think that they can hold it back. This is crazy." Right? If I'm saying "this is 
11 crazy," I'm not saying this is awesome-crazy; I'm saying this is crazy as in, like, this is nuts. 
12 Right? I say that in the video too. 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A So explain to us how you got out of the tunnel again. 
I climbed out over people. I literally climbed out over people. 
Did your girlfriend's father also climb out with you? 
He never went in. 
Oh. So you left him to go in. 
No. I got separated from him. 
Okay. 
I got pushed in, where he didn't. He was back behind me, below on the 
21 steps. He stopped. I don't know, I think he was, like, looking at his phone or whatever. 
22 
23 Q 
A So tell us about what happened after you left the Capitol that day. 
After I crawled out of the tunnel, I immediately just forced my way past 
24 people. I was covered in stuff, so people were trying to help me. I was covered in this 
25 orange bear spray. I could barely see out of both of my eyes.  44 
1 That was on tape. I came out and I was saying that I was fucked up because I 
2 had been --you know, I was squished, I could barely breathe, my leg was, like, crushed at 
3 one point. I could barely hobble out of there. 
4 And I made my way straight back to the van. I took off my shirt and my 
5 overshirt. Somebody --I was asking people for milk, but they had already given people 
6 milk, I guess. There was people who had brought stuff in backpacks. 
7 
8 And, originally, when I was calling other people up, it was to help other people. 
Q Oh. So when you said "fresh patriots to the front," it was to help other 
9 people? 
10 A Not in that --in that instance. I said it several times. And there was 
11 people who were helping people from the corner where I was at. Because they were 
12 getting crushed and beat by the police. 
13 As a matter of fact, one of those guys --I'm on video. He's being crushed by the 
14 police up front, and I reach down with my hand and try and pull him out from being up on 
15 top, but he was too heavy. He ended up being taken in by the police for medical help. 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 Q Were you there when one of the officers was dragged out into the crowd? 
A I was somewhere there. I think there was --
Q So you saw that happen? 
A What's that? 
Q Did you see that happen? 
A Yeah. That was when I was on the left-hand side, stuck in between people 
22 at the doorway threshold right there. And I think he had been pulled out before I got 
23 pushed out of that corner. But somehow he ended up getting pulled way down. And I 
24 don't think he was the only officer that was pulled out. He was the only one that was 
25 pulled way down there.  45 
1 But, at some point whenever he was there, whether it was him or not, I'm not 
2 exactly sure --I think it was Officer Fa none that I helped, because he was facing 
3 down --but I actually helped him up, back to the police line. Because one of the police 
4 officers said, "Please, can you help me get my friend? Just help me get my friend." 
5 And he, like, was pointing down to this guy who was, like, not far behind me, and he was 
6 down. And there was people around him, and some were pulling in one direction, and 
7 people were trying to help him back up. And so I joined the people trying to help pull 
8 him back to the police line. I remember I had his upper left shoulder, because he was 
9 facing down. And I, like, helped pass him off to the police line. 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 Q Got it. 
Mr- Mr.1111, did you have followup? 
Yeah. 
BY 
Q I just wanted to go back to the "patriots" word. Do you remember why you 
15 used that word, of all words, at the time? 
16 A I don't know. Because, actually, I should've been calling for the medic guys 
17 who were the ones who were helping people. But I was just chaotic. And, you know, 
18 "fresh patriots" --these guys are hurt; I need someone to help me get them, basically. 
19 Like, it was so loud, and I don't even know --no one was ever hearing me anyways. 
20 It was like, I helped, like, one smaller lady myself, and I pulled her out. And that 
21 guy, one of those guys, he was wearing, like, tactical gear and shit and, like, medic-looking 
22 stuff. Like, he looked like a field medic, the way he was dressed, with a bag and stuff. 
23 And he grabbed the one girl and pulled her around the corner, because she was getting 
24 crushed right there and was covered in it and makeup running all down her face. 
25 It was a misuse of words. I don't even know why I used that particular word.  1 
2 Q Did you think that the people --
A There was a lady who was next to me who said, "We need soldiers to the 
3 front" too, so I don't know. 
4 Q Right. But did you think that the people that you were asking to come 
5 forward and help looked like or were acting like patriots at the time? 
6 A I guess it depends on, like, what you're talking --I don't know what you 
7 mean. 
8 Q So you're calling for fresh patriots to the front of the tunnel, where there's 
9 horrible violence going on, right? And people are getting hurt. You're talking about 
10 Officer Fanone with his face down, and you're trying to get him up. 
11 
12 A Right. So if you're actively helping people --
Q So you're in the middle of the violence --right. But I'm asking, like, if the 
13 people who were causing this violence, did they look like patriots to you at the time? 
14 A They looked like everyday, normal people. They looked like you. They 
15 looked like me. They looked like any --what do you mean? They were just wearing 
16 their red MAGA hats. They didn't look like terrorists. They just looked like the same 
17 people I had been standing in lines with and, like, meandering around with --business 
18 owners, veterans. They looked like normal people. They didn't look like --I don't --
19 Q If they looked like normal people, I'm just trying to figure out what 
20 characteristic caused you to use the word "patriots." 
21 A I figured everyone there was a patriot. I would hope that everyone in 46 
22 America is patriotic to their country, you know? I don't know. That's how I was raised, 
23 very patriotically. 
24 
25 Q Understood. 
So, in the moment --or, actually, looking back, would you say that people who  1 were engaged in the violent parts of January 6th were acting patriotically? 
2 
3 
4 
5 A No, I wouldn't. 
Q Okay. Thank you. 
A Yeah, I wouldn't say that at all. 
I think anybody --I wasn't actively --you know what? If you --first off, I know 47 
6 that people pushed their way in for Justice Cavanaugh's hearing in 2016, right? Or 2017. 
7 I know that people are allowed in the Capitol Building for tours daily. I did not 
8 know it was closed off that day. I didn't know that we went over any barricades, 
9 because they had been removed before I got there, okay? 
10 So why would I have any indication --people told me Trump said that he was 
11 going up there, right? What indication would I have that it would be illegal to be on the 
12 Capitol Grounds at the time? Do you know what I mean?

14 Like, if we're looking for, you know, like, motive on my part, I --I --people --
Q Mr. Cantwell, I was not asking --I was specifically asking just about your 
15 choice of the words, and I think --
16 But that's an interesting answer, 
17 BY 
18 Q So it's your testimony here today that when you saw the sea of people and 
19 the police line falling back, that you didn't know that it was illegal to go in the Capitol 
20 Grounds that day? Is that your testimony? 
21 
22 
23 
24 A 
Q 
A 
Q I was already on Capitol Grounds. 
But so you thought that you could continue going on Capitol Grounds --
1 was already on it. No, I mean --
Mr. Cantwell, that's not what I asked you. I asked you, when you saw the 
25 police line fall back, you thought that it was still legal for you to continue walking up the  1 stairs towards the tunnel on the Capitol Grounds. 
2 
3 
4 
5 A 
Q 
A No, I didn't say that. 
I'm asking you, is that your testimony today? 
My testimony is no --wait, what? Yes, I knew that --
Q You said you didn't know. You just said you didn't know. So I'm asking 
6 you, you did not know, when the police line fell back, that you could continue forward, 
7 you didn't know that? 
A What --48 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 Q You can't have it both ways, Mr. Cantwell. You can't say you didn't know --
A 
Q 
A I don't understand. So what you're saying is -­
Please, Mr. Cantwell --
1 told you that there was no indication at the time, when I was there 
13 originally, when I showed up --before showing up. Like, I would've never showed up 
14 had I known that it was illegal, is what I'm saying. 
15 
16 Q Got it. But you also had opportunities to turn back around, is my point. 
A You're right, I did. I had an opportunity to turn back around. I went up 
17 and I videotaped, and I shouldn't have. And then I engaged, and I shouldn't have. 
18 didn't fight, and I didn't destroy property, and I still never went inside. 
19 Q You didn't fight and you didn't --
20 
21 A I used two phrases --
Q Wait. You didn't fight and you didn't destroy property, but you did 
22 encourage others, correct? 
23 
24 A I guess saying "get the door open" is --yes. 
Q That's the only way you can construe it, is encouraging others to get the 
25 door open, correct?  1

7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 A Right. Yeah. 
Q Okay. 
So let's --all right. So take us --then you left the Capitol. Where'd you go? 
A I went back to the van. 
Q And then did you go home that night? 
A I did. 
Q All right. 
So let's --actually, this is for Mr. Cocis. 
What's the status of Mr. Cantwell's case right now? 
I think you're on mute still. 
Mr. Cantwell. Yeah, you're on mute. 
Mr. Cocis. Sorry. He pied, and he has a sentencing in September. 
Gotcha. Okay. Have y'all --you haven't filed any briefs or 
14 anything yet for the sentencing? 
15 
16 Mr. Cocis. Not yet. 
BY 49 
17 Q I guess I want to ask these next questions from the lens of today, right, April 
18 of 2022. What are your thoughts about January 6th now in retrospect? 
19 A January 6th, people should not have fought with police officers to go in. 
20 should not have used encouraging words for other people to go in. When --
21 Q You're being very specific about people shouldn't have fought police. 
22 Should people have gone into the Capitol on January 6th? 
23 A Now that I know that it was not --but, at the time, no, I didn't know that it 
24 was quarantined off at the time. What I'm saying --
25 Mr. Cocis. I think what he's asking you --he said, today, looking back on it, what  1 are your thoughts on January the 6th, people going inside the Capitol? Do you think 
2 that's right? Do you think that's wrong? What are your thoughts on that? 
3 Mr. Cantwell. Well, I don't --
4 
5 
6 that. Mr. Cocis. Looking back. 
Mr. Cantwell. People who fought to go inside, period, should not have done 
7 But there are hundreds of people who were waved into the Capitol Building by 50 
8 Capitol Police. It's on video. And it's now in court, because the judge just acquitted a 
9 man on all charges because the police officer waved him in. So it's not, like, a weird idea 
10 to think that, yeah, people were allowed inside. Because people were physically 
11 allowed inside, and it's proven in court now. 
12 B 
13 Q I want to go back to something we were talking about earlier, because we 
14 were kind of going back and forth about your role. 
15 Your statement of facts specifically states in paragraph 9 (ph) that you encouraged 
16 rioters, correct? 
17 
18 
19 
20 A 
Q 
A 
Q I guess. Yeah. 
Not "I guess." Did you encourage rioters? 
If I said "get the door open," that's encouraging rioters. 
I'm asking a very specific question, not about "get the door open" or 
21 anything else. I'm asking, according to your statement of facts with your guilty plea, you 
22 encouraged rioters on January 6th, correct? 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q Yes. That's --
It's --it's --thank you. 
So, going back, so you said that --you were going on about how folks were waved  51 
1 into the Capitol. So you believe that rioters were waved in the Capitol? That's what 
2 you think in retrospect now, in April of 2022? 
Yeah. It's court fact. So, yeah, I do believe that. 3 
4 A 
Q It's a court fact in one specific case. You are tracking that every other case 
5 they've been found guilty, correct? 
6 A Yeah. There's only been five cases, and those people were idiots, and they 
7 were fighting police. One guy tackled a police officer that's about to go to court now, 
8 so, yeah, he should probably go to jail. Those people are not the people that I'm talking 
9 about. I'm talking about half of the building was let in, and the other half fought their 
10 way in. 
11 So the people that fought their way in, yeah, they're wrong. The other people 
12 who were waved in by police, that doesn't sound wrong. We have a constitutional right 
13 to be able to express our freedom of speech. And they were allowed to do it at the 
14 Cavanaugh hearings. 
15 
16 Mr. Cocis. Easton. 
Mr. Cantwell. And there was 233 people who were arrested then for --and they 
17 were on the left, and they acted stupid, yeah. 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 Mr. Cocis. Easton. 
Mr. Cantwell. What? 
Mr. Cocis. Just answer his question, that's all. You know, yes or no, that's all. 
Mr. Cantwell. I just did. I answered it --
Mr. Cocis. No. 
Mr. Cantwell. --yes, I do, and for what reason. 
Mr. Cocis. Okay. That's okay.

6 Q So, as to your views in April 2022, do you still believe the election was 
A No. 
Q Why have your feelings changed in that regard? 
A Because there has been no significant court cases to indicate such. 
Q Have your views about President Trump changed since the election and 
7 January 6th of 2021? 
8 
9 A No, not particularly. 
Q Okay. 
10 What do you think could've been done differently to prevent January 6th from 
11 occurring? 
12 A By accepting requests for National Guard aid whenever it was time for it, 
13 beforehand, when it was requested. 
14 
15 Q Oh, you're going off news reports? Is that what you're basing that off of? 
A Yeah. I mean, Trump had asked for it, Pelosi had asked for it, the Mayor 
16 had asked for it, right? Like, why wasn't that done? 
17 Real, you know --some way of letting people know for real that there was, 52 
18 like --that you couldn't actually be on the grounds, you know? I mean, they had barriers 
19 up, but they were tore down, right? And then --
20 
21 
22 Q 
A I'm sorry. That's what cuts against -­
--the police --
Q That's what cuts against the answer. There were barriers that showed 
23 people couldn't get on the grounds, but, as you just indicated, they were torn down, so --
24 A Right. And that's what I'm saying. Like, I don't know how you would fix 
25 that, because they were there. Maybe more --maybe betterly manned, had more  53 
1 people there, you know? 
2 I know that they had just been split off --now --that the D.C. police had been split 
3 off to go and deal with the bomb threat at the DNC, if I'm correct. So that had --
4 
5 
6 Q 
A And RNC. 
--diverted resources away from them, you know? 
And, you know, D.C.'s a --I mean, you guys --out in the real world, we think that, 
7 like, you know, like, that's one of the most secure places you can be. So I would've 
8 expected more people if it wasn't --you know what I mean? Just, like, you guys 
9 barricaded it up real good after that. So maybe that's a good idea in the future, you 
10 know? 
11 I mean, I also --I don't know. Because it doesn't want to seem like you're in 
12 some country where you have to be --you shouldn't be fearful of your people. You 
13 know what I mean? 
14 And maybe having, I don't know, something --what was --I had an actual idea for 
15 that, ways to have stopped this. I think having people have been heard completely. 
16 You know, if there's 70-something-million people who think that the election's stolen, 
17 sloughing them off is not necessarily the best of ideas, and just saying that, "Oh, this 
18 video that you can see with your own eyes doesn't exist, and we're not going to 
19 acknowledge that it exists," you know, when we can all see it. 
20 Yeah, I mean, you can argue what happens here and there in the news, you know, 
21 this guy's perspective or this person's. But a video where we can actually see things 
22 happening, and then telling us that that's not real and that we're conspiracy theorists for 
23 even mentioning that we saw it --and me, personally, it wouldn't matter. If Trump won 
24 by cheating, then I wouldn't want him to be there either. If anybody did, you know? 
25 And as a patriotic American, when you see these things and you think that that's  54 
1 the truth --the President of the United States is telling you that the vote was stolen, 
2 right? And then there's Senators that back it up and Governors in certain States that 
3 back that up, in the States that are swing States. 
4 So, you know, I don't know how you could ever really stop it, other than upping 
5 security, you know, making it to where people just can't go in there. 
6 Q So I want to --that's an interesting point you brought up just now. Did the 
7 President and the Senators and the Congressmen that you just mentioned, did they 
8 influence your thoughts on the fact that the election might've been stolen or there were 
9 irregularities? 
10 A Yeah, I mean, those all go hand-in-hand with all the video evidence and the 
11 articles and this and that, you know, here and there. 
12 Q I hear that, and I hear the articles and the videos that purport to show what 
13 you're saying. But I guess I'm just curious about what role our leaders of our country 
14 played in furthering your views on that regard. 
15 A Yeah, I mean, isn't that what you're supposed to do, is trust the people that 
16 are elected? 
17 I mean, I don't know any other --anybody who's served in the military, the 
18 President of the United States is the Commander in Chief, right? Like, he's the boss, you 
19 know? I mean, he's not, like, the king, but, you know, if he's out on TV telling the world 
20 that it was stolen, what else would I believe, as a patriotic American who voted for him 
21 and wants to continue to see the country thrive as I thought it was? You know? 
22 don't know. 
23 
24 
25 All right. Well, that's all I have. 
Thank you for taking the time to meet with us here today. 
Thank you, Mr. Cocis, for -- 1 Mr. Cocis. You're welcome.
