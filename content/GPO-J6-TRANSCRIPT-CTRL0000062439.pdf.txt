- We are on the record at 10:10 a.m. 1 
2 
3 Good morning. This is a deposition of David Scott Kuntz conducted by the House 
4 Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol 
5 pursuant to House Resolution 503. 
6 Mr. Kuntz, please state your full name and spell your last name for the record. 
7 The Witness. David Scott Kuntz, K-u-n-t-z. 
8 - Thank you very much. Would you please raise your right hand so 
9 that the court reporter can swear you in. 
10 The Reporter. Do you solemnly declare and affirm under the penalty of perjury 
11 that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing 
12 but the truth? 
13 The Witness. I do. 
14 - Thank you very much. 
15 This will be a staff-led deposition and members, of course, may choose to also ask 
16 questions, although I don't see any with us at the time. 
17 My name is I'm an investigative counsel with the select committee. 
18 And on Webex with me is_, also an investigative counsel. He is also remote. 
19 So if you see his nice-looking face pop up on the screen, he might have a question and I'll 
20 recognize him. 
21 And for this deposition, we will follow the House deposition rules that we 
22 provided to your counsel previously. Under the House deposition rules, you are 
23 permitted to have an attorney present. 
24 Mr. Kuntz, at this time, I'm going to ask your counsel to please state his name for 
25 the record.  1 
2 Mr. Wiest. Chris Wiest, representing Mr. Kuntz in this matter. 
- Thank you, Mr. Wiest. 
3 Under the House deposition rules, neither committee members nor staff may 
4 discuss the substance of testimony you provide today unless the committee approves 
5 release. You and your attorney will have an opportunity to review the transcript. But 
6 before we begin, I'd like to describe a few ground rules. 
7 There is an official reporter transcribing the record of this deposition. The 
8 reporter also is joining us by Webex. So please wait until each question is completed 
9 before you begin your response, and we will try to wait until your response is complete 
10 before we ask our next question. It's just really hard over virtual for the reporters to 
11 hear two --or to understand two voices talking at the same time. So I'll do my best and 
12 please do your best as well. Thank you. 
13 And the reporter cannot record nonverbal responses such as shaking your head, 
14 so it is important that you answer each question with an audible verbal response. And 4 
15 for the benefit of the reporter and the record, there may be times where I spell a name or 
16 a word that we are using, or I ask that you do the same. 
17 And we ask that you provide complete answers, based on your best recollection. 
18 If the question is not clear, which certainly might happen, just please ask me for 
19 clarification. And if you don't know the answer, please simply say so. 
20 And just in terms of logistics, if you need a break for comfort or to talk to 
21 Mr. Beast about anything, just let us know. We'll go, you know, off camera. We'll go 
22 mute so that you can have whatever time that you need. 
23 And today, we're going to be showing you some exhibits as we move along, and 
24 those will be displayed on the screen in front of you. And when we refer you to a 
25 document, you can take some time to familiarize yourself with it before we discuss it.  1 And just to test out the system here, I'm going to bring up exhibit 1. All right. 
2 Do you recognize exhibit 1, Mr. Kuntz? 
3 The Witness. Yes. 
4 - It's the subpoena and the accompanying documents that the select 
5 committee issued to you. 
6 
7 The Witness. Yes, sir. 
- Thank you. So during this deposition, you may only refuse to 5 
8 answer a question --sorry. I am also doing the exhibits, so there might be a little bit of a 
9 pause as I bring them up and take them down. 
10 But during this deposition, you may only refuse to answer a question to preserve a 
11 privilege recognized by the select committee. If you refuse to answer a question based 
12 on a privilege, staff may either proceed with the deposition or seek a ruling from the 
13 chairman on the objection. If the chairman overrules such an objection, you are 
14 required to answer the question. 
15 And at this time, I would ask Mr. Wiest to please place on the record any 
16 objections or to make any opening remarks he may have. 
17 Mr. Wiest. I suspect we may get into objections and privilege issues, you know, 
18 either --hopefully not anything attorney-client, but possibly Fifth Amendment. We'll 
19 deal with those as those come up. We do not intend to raise a general objection. 
20 - I appreciate it. Thank you. 
21 So I want to remind you, Mr. Kuntz, as we do with all witnesses, that it is unlawful 
22 to deliberately provide false information to Congress. Since this deposition is under 
23 oath, providing false information could result in criminal penalties, to include for perjury 
24 and/or providing false statements. 
25 Do you understand?  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 The Witness. Yes, sir. 
- Thank you very much.

No, Harrison, H-a. Yes, sir. 
Thank you. Were you ever in the military? 
No, sir. 
Appreciate it. Thank you. 
Are you aware of a group known as the Three Percenters? 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Yes, sir. 
How did you become aware of them? 
A few friends. 
Through some friends. Do you consider yourself a member of any Three 
12 Percenter group? 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
Okay. 
A Yes. 
Which one? 
Grey Ghost Partisan. 
Just that one or others? 
No. We're affiliated with Central Kentucky. 
What is Central Kentucky? 
They're a Three Percenter group, too. 
Okay. So the group name is Central Kentucky Three Percenters? 
Yes, sir. Sorry about that. 
Oh, no, that's okay. I was just making sure I didn't miss something. 
So what drew you to want to be part of the Three Percenters? 
Just --I don't know. It's been so long since I've done it. I mean, it's --we 
25 get together, you know, good hangouts in the mountains. You know, we do some 7  8 
1 shooting, you know, target practice, camping, you know, do a little rappelling, stuff like 
2 that. 
3 I mean, it's, you know --it's general stuff and it's just --I've been stuck with it ever 
4 since. You know, good people. You know, it's just a fun time. You know, we all get 
5 together and just have a good time. 
6 Q So it sounds like a bit of --there's some social aspect to it, but what is the 
7 ideology or the idea of the group? Like, what brings everybody together to be a Three 
8 Percenter? 
10 
11 
12 
13 guess. A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Everybody has their own --their own opinion about it, of what it's for, I 
So what does it mean to you, Mr. Kuntz? 
Is it what now? 
Sorry. What does a Three Percenter mean to you? 
As a, I guess, defender of people's rights and the Constitution. 
And how does a Three Percenter do that? 
Protect people's rights whenever there's --like if a --like a store or 
17 something wants us to come down and protect it during riots or something like that, we 
18 go down there and we protect that store, that property. Just people in general, that 
19 during the riots that people aren't like beat up or, you know, or serious injuries or 
20 anything like that. 
21 
22 
23 
24 Q 
A 
Q 
A And how do you provide --I'm sorry. Go ahead. 
No, that's it. 
Okay. And how do you provide that protection? 
We just show up to make sure everybody's, you know, protected, that 
25 nothing bad is happening to anybody.  1 
2 
3 
4 Q 
A 
Q 
A When you say you just show up, do you show up in a group? 
Yes. 
Okay. And do you bring anything with you? 
It just depends on the situation that's --that's at hand. If there's a lot 
5 of --if --like if the rioters have weapons or something like that, then yes, we bring our 
6 gear with us. 
7 
8 Q 
A And when you say gear, can you describe that for me? 
Like our --bring our plate carriers, sidearm, our rifles. Just, I guess, normal 
9 gear, you know, for different situations. Sorry. 
10 - That's okay. ■■■ l do you have a follow-up? 
11 - Yes, I have a couple of follow-ups. Thank you, -
12 BY-: 
13 Q So mentioned if the rioters have weapons you would bring your 
14 gear as well. How do you know if the rioters are going to have weapons before you 
15 attend an event? 
16 A Well, we see them like on TV or social media and stuff first before --before 
17 we appear. You know, we want to see how --what they have and how they're acting. 
18 Q So what indications would tell you it was necessary to bring equipment, 
19 including sidearms, as you mentioned? 9 
20 A Like BLM or something like downtown Louisville or something like is the only 
21 way I can describe it is we know that they have security details with them fully armed as 
22 well. So we already know this. So we show up for self-defense, but do not engage 
23 them in any hostile manners or anything. 
24 BY-
25 Q Can I ask where you get your intel from?  10 
1 A Like, social media type stuff. Friends will post it or they'll call and say, Hey, 
2 you know, this is going on right now, let's go. We're going to go down there for a 
3 little --you know, and bring your gear. It's just --it's --I don't know. It's just --1 don't 
4 know. It's really kind of hard to describe. You just see it or somebody calls you or 
5 something like that. It's --because they don't --I mean, they don't hide it. They show 
6 it. 
7 BY-: 
8 Q So I know you just mentioned going down for self-defense, but obviously, 
9 you're going down to where the armed groups might be, so you're actively seeking out 
10 those situations that you mentioned to protect others. But to me, that seems like 
11 something that law enforcement would be tasked with. 
12 Why do Three Percenter groups or the Three Percenter group you were involved 
13 with want to do that when law enforcement, at least in the traditional view, would be 
14 doing that? 
15 A We are --we don't go down there to engage them in any --we are 
16 down --we stand more --okay. Like, for instance, a year and a half, last summer maybe, 
17 we protected a gas station. You know, we protected the property of a gas station, a 
18 pawn shop, a couple pawn shops, really, and some hotels in a general area, just to make 
19 sure that they wasn't burned down, destroyed or any of that type stuff. 
20 We don't really engage these people, you know, at any point. We have --we did 
21 one time downtown Louisville, just --you know, just, I don't know, shake them up a little 
22 bit or something, let them know, Hey, you know, there are other people here. 
23 
24 Q 
A So when you say "shake them up," what do you mean by that? 
Just to show them that there's other, like, groups that don't want the 
25 violence and don't want buildings or property destroyed and all that. So we marched in  11 
1 with them to make sure that there was no trouble. 
2 And there was no trouble. I mean, there was some words or stuff like that, but I 
3 think it was a good thing. Nothing happened in Louisville after that, you know. A lot 
4 of --it mainly has been peaceful-type stuff and it's great. That's what we like to see. 
5 Q Certainly. So before these kind of events where you'd go down to protect a 
6 gas station or a shop, would you communicate your intentions to law enforcement or 
7 have any other kind of coordination with law enforcement? 
8 
9 
10 A 
Q 
A They knew we were there, yes. 
And how would they typically know that? 
I don't know all the details of it, but I know that somebody was in contact 
11 with one of the higher-ups down there, letting them know every time that we were there. 
12 And every time that we were done and we left, we would --that person would inform 
13 them. Now, what they talked about or anything, I don't know. 
14 Q Was that something that had been done for many events or was it more 
15 specifically centered around the summer of 2020, the law enforcement liaison? 
16 
17 
18 A 
Q 
A You're talking about like other things going on? 
Yes. 
Yeah. We would generally inform any of the, like, sheriff's departments or 
19 city police that we were --we were going to be there in the events. And they okayed 
20 and they were with it, never gave us any trouble. We never gave them any trouble. So 
21 they were okay with it. Always informed when we went in. 
22 Q And if there was a perceived need to bring weapons or other equipment, 
23 would you tell the law enforcement that as well? 
24 
25 A 
Q Yes, sir. They were well aware. 
As far as you knew, there was never any objections lodged by law  12 
1 enforcement to those activities? 
2 
3 A 
Q No, sir, never. 
And during the events themselves, did you ever interact with law 
4 enforcement? 
5 
6 A 
Q Yes. 
How so? 
7 A In like your --not general like --like your --like the big city, like Louisville, we 
8 didn't interact with them. They kind of stayed to theirself, we stayed to ourself, but 
9 they knew where we was at all times. 
10 The smaller towns, some of the officers, you know, would come in, you know, and 
11 say, Hey, how you all doing or something like that. It wasn't nothing like a coordinated 
12 thing or something, like, I guess. 
13 
14 Q 
A Sure. That makes sense. 
It was just a Hi, Hey, how you guys doing, you know. That's basically it. 
15 Q That is helpful. One more question. It's a little broader --before I turn it 
16 back to-· How did you view the Three Percenters' relationship with law 
17 enforcement, or your role compared to law enforcement as you attended these events? 
18 Mr. Wiest. He asked how did you view your role vis-a-vis law enforcement? 
19 Like, how did you interact with them? What was your role versus theirs? 
20 The Witness. Oh, you talking about like --like I said, you know, the crowds, you 
21 know, just to make sure that people kept between both sides. If --like if somebody was 
22 attacked and, I don't know, if law enforcement wasn't close enough to react, we could 
23 maybe step in and help, like separate the parties, you know, just to keep the peace 
24 between --between everybody. 
25 Because everybody has their own, you know, views of everything. So we don't  13 
1 judge on their view or our views or anything like that. We just want to make sure that 
2 everything is peaceful and everybody go about their day. That's what it's all about. 
3 - Got it. Thank you. I'll turn it back to - but looking forward 
4 to more questions. 
5 
6 
7 - Thankyou, 
BY-
Q So you keep mentioning the "we," which I find interesting. How is the 
8 group organized? So how --let's start with the Grey Ghost Three Percenters. Was 
9 there a formal organization? 
10 A What do you mean a formal organization? Just like --it's just a group of 
11 guys that --in a group that hang out. 
12 
13 Q 
A How did you join the group? 
I think I met --don't quote me on this. I'm not really exactly positive, but I 
14 think it was during an event downtown Louisville that I met with the --I guess he's the 
15 CO, I guess. I don't call him CO. I just call him a friend. 
16 Q So there is a leader of this group, someone who calls --does he represent 
17 himself as the CO? 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 A Yes. 
Q And what is his name? 
A It's Mike Cole. 
Q Can you spell that? 
A It's Mike, M-i-k-e, C-o-1-e. 
Q Thank you. So was there any formal application that you had to do to join 
24 the group after you met with Mr. Cole? 
25 A No, sir.  14 
No dues? 
No. No, there was nothing like that. 1 
2 
3 Q 
A 
Q Did you have a weekly meeting or was it just whenever you all wanted to get 
4 together? 
5 A It's whenever everybody wants to get together, but we try to do it like once 
6 a month, just, you know, get together and camp out in the woods or, you know, just 
7 normal guy stuff, I guess. 
8 
9 Q 
A Did you ever do any trainings together? 
Yeah. We shot and --you know, shoot and stuff like that. We got targets 
10 and, you know, stuff like that. We don't do any type of, I don't know, aggressive-type 
11 training. I mean, we might set up some, you know, thing to walk through or something 
12 like that, but it's not no aggressive-type stuff. 
13 Q So I'm going to show you my lack of law enforcement experience. Can you 
14 explain the difference between the trainings that you did and what you were saying were 
15 more serious? 
16 A Normal law enforcement. I was more a Reserve than --I didn't go to the 
17 Academy, okay. I was more of a Reserve. It was your basic kind of like stuff we do 
18 now. It's just your normal --your target practice with your right hand and switch to your 
19 left. It's like move to this to shoot and then move to this area to shoot and then switch 
20 up type stuff, some hand-to-hand stuff, baton-training, pepper spray-training and 
21 taser-training stuff. 
22 
23 
24 
25 Q 
A 
Q 
A Understood. So were you training in military formations at all? 
On --through law enforcement? 
Sorry. With the Grey Ghost group. 
I don't know if you'd call it military. I mean, like if we was going to go down  15 
1 the street or something like that we would --you know, we'd walk, I don't know, kind of 
2 staggered. I don't know if you call that military stuff or not. We just staggered up on 
3 each side of the road. 
4 Q But in your words and as I take it, you weren't doing sort of advanced, more 
5 tactical training when you met up. It was more target practice, some hand-to-hand 
6 stuff, basic walking? 
7 A Not in our group. You know, we don't do any of that hand-to-hand type 
8 stuff. That was just law enforcement side. 
9 
10 Q 
A Got it. 
With, you know, the self-defense class, I think, is what they referred it to. 
11 But on our side, no, we don't do stuff like that. We just --
12 
13 Q 
A Okay. 
We get together and camp out in the woods and some target practice, or go 
14 rappel or something like that. That's --that's about it. 
15 Q Appreciate it. And how did you communicate about these, you know, 
16 getting together? Did you use messaging apps? 
17 
18 
19 A 
Q 
A Like Telegram or something, they got like a little site. 
Yes. 
Get together on --our training on the first of the month or, Hey, we're going 
20 to do some rappelling this weekend, you all want to come down. Just like that. 
21 Q So I'm going to pull up exhibit 3, which is something you provided to us. 
22 Give me one second. Okay. 
23 
24 
25 So this --can you all see exhibit 3? 
A 
Q Yes, sir. 
It looks like a chat labeled Kentucky Horses and Asses with 75 members.  16 
1 This was a screenshot that you provided to us. Is this the Telegram chat that you used 
2 with the Grey Ghost group? 
Yes, sir. 3 
4 A 
Q Great. So I'm just going to --I'll pause here and take a little sidetrack for a 
5 second, and we do this with all witnesses, but we just have to check for the record to 
6 make --you know, ask you some questions about document production. 
7 Did you search through your personal email for any responsive documents to the 
8 subpoena? 
9 
10 A 
Q Yes. 
Thank you. And you provided the screenshot of the chat. Did you try to 
11 log back into chat messages? 
12 
13 A 
Q 
14 responsive? 
15 
16 
17 
18 A 
Q 
A 
Q What does he mean? 
Sorry. Did you try to access your chat messages for messages that are 
Yeah. For this? 
Yeah. Just in general, for all your documents. 
Yes. 
Okay. So in terms of this particular screenshot then, was this just 
19 something you had on your phone, the screenshot, and you could not access the full 
20 chat? 
21 A No, sir. I went back through the phone all the way back. It took me 
22 like --like 2 hours to get to that point. And that's as far as back as it will let me go. 
23 
24 
25 Q Okay. So all the messages before that were deleted? 
Mr. Wiest. Do you know the answer to that? 
BY- 1 
2 Q 
A You could not access the messages before this? 
No. It won't go back any further. That's it. That's as far as back as it 
3 would let me go. 
4 Q Understood. Did you try to log onto Telegram on a computer, like a 
5 personal computer? 
6 
7 
8 A No, just --just my phone. I just used my phone. 
Q Okay. 
- Mr. Wiest, we might talk after this about whether that's possible. 17 
9 know it can be sometimes. I'm not sure in this case it is possible. I'm not representing 
10 that you were not responsive to the subpoena, but we can talk after if you'd like. Is that 
11 okay? 
12 Mr. Wiest. I think we can. I think he has undertaken an exhaustive effort to 
13 produce documents in part of my instruction, and I don't think there's anything further 
14 that can be accessed, but we can have a further conversation if you'd like. 
15 - Yes. And I'd like to reiterate, I am not suggesting that you did not 
16 do an exhaustive search and that you produced what you had found, but technology can 
17 be sometimes complicated, so we'll touch base after. 
18 But thank you very much, Mr. Kuntz.

9 apps like with other members of the Grey Ghost group?

11 A 
Q Honestly, I don't think so. I don't really remember, but I don't think so. 
I appreciate it. Did you have a social --was there like a social media page 
12 for the Grey Ghost group? 18 
13 A No, just that, what's up there. I mean, it wasn't no --you talking about like 
14 our own site type thing or --
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 Q Yeah. 
A No. 
Q Like a Face book page or whatever. 
A No. I --no. 
Q Okay. Thank you. You mentioned a Mr. Cole before. Can you tell me a 
20 little bit more about him. Does he live in Indiana? 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 A No, sir. He lives in Kentucky. 
Q And do you know what he does for a living? 
A I think he's retired. 
Q Did he ever, like, explain to you how he started the Grey Ghost group? 
A I'm not --I'm not really --I'm not really sure 100 percent how he come up  19 
1 with that name or whatever, you know, because we were all together, and then I think it 
2 was just a name that he come up with for us, you know, because we were always hanging 
3 together. 
4 Q Oh, so when you mentioned him being the CO, the name Grey Ghost hadn't 
5 been established yet when you joined? 
6 
7 
8 
9 A No, I don't think so. 
Q So why did you call Mike the CO then? 
A I didn't call him --
Q Not you, sorry. Why did he call himself the CO before there was the name 
10 of the Grey Ghost? 
11 A He was the creator of the Grey Ghost. So, I mean, it's --we --I mean, we 
12 look at it as, you know, he's the creator of it, so he would be the CO. That's the best I 
13 can describe it. 
14 Q So when you met Mr. Cole, did he call himself the CO of, like, a Three 
15 Percenter group or did that come later? 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 A Later. 
Q So that came later? 
A I think that came much later. 
Q Do you remember when that was, about when? 
A No, sir, I do not. 
Q Totally fine. Thank you. 
22 Does the Grey Ghost group --I know you mentioned the Central Kentucky Three 
23 Percenters, but does Grey Ghost ever associate with Oath Keepers? 
24 
25 A We --can I take a sec? I mean --
Q Yes. Do you want a couple minutes to talk to Mr. Wiest?  1 
2 A Hang on. Yes, sir. 
- Let's go for a quick recess at 10:40. You should mute and turn off 
3 your video, though. 
4 [Recess.] 
5 
6 
7 - We'll go back on the record, 10:42.

Q I think I had asked you before whether the Grey Ghost Patriot Rangers had 
8 associated with the Oath Keepers? 
9 A Yes, sir. Sorry about that. I didn't really understand that. But no, we 
10 are not affiliated or associated with them in any way. 
11 Q I appreciate it. Just let me know if you don't understand a question. I'll 
12 rephrase. 
13 Did the Grey Ghost Patriot Rangers ever work with the Oath Keepers? 
14 
15 
16 A Yes, we have one time. 
Q When was that? 
A It was during an event downtown Louisville when like the gas station, the 20 
17 pawn shop, taking care of those properties. We were asked to help with manpower to 
18 protect those properties. And other than that, that's the only time we've ever dealt 
19 with them. That's the only --
20 Q How did the Oath Keepers ask you? 
21 A That I'm not aware of, on how they communicate or anything. I was just 
22 asked to come down. 
23 
24 
25 Q Who asked you? 
A I really don't remember. 
Q But do you remember whether an Oath Keeper asked you directly or an Oath  21 
1 Keeper asked Mr. Cole to ask the whole group? 
A They didn't ask me directly, no. 
Q So they asked Mr. Cole? 
A I don't know if it was --if it was Cole or not. I don't know, I really don't. 2 
3 
4 
5 Q That's okay. In terms of what happened at Louisville, do you remember the 
6 Oath Keepers sort of --I don't know a better way to put it --like, kicking out certain 
7 groups who were trying to provide defense? Like, the Oath Keepers, did they ever try to 
8 tell certain groups to leave who had come to provide defense? 
9 
10 A I don't think so. 
Q So you didn't see them telling other groups like yourself, other Three 
11 Percenters or other people who had come to help defend buildings, to get out of 
12 Louisville? 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 A No, sir. 
Q Thank you. 
A Yes, sir. 
Q And do you personally affiliate with the Oath Keepers? 
A Do I personally? 
Q Yes. 
A No, sir, I do not. 
Q How about the Proud Boys? 
A No, sir, I don't. 
Q Have you heard of a group called the First Amendment Praetorian? 
A No, I don't think so. 
Q Okay. Do you associate with other militias --or groups? Sorry, let's just 
25 say other groups.  1 
2 
3 A 
Q 
A Like talk to them or whatever? 
Do you consider yourself to be, you know, a member in other groups? 
No, not member. I mean, we have conversations, you know, with other 
4 groups on social media type stuff. It ain't --we're not like a combined, you know, like 
5 group. It's not nothing like that. 
6 
7 
8 
9 Q 
A 
Q 
A Which groups do you have conversations with? 
Just --let's see. Like the Central Kentucky AAF. 
What does AAF stand for? 
American Action Force I think is how they put it. Those are basically the 22 
10 only people I really talk to unless they're like on a --like a chat or something. I mean, it 
11 ain't --I don't know how --I really don't know how to explain it. 
12 It's not --it's just on a social plat --you know, where everybody talks. I don't 
13 really know the names of, you know, if they have groups or, you know, because a lot of 
14 people, I guess, represent themselves as Three Percenters and, you know, and then not 
15 be affiliated with the group, I guess the best way to --to describe it. So that's the best 
16 way I know how to describe it, man. I don't know any other way to say it. 
17 Q I understand. In terms of your interactions with the American Action 
18 Force, do you know where they're located? 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A They are Indiana. Indiana -­
And --oh, go ahead. 
No, it's just Indiana, Kentucky, I think is how they do it. 
And they are also a Three Percenter group? 
Yes, sir. 
I forgot to ask this, but Central Kentucky is also a Three Percenter, correct? 
Yes, sir.  23 
1 Q So the three, those three groups, when you say you talk to them mostly on 
2 social media or most often on social media, do you all share like a specific chat or is it just 
3 general conversation? 
4 A Like they'll have --I don't know. I guess like Kentucky Horses and Asses, 
5 they --they have their own little like talk thing for their group or something, and 
6 then --but Central, they're just --they use our platforms, I guess, that Telegram Kentucky 
7 Horses and Asses. 
8 
9 Q 
A Have you heard of something called Sons of Liberty Reaper Crew? 
I've heard of Sons of Liberty. Now, as far as who they are or what they're 
10 with or nothing, no, I do not know them personally. 
11 
12 
13 me. 
14 Q 
A 
Q So do you know who Ellen Ha non is? 
No, I do not. Not that I am aware of. I don't --the name doesn't recall 
That's fine. I'll pull up exhibit 2 on page 4. I think Mr. Wiest represented 
15 to me that you lost access to social media, so we have some of your old posts here and a 
16 Ms. Ha non on November 10th responded to your post where you say, "Everyone will 
17 know my name one day, I am the reaper," with what looks to be a Meme called Sons of 
18 Liberty established 1765, Reaper Crew. What is --
19 A That's just like a sticker that somebody made up. You know how you can 
20 go in and bring up different type things. It's not a --it's not a group. It's just a --how 
21 do you say this? You can go in and there will be, like, different types of reapers in there 
22 and different sayings and stuff like that. 
23 
24 
25 that is. Q 
A It's a Meme? 
Yeah. It's not a --it's not a group or nothing like that. That's not what  1 
2 
3 Q 
A 
Q So what is the significance of the reaper? 
It's --I just think it's cool, I mean. 
Do a lot of people talk together about the reaper? So it seems like 
4 Ms. Ha non said "Reaper Crew." I mean, is there like a group of people online who all 
5 associate around the reaper that you know of? 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 rights. A 
Q No, not that I know of. 
Great. Just one more question, then I'm going to give it over to-. 
Would you consider Grey Ghost Kentucky Patriot Rangers to be a militia? 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Yeah. 
And why would you say that they are a militia? 
That's what my CO calls it. That's the only way I can describe it. 
So what does a militia mean to you? 
Just --just like people who guard the Constitution and believe in people's 
Does being a militia have anything to do with the training that you do? 
I don't --I don't really know. Like I said, we just get together and, you 
17 know, just have fun together and just do different things. I mean, that's the way I look 
18 at it. I don't look at it as --as a militia or whatever. I just see a bunch of guys get 
19 together and just have fun on the weekends. 
20 Q Right. But a lot of guys get together a lot of times, and I would hope that 
21 most Americans want to defend constitutional rights and protect people, but not every 24 
22 group of people hanging out would call themselves a militia. So I'm wondering why you 
23 would call the Gray Ghost a militia. 
24 A I don't call them that. Now, my CO says he's militia. I don't --I've never 
25 heard him say we're militia, not that I'm aware of. I mean, he always says he's militia.  25 
1 So, I mean, I don't know. We --I don't --I really don't know why he calls it that. But 
2 that's just him. 
3 I'm not saying I've never said it, you know, kidding around or something like that, 
4 but --you know, to appease him or whatever, but I just don't --I just don't look at it like 
5 that, I really don't. 
6 Q Do you think it has to do with, you know, target practice and the other small 
7 shooting trainings that you all do? 
8 A Do we consider that? We just do it whenever we show up, just something 
9 to do. You know, if the wives are there or if kids come, you know, we let them shoot at 
10 targets and, you know, just --
11 Q Right, but do you think Mr. Cole uses the term "militia," in part, because of 
12 those types of trainings? 
13 A I don't --I don't believe so, but I know he's been in other groups. So maybe 
14 that's how --why he does --says that, but I really don't know. 
15 
16 
17 
18 Q 
A 
Q I appreciate it. I'm sorry, one second. 
You're okay. 
I lost my voice over the weekend. That was fun. 
Do the Gray Ghost Patriot Rangers, do they --I know I asked about the Oath 
19 Keepers. Have they ever worked with Proud Boys? 
20 A I don't think so. I never, I mean, really have worked with them. I mean, 
21 no, not as far as --are you talking about helping them or --
22 Q The same way you described working together with the Oath Keepers on 
23 something, so --
24 A No. I mean, we've been in the same areas that they've been in. We've 
25 never actually worked together or anything like that.  26 
1 Q You didn't communicate ahead of time when you were in the same area as 
2 them, did you? 
A What is it? 3 
4 Q Did you communicate with the Proud Boys ahead of time before you were in 
5 the same area as them? 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 A No. 
Q And aside from --
A I never did. 
Q I'm sorry, what? 
A I never have. 
Q That's all you can answer for. Thank you. 
And in terms of other militias, you talked about the socialization with Central 
13 Kentucky and the AAF. Did the Grey Ghost militia work with them on anything? 
14 A Just --I mean, we were together like downtown. I think they might have 
15 had one or two guys there, you know, just to help out, but that was only for like a night. 
16 But it's not nothing --I mean, if we ask them for help, Hey, can you come help us with this 
17 rally or something or, you know, but other than that, no, it's nothing. 
18 
19 
20 
21 so. 
22 
23 
24 
25 Q Understood. Thank you. 
Any other militias that Grey Ghost Patriot Rangers have worked with? 
A Not that I'm aware of, other than them. I really don't know. I don't think 
Q Okay. Thank you very much. --- Thank you,_ 
BY-:  1 
2 when Q I had a couple of questions to follow up on those points. And I noticed 
asked you if you were affiliated with the Oath Keepers and the Proud 
3 Boys, you gave a pretty quick response both times. 
4 I wonder is there a reason why you aren't associated with the Oath Keepers? 
5 A Just I have no desire, you know, to be affiliated with them. I mean, I'm 
6 happy with the guys that I'm around, you know. It's --it's --I have no desire to be with 
7 Oath Keepers, never have. 27 
8 Q What do you see as the difference between your organization and the Oath 
9 Keepers? 
10 A From what I understand, the Oath Keepers get paid to do events or to 
11 protect, like, buildings and stuff like that. They get paid for that stuff. We don't. We 
12 just --I look at us as just a bunch of guys that hang out to have fun on the weekend, one 
13 weekend a month. 
14 
15 Q 
A Got it. And what about the Proud Boys? 
I mean, I know they're --honestly, I don't know much about them other than 
16 I know they show up to a lot of protests and whatever, just stuff I see. I don't know any 
17 personally. 
18 Q Do you see any ideological differences between your Three Percenter group 
19 and the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys? 
20 A From what I seen is the PBs are totally different than what we are. They go 
21 in, I guess, to fight or whatever. The Oath Keepers are for guarding and protecting 
22 buildings and stuff like that, events that they're paid. 
23 And we're just, you know, if we're asked to help type. You know, we'll --we'll go 
24 down and help them, you know, if they ask or somebody asks us to come down, you 
25 know, but that's the difference I see, is just help, just to help.  1 Q And when you are involved in similar events with these other groups, did 
2 you see any shared mission or shared vision that you all had as to why you were there? 
3 A No, I don't think so. It's just --the only thing I can think of is that we're 
4 there just to keep the peace. Other than that, I mean, that's about the only thing I can 
5 say. You know, we --I don't know. That's about the best I could say is just to make 
6 sure the peace was kept and that's it. I mean, it's a good thing. So everybody wants 
7 peace. 
8 Q That's helpful. Thank you. 
9 - Back to you, 
10 - Thank you, 
11 BY-
12 Q So I'm going to move us to talking about specific events, starting in 
13 November 2020 and moving on through January 2021. For now, we're going to be in 
14 November of 2020. 
15 Did you believe that the 2020 election was stolen? 
16 Mr. Wiest. I'm sorry. Did you ask whether he believes that today or whether 
17 he believed it --
18 
19 - At the time. At the time. 
The Witness. At that time, I really don't know what I thought, you know, about 
20 that. I really still don't to this day, I mean, really. 
21 
22 Q BY-
Did you start participating in any rallies about stopping the steal or 
23 supporting President Trump after the election? 
24 
25 A No. Are you talking about being at a rally? 
Q Yes. 28  29 
1 A I mean, we was --we was there for the rallies in D.C. Yeah, we were there. 
2 Q So why did you attend those --we'll start with the November 14th rally. 
3 Why did you attend that rally? 
4 A To hear Trump speak. And then, I think there was some other speakers 
5 there or something that day. I'm not really 100 percent with who was all there, who 
6 spoke or any of that. 
7 Q And we're talking about the November 14, 2020, rally. I don't believe 
8 President Trump --well, actually, I can represent to you President Trump did not speak at 
9 that rally. Was it your expectation that he would have spoken? 
10 A I would say probably yes. I mean, I'm not 100 percent sure, but I think I 
11 thought that he was supposed to speak then. 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 14th? 
21 
22 Q Do you remember where you learned about the event? 
A On social media, I think, is where we --where I seen it at. 
Q Do you remember if it was a group called Women for America First? 
A I don't remember. 
Q That's okay. If you don't remember, you don't remember. 
Does the name Ali Alexander ring a bell? 
A 
Q 
A 
Q I don't think so. 
Do you remember seeing anything that Alex Jones posted about November 
No, I don't remember that. 
Do you have any sort of recollection about what you were seeing on social 
23 media that told you about November 14th? 
24 
25 A Honestly, no, I don't. 
Q Okay.  1 
2 A I really don't. 
Q That's completely fine. And you mentioned that "we" went. So did you 
3 go with other people to the November 14th rally? 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 A Yeah, I went with a friend. 
Q Is this friend part of the --sorry, go ahead. 
A Sorry. He drove. 
Q Was he a member of the Grey Ghost Patriot militia? 
A Yes. 
Q And what is his name? 
A Dan Wire. 
Q 
A Dan Wire. Anyone else go with you guys? 
I don't think so in November. Was it November? I can't remember if it 
13 was November or December. My --a friend went with me. She's a girl. She went 
14 with us. Chrissie I think is her name, I think. 
15 Q So Chrissie either went with you in November or December, you just can't 
16 remember? 
A Yeah. 30 
17 
18 Q That's okay. Did you coordinate with anyone else besides Dan Wire about 
19 going to D.C. in November? 
20 
21 
22 A 
Q 
A No. 
Did you meet up with anybody there? 
No. No, I don't think so. I don't think. I'm not sure what all happened 
23 on that date. It's been so long. I don't want to say yes, no, this is what or --I 
24 really --honestly, I do not know. 
25 Q That's okay. So the questions are to the best of your recollection. And if  1 you can't remember, you can't remember. That's okay. 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 A 
Q I apologize. 
Thank you. 
Did you expect any sort of violence to occur in November 2020 at the rally? 
A 
Q No, sir. 
I'm going to share exhibit 2, page 5, if I do this correctly. So this page has 
7 two Facebook posts by you. The first is November 10th, and the second is also on 
8 November 10th. 31 
9 So it looks like you were posting from Florida with someone named Angry Viking. 
10 Can you all see that? 
11 
12 A 
Q Yeah. 
Okay. And somebody named Deep Talker replies to your post, saying: 
13 "Let me know when you need some real pipe hitting boys." And you reply: "Deep 
14 Talker, Hell yeah, it's about time to act, buddy." 
15 What were you referring to there? 
16 A Honestly, I don't know. It was probably just making fun of him or 
17 something. It's --I mean, there wasn't nothing, you know --on my side, there was 
18 nothing meant to be bad about it. I was probably making fun of him or just getting him 
19 to leave me alone-type post. 
20 Q Well, you're talking --your post is about --well, Mr. Wire says: "D.C. this 
21 weekend, you in?" You say, "Dan Wire, you driving?" So it seems Deep Talker might 
22 be referring to the weekend in Washington, D.C. 
23 Did you at all expect there to be violence that weekend? 
24 
25 A 
Q No. 
So do you remember what you did in November in D.C.?  32 
1 A I mean, the only thing I can think of would be in the crowds, you know, just 
2 seeing everything. I can't remember if they had a stage or something, a stage set up or 
3 something or --I don't know. I really don't know. Just in the crowd with everybody 
4 just walking around. 
5 
6 
7 Q 
A 
Q But you weren't there to provide security or anything, right? 
No, I don't think so. 
Did you talk to any other members of Three Percenter groups while you 
8 were in D.C.? 
9 A I don't --honestly, I don't know who we talked to or who was there. It was 
10 just chaos, I guess, around with all the people, and I can't remember that kind of stuff. 
11 Q That's okay. I want to show you exhibit 18, which is a screenshot that you 
12 provided to us. It looks like someone took a picture of you and then posted. 
13 
14 
15 
16 A Antifa did. 
Q So it's antifa. That's them? 
A Yeah. 
Q "Chucklefuck on the right in picture 1 had the pliers and flashed the sign 
17 after Federal police told them to F off." 
18 Do you know what this person is talking about? 
19 A I have no idea. I guess he's --what --me, I guess, is that what he's calling 
20 Chucklefuck? 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 Mr. Wiest. Do you know? 
The Witness. No, I don't know. I don't know who he's talking about. 
Q 
A BY-
Did you bring pliers to D.C.? 
Did I bring what?  33 
1 Q The person's post mentions pliers. It's not clear if he's talking about you or 
2 another person in the photo. So did you bring pliers to Washington, D.C.? 
3 A No. No, I didn't have anything on me at all. Just a jacket and a shirt right 
4 there, my glasses. 
5 Q Okay. Did that that person, Angry Viking, who you mentioned in the 
6 previous post, go to Washington, D.C., on November 14th? 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 A No. You're talking about in D.C.? 
Q Yeah, in D.C. 
A No. To my knowledge, he wasn't there that I know of. 
Q Okay. And who is Angry Viking? 
A Just a nobody guy, maybe. I mean, he's not --I mean, he's nothing, really. 
12 He just got a bunch of people together, that was it, for a march down in Louisville, and 
13 one in Florida. And after that, he's just --I don't know what he does. 
14 Q Understood. So now we're going to talk about that December 12, 2020, 
15 rally that you remembered earlier. Do you remember how you learned about that 
16 event in Washington, D.C.? 
17 A Social media, I do believe.  1

8 
9 Q Okay. But you can't remember a specific poster, things like that? 
A 
Q No. 
I'm going to show you exhibit 2, page 2. 
Am I sharing it? Nope. Sorry about that. 
So you'll see --can you see this, Mr. Kuntz? 
A Yes. 34 
10 Q Great. And so this is a Facebook post from you sharing what looks to be a 
11 flyer for the march for Trump on December 12, 2020. And you say, "This is Reaper. 
12 We are going." 
13 Who is the "we"? 
14 
15 
16 A 
Q 
A Probably me and Dan. 
Did you go with anyone else from Grey Ghost? 
No. I think it was just --it was just me and him that drove together, if that's 
17 what you're asking. 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 Q Yeah. Did you meet --
A Just me and --
Q Go ahead. 
A Yeah, it was just me and him. 
Q Did you meet up with anybody in D.C. that day? 
A I don't think so. I don't --I don't really know. Let's put it that way. 
24 really don't know. There was so many people there. 
25 Q Okay. Do you remember why you decided to go to D.C. for this march?  35 
A Just to go. That's the best way to describe it. Just to go to see it. 
Q What was the purpose of seeing it? 1 
2 
3 A Well, hopefully the --I guess, see Trump and all the people and --I never --I 
4 mean, these are the only two times at that point that I had ever been to D.C., and I was 
5 more amazed with it than I was with anything else. 
6 Q So this flyer, it says, "#StopTheSteal," "#AuditTheVote," 
7 "#ElectionlntegrityNOW." 
8 
9 
10 D.C.? 
11 
12 so. 
13 A Uh-huh. 
Q Were those issues on your mind when you decided to go to Washington, 
A I don't think so. I mean, I don't --I can't be 100 percent, but I don't think 
Q So, in this post, a Jason Cum le replies to you, and I can summarize 
14 that --maybe it's a flippant comment, but saying something like "Trump did not do 
15 everything he said he would do." And you reply, "I understand but we half to stand 
16 together to fight this bull shit that is going on buddy." 
17 So what were you fighting against? 
18 A To be honest with you, I don't know. I don't know. I don't even 
19 remember writing that. 
20 Q You don't remember wanting to stand up against the, you know, 2020 
21 election results and try to get President Trump another term in office? 
A No. No, I don't. 22 
23 Q Was supporting Mr. Trump's efforts to get a second term on your mind at 
24 the time? 
25 A Honestly, I don't know what I was thinking, other than --I mean, I  1 remember, you know, D.C., being just amazed with it, because I'd never been there. 
2 You know, I'd been there in November, but then we was going back again, and I wanted 
3 to see more of it. I think that was more on my mind than anything. 
4 
5 Q Okay. 
Well, I'm going to show you page 9 of exhibit 2. This is your post from 
6 November 24th. And you say, "This is Reaper. You all need to join my telegram page 
7 with other patriots i understand how some feel but if my fb goes down we must stay in 
8 contact at any cost." 
9 Do you remember writing this post? 
10 
11 
12 A 
Q 
A No. I don't remember writing it. 
Did you start a Telegram page? 
I don't personally have a Telegram page. I don't --yeah, I don't think so. 
13 don't have one. 
14 Q Well, if we scroll down, it looks like people are sending you messages. 
15 "Message sent." Ms. Hanan says, "Absolutely." 36 
16 A What them are --I couldn't tell you what --what that was about that. But I 
17 don't think personally I ever had a Telegram page, unless it was a site, maybe an old site 
18 or something I had been on for --people could join or something. I really don't know. 
19 Q Okay. 
20 Well, a couple of days before that, on November 22nd, you posted, "This is Reaper 
21 i need all to message me soi can get you to telegram site so you can talk about patriot 
22 stuff with other patriots pis and thank you." 
23 What did you --
24 
25 A 
Q I mean, that could be. 
What did you mean by "patriot stuff with other patriots"?  1 A Patriot-type people, I guess that's --I don't know. People who wanted to 
2 talk on social media with other people about what --I guess the events that have 
3 happened or whatever. 
4 
5 
6 
7 Q 
A 
Q 
A Well, what do you take the term "patriot" to mean? 
American people. 
Is there a specific kind of American person that would be a patriot? 
No. American people in this country. American people are patriots. 
8 Everybody's a patriot, in my eyes. Me, you, everybody. 
9 
10

12

14 --
- Thankyou. 
BY-: 
Q Mr. Kuntz, I just had a couple followups on those points. 
Do you think there are Americans who aren't patriots? 
A I don't know personally. I mean, I don't know any personally, but I guess. 37 
15 I mean, that's their right, I guess. But I don't look at anybody other than a patriot in this 
16 country. 
17 Q showed you some messages that involved antifa earlier. Do you 
18 believe that individuals involved with antifa are patriots? 
19 A Yes. Everybody in this country, to me, is a patriot. They have a 
20 right --they have the same rights as I do, you do, or anybody. 
21 Q So, when you were going to protect buildings over the summer, over the 
22 summer of 2020, were you protecting them against individuals who you believed to be 
23 patriots? 
24 A Individuals --anybody that was there to destroy that property. Not --my 
25 belief is all Americans are true patriots in this country. It doesn't matter what, I guess,  38 
1 their beliefs or my beliefs or whatever, but they're still --they're still Americans. They're 
2 patriot Americans. 
3 Q Understood. You spoke earlier about, sometimes we need to bring 
4 weaponry to defend against other armed groups who had weapons. So I'm curious 
5 about what you think the purpose of those groups were if they were also patriots. 
6 A When you know that, like, another group has weapons, and if you --and you 
7 come in with yours, it's a big deterrent for no violence. They got weapons, we got 
8 weapons. And it --I've never seen any trouble whatsoever, you know, at either side. 
9 Q So are there groups that you view as threats to the constitutional order or to 
10 the United States in general? 
11 
12 
13 A 
Q 
A Me personally -­
Yes. 
--no. Because I don't --I just --I don't know if I look at things different 
14 than a lot of people do or whatever, but their side, my side, whoever's side, they're still 
15 American people, patriots. They have a right to do the things they're doing until they 
16 start, like, burning down buildings, I guess, or beating people up or something like that, I 
17 guess. 
18 Q I guess I'm a little confused, because you have described the Three 
19 Percenters as standing for the Constitution and wanting to protect individuals. So --
20 
21 A 
Q Protect people's rights. 
Right. Right. And so the armed groups who are trying to destroy other 
22 individuals' properties or potentially harm people, what do you think their purpose is? 
23 A I don't know what their purpose is. I know what my purpose is or what our 
24 group's are. Okay? If I'm there to protect property, I'm going to defend that property. 
25 Okay?  1 But anything other than that, than what we are asked to do, the police have to 
2 handle the other side. We are not police officers. 
3 
4 
5 Q Uh-huh. 
A We're there to protect the people's stuff, if we are asked. 
Q Right. And, just to be clear, you didn't expect any individuals who were 
6 trying to damage other folks' property --you didn't expect them to be in D.C. in the 
7 December event you're talking about now with-? 
A No, not that --not that I'm aware of. 
Q All right, thank you. That was helpful. 
Sorry for the interruption, 
- Absolutely fine. 39

11 
12 We've been going for about an hour and 20 minutes or so. Do you need a break, 
13 Mr. Kuntz? 
14 
15 The Witness. Can I go to the bathroom real quick? 
- Sure. Why don't we just take a 10-minute recess, and we'll come 
16 back at 11:30 or so. Does that work, Mr. Wiest? 
17 Mr. Wiest. Yep, that works. 
18 
19 
20 - Great. Thank you. 
And we'll go off the record. 
[Recess.]  40 
- We can go back on the record at 11:34 a.m. 
BY-1

3 
4 Q So, Mr. Kuntz, before the break, we had been chatting about some Facebook 
5 posts from November 2020 where you asked people to join a Telegram page. 
6 I'm going to bring those back up. And they're exhibit 2. Right now it would be 
7 page 9. 
8 Part of what you post is that "if my fb goes down we must stay in contact at any 
9 cost." Was it safe to say that you were afraid Facebook would take down your profile? 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 A I mean, by that post, maybe. 
Q Was it something that you were afraid of quite often in November 2020? 
A I don't know. I really don't know. 
Q Was it your common practice to invite people to a Telegram page? 
A Yeah, I mean, I invite people to them all the time. 
Q So here, specifically, you say "join my telegram page." So you --what 
16 Telegram pages were you inviting people to all the time? 
17 
18 A Oh. I --I don't know. 
Q Well, just describe a little bit of the process. If you weren't inviting people 
19 to your Telegram page, what were you inviting them to do? 
20 
21 
22 
23 A I guess to join Telegram. 
Q Just to join Telegram? Or to talk to specific people on Telegram? 
A I --I --I really don't know. I really don't. 
Q Well, if we go to page 11 on exhibit 2, you'll see as I start scrolling that there 
24 are a lot of people who seem to be responding to you. 
25 For example, Jeffrey Johnson says, "I would like in."  1 
2 
3 Ted Jagen, J-a-g-e-n, says, "Hell yea." 
Rick Adgate: "I'm in Patriot!" 
David Hughes: "I'm in hands down. But if we keep talking like this we will 
4 eventually be looked at and maybe looked for." 
5 Scott Pease says he sent you a message. 41 
6 "Jeff McIntosh. Douglass county, Oregon 111%. We are on Telegram, and use it 
7 regularly." 
8 So do you know who these people are? 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q No. 
Did they join your Telegram page? 
I --I don't know. I really don't. 
Do you remember getting messages from them about Telegram? 
No. No, I do not. 
Let's flip back to page 11. Shannon Marie responds that "I have maybe 3 or 
15 4 other's in my friends list who would probably be interested. I will work on that today." 
16 Someone named Karen Delph says, "Are you talking about AV or something else?" 
17 Shannon Marie says, "Something else, would you like me to send you the link?" And 
18 eventually you respond, "something else." 
19 What is "AV"? 
20 
21 
22 
23 A The only thing I can think of, "AV" is the Angry Viking. 
Q Was this a Telegram site for Angry Viking? 
A 
Q I don't know. I don't remember. 
It seems you said "something else," so, at that time, what would that else 
24 have been? 
25 A Yeah, I don't remember.  1 
2 
3 Q 
A 
Q Were you often inviting people to Angry Viking's Telegram site? 
I --I --I don't remember. I really don't. 
So, for instance, do you know who Jeff McIntosh is, the person who said 
4 "Douglass county, Oregon 111%"? 
5 
6 
7 
8 A 
Q 
A 
Q No, I do not. 
Do you know who Dan Markle is? "I sent a pm but I'm interested." 
No, I do not. 
Do you have any idea why all these people are interested in joining this 
9 Telegram site based on your post? 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q No, I do not. 
Do you remember what you talked about on Telegram around this time? 
No, sir, I do not. 
Was there ever a discussion about civil war? 
I --I --I really don't know. 
Okay. 
16 Well, if we go to page 19 of this exhibit, this is a post you made on 
17 November 18th: "I really hope everyone on here has made peace with god and who 
18 ever and is ready to take back our country because the shit is coming people." 42 
19 And it looks like you post a link to your Parler account. Do you recognize that as 
20 a Parler account belonging to you? 
21 
22 
23 
24 A 
Q 
A 
Q No, I do not. 
Do you remember using Parler? 
No, I do not. 
In the course of providing documents for this deposition, from what you 
25 responded to me earlier, did you check if you had a Parler account?  1 
2 A No. I don't --I don't remember ever having one. 
Q Okay. 43 
3 And thinking about the December 12, 2020, rally in Washington, D.C., did you talk 
4 to other groups, like the Proud Boys, before you went? 
5 
6 
7 A No, sir. 
Q Okay. 
I want to show you a post that you made on November 24th. It's page 10 of 
8 exhibit 2. 
9 "This is Reaper. Washington plaza in Washington DC December 12 is the 
10 meeting place of patriots and proud boy's are meeting up to counter blm and antifa. It's 
11 time to show them who owns the street's we are done sitting back." 
12 Were you talking to Proud Boys about going to the December 12th rally? 
13 
14 A 
Q No, sir. 
How did you know the Proud Boys would be in Washington, D.C., on 
15 December 12th? 
16 
17 A I don't remember. 
Q And, back to-questions about patriots, this sentence structure is 
18 set up so that you're --the "patriots and proud boy's are meeting up to counter blm and 
19 antifa." So why would that be necessary if BLM and antifa are patriots? 
20 A I don't know. 
21 Q What did you expect BLM and antifa to be doing in Washington, D.C., on 
22 December 12th? 
23 
24 
25 A I don't --I don't know what they'd be doing. Hopefully just nothing. --? 
- Thankyou.  1 
2 Q BY-: 
You said earlier you didn't expect there to be any sort of hostile group 
3 activity in D.C. in November or December. Do you remember now any mention of 
4 potentially dangerous groups being there, given this post? 
5 
6 A 
Q No, I do not. 
So what do you mean when you say "done sitting back"? What kind of 
7 activity does that imply to you, reading the post? 44 
8 A I --honestly, I don't remember. I don't remember, you know, saying that or 
9 anything. I don't know what that could've meant at that time. I don't know. 
10 
11 
12 Q 
Q Thanks. 
BY-: 
Reading it today, though, I think-was trying to get at, what is --how 
13 do you take this post today? 
14 
15 
16 A 
Q 
A Just a rant. Maybe people just --people just to show up for a rally. 
Why did you feel the need to rant? 
I mean, I don't know why I ranted that day about that. I mean --I don't 
17 know. It makes you feel better to get whatever off your chest at that time, I guess. 
18 Q So we've seen a number of posts, though, where you're mentioning similar 
19 language about patriots, and I'm trying to --we'll scroll down a little bit here. 
20 Earlier on November 24th, you said, "This is Reaper i hope all on here are ready to 
21 go to work if Biden gets in because we all will half to do the right thing in order to save 
22 this country.once again we shall rise to defend her." 
23 So there seems to be a common theme of, you know, protecting the country 
24 against some sort of enemy; it seems like President Biden here. 
25 So do you remember what you were ranting against at that time in general?  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 A No, sir, I do not. 
Q Well, why would people need to rise up to save the country? 
A I --I really don't know. 
BY-: 
Q This post-just showed you was on November 24th, and you say 
6 there, "if Biden gets in." So, obviously, by that point, the election had been called for 
7 President Biden a few weeks beforehand. 
8 Did you believe at the time of this comment that there might be a chance that 
9 President Biden would not take office? 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 A I really --I don't --I don't know. I mean, I really don't. 
Q And --
A It's --
Q Go ahead. 
A It's been so long back, I don't know. 
Q And returning to -'s question, do you have any sense of what you 
16 meant by rising to defend our country against, what it seems to be, the threat of the 
17 President-elect? How else do you read that comment? 
A No, sir, I do not. 
Q Okay. 
BY-: 45 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 Q I'm going to scroll to page 16 and 17, just to try again just for your memory. 
So, on November 20th, it looks like you posted what I'll call a meme. It says, 
23 "This is Reaper. Lets see who agrees with this. Are you ready to give up everything to 
24 do the right thing when the time comes?" That post was at 6:17 p.m. 
25 And earlier in the day, at 8:10 a.m., you posted, "I abide by the law's of the  46 
1 constitution not by the law's of a tyrant governor." Someone named Scott Stoebe, 
2 S-t-o-e-b-e, says, "By the constitution we should of already been hanging motherfuckers," 
3 and you reply, "agreed brother." 
4 
5 How do you take that post? 
A I --I --I don't know. I mean, at that time --I mean, I don't know what I was 
6 thinking at that time. 
7 Q Is there any other way to read you responding to Mr. Stoebe in this way 
8 other than that you agreed with his point, that people should've been hanging? 
9 A I don't know --now, we're not like that. We don't go and just hang people. 
10 I mean, that could --that could mean anything. I mean, I really --I honestly, I don't 
11 know. 
12 
13 
14 Q So I guess the first question is, do you know Mr. Stoebe? 
A No, I do not. 
Q But he has commented on your Facebook posts before? Or --do you 
15 recognize his name? 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 A No, sir, I do not. 
Q Okay. So what other meanings could "hanging motherfuckers" have? 
A 
Q 
A That --that's him. That's his, I guess, his belief, his way of talking. 
But you do say, "agreed brother." So what are you agreeing to? 
I mean, I don't agree to that. So I don't know what I was thinking at that 
21 time. I don't know. 
22 
23 
24 
25 Q At the time, were you worried about the direction of the country? 
A Nnn---
Q It's just a --
A No.  47 
1 Q Well, just help us out a little bit, Mr. Kuntz, because it's a pretty extreme 
2 statement. And there's a series of similar posts that evoke --that seem to evoke a sense 
3 of, like you said, ranting or outrage. So we're just trying to understand what it was that 
4 was making you angry or upset or concerned at the time. 
5 A I --I --I really honestly do not know at that time. I don't know what I was 
6 thinking or even doing that day. 
7 Q Well, not just that day; in general around this time. Following the 2020 
8 election and, you know, up through these rallies so far, that's the time period we're 
9 talking about. Do you think it had anything to do with the 2020 election? 
10 
11

20 about? A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Do I think? 
Do you think, yes. 
I don't know. I don't think so. 
Do you have reason to believe it was something else that you were angry 
I --I don't know. 
Okay. --
- Sure. 
BY-: 
Q So I'm wondering if you can give us any more clarity on who you think Mr. 
21 Stoebe might have meant when he was talking about, quote/unquote, "motherfuckers" 
22 who should be hanged. Do you have any recollection of who that is? 
23 
24 A 
Q I --I have no idea. 
Is this the kind of content that you regularly saw on your Facebook? 
25 Because, for me, this would stand out in my memory.  48 
1 A People --people post whatever. I don't --I mean, I can't stop them from 
2 posting stuff, you know, on what they post on mine or anything. I mean, I --I don't 
3 know what this was about or anything. I really don't know. 
4 
5 Q And so I believe -- ( if you could scroll up just to see the initial post. 
So this is what the post was about, that it was the laws of the Constitution and not 
6 a tyrant Governor. Who was the tyrant Governor you're talking about there? 
7 
8 A 
Q I --I would say Andy Beshear. 
Right. Governor of Kentucky at the time. Why would you have 
9 characterized him as a tyrant in this post in November 2020? 
10 A I --like I said, I really don't know. I don't know what was going on at that 
11 time. 
12 Q Well, I think one thing that was going on was that the election had happened 
13 a couple of weeks prior, and President Trump was heavily contesting, as I'm sure you 
14 remember, his loss. 
15 So do you think that there was anything that the Governor was doing related to 
16 those efforts that would've struck your anger? 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 A I really --I really don't know why I posted that. 
BY-: 
Q Were you upset about the COVID lockdowns at the time? 
A Well, yeah. I'm sure everybody was. 
Q Would that have been a possible reason for this post? 
A I don't know. I really do not know. 
BY 
Q So is it fair to say that the tyrant Governor might be one of the people that 
25 Mr. Stoebe is referring to in his comment below? That's directly what you were saying,  1 so --
2 A I honestly do not know why I posted this or what it was about, if I was 
3 mad or not mad or anything. I really do not know. 
4 
5 Q Uh-huh. 
A That's the best answer that I can give you, is I don't know. 49 
6 - Well, thinking of that --unless you have anything further on that,. 
7 ~ 
8 - Not on this post, no. 
9 BY-: 
10 Q So, back to the December 12th rally, do you remember what happened that 
11 day? 
12 A December the 12th? 
13 Q The rally in Washington, D.C. What did you do that day? 
14 A Walked around with a bunch of people, a few million people, and --I mean, 
15 that's, I guess, basically about it. 
16 Q And I know you mentioned earlier that someone named Chrissie might've 
17 gone with you, along with Dan Wire. Did any other people go with you to Washington, 
18 D.C., for the December 12th rally? 
19 
20 
21 
22 A No, not with us. No. 
Q Were the Grey Ghost Patriot Rangers --did they go as a group? 
A 
Q No. No. 
Did you have any conversations with other Three Percenter groups who 
23 went to D.C. that day? 
24 
25 A Did I? 
Q Yes.  A 
Q 
A 
Q I don't remember. 
And you were not there to provide security to anybody? 
No. 
Okay. 
Well, we'll move on to leading up to the January 6th rally. 
- - if you don't mind, before you go on to that --
- Oh, sure. Yeah, please.

9 Q I was hoping you could help us understand, Mr. Kuntz, some of your broader 
10 motivation in this time period. Because I know sometimes it's hard to pin down what 
11 you were thinking when there's a particular social media post we're putting in front of 
12 you. Understood that. 
13 My question then would be, what were some other issues that were animating 
14 you at the time period we're discussing, late 2020? You mentioned the COVID 
15 lockdowns as a source of anger for you just a couple minutes ago. Was that animating 
16 your activities throughout the year? 
17 A No, I don't think I said that I was angry. I mean, I just said everybody was 
18 angry at that time. So --
19 
20 Q 
A So were you angry about the COVID lockdowns? 
Well, as far as I know, everybody, you know, was mad about that, you know, 
21 being locked down and not being able to do your normal things. I would say people 
22 were upset. 
23 Q And were you ever involved in any armed protests or protest activity related 
24 to the COVID lockdowns? 
25 A Are you asking if we come out armed against something because of  51 
1 lockdowns? 
2 Q No, just if there was --you mentioned sometimes you have to bring arms to 
3 a protest if you think there are going to be other groups that are armed. And you said 
4 sometimes you don't go with any gear. So were there ever any activities related to the 
5 COVID-19 restrictions where you and your organization would appear at an event? 
6 
7 
8 
9 A 
Q 
A 
Q No, I don't --I don't think so. 
Okay. How about --oh, go ahead. 
Oh, that's okay. Go ahead. 
All right. This is helpful for us just to better understand what was 
10 motivating you throughout this time period. 
11 And 2020 was obviously a really tumultuous year for everyone, and another issue 
12 that came up quite a lot in the middle of the year was the Black Lives Matter protests and 
13 associated events. So what did you think about those events when they started 
14 happening in the middle of the year? 
15 A As long as they were peaceful, I mean, I didn't have any problem --I mean, 
16 I've talked to a lot of BLM people. You know, good people. They're really good people. 
17 There are bad apples in, I guess, every bunch, you could say. 
18 Q 
19 accomplish? 
20 
21 
22 
23 A 
Q 
A 
Q So the bad folks in that bunch, what do you think they were trying to 
I have no idea. I wouldn't even suggest even saying anything on that -­
Okay. 
--because I don't --
In some of the posts that we've looked at, I think just the last post we looked 
24 at, or two posts ago, there was a reference to BLM and antifa in D.C. 
25 Did you see antifa involved in the BLM protests earlier in the summer in Kentucky?  1 
2 
3 A 
Q 
A Did I see them? 
Uh-huh. Did you think they were --did you think they were involved? 
Oh. No, I think it was more --well, I really don't know who was there or 52 
4 who was involved in it, which parties were what. Because there was so much going on 
5 at that time. 
Q 
A More broadly, what do you think of when you think of antifa? 
I'm trying to answer this. 6 
7 
8 I don't know what to think of them. You see so much on social media. So what 
9 do you believe? Other than --I don't know. I don't know. I don't even want to 
10 answer that, because I don't know how to answer it. 
11 Q I guess I'll put a finer point on it. Do you think that antifa represents a 
12 threat to the Constitution, to the safety of individuals? 
13 A Again, I really don't know how to even answer that because of the --there's 
14 so much social media on it that I --I really don't know. 
15 Q Do you think that people in antifa act patriotically when they are involved in 
16 protests or riots? 
17 A I guess there's a general --I mean, from what I see, like I said, there's good, 
18 there's bad. 
19 Q So, when you wrote that you needed to show antifa that you owned the 
20 streets in D.C. in December, was that a reference to the bad parts of antifa? 
21 A I --I can't answer that, because I don't know why I --that that was posted at 
22 that time or anything. 
23 
24 
25 Q 
A Uh-huh. 
I can't. So I --I don't know. 
- - back to you.  1

4 Thank you, Mr. Kuntz. 
The Witness. Thank you. 
BY-: 
Q Mr. Kuntz, were you aware at the time --so now we're going to move past 53 
5 the December 12th rally into late December 2020 and early January. Were you aware of 
6 a rally being held in Washington, D.C., on January 6, 2021? 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Yes. 
Do you remember when you learned about it? 
The social-media-type stuff again, I guess --
Do you remember --
--that point. 
Do you remember a tweet by former President Trump mentioning a wild 
13 protest in Washington, D.C.? 
14 
15 
16 A 
Q A wild protest? 
Yeah. I'll share on my screen with you. One second. This is exhibit 4. 
So this is a tweet from December 19th in the early morning where Donald Trump 
17 mentions a report by Peter Navarro, and he says, "Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be 
18 there, will be wild!" 
19 Do you remember this post? 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q No, I do not. 
Do you remember hearing about this post? 
No, I do not. 
Did you want --did you end up going to Washington, D.C., on January 6th? 
Yes. 
Do you remember when you decided to go to Washington, D.C., on  54 
1 January 6th? 
A No, I do not. 2 
3 Q So this is exhibit 6. I'm not entirely sure what date it was posted. But you 
4 say, "This is Reaper. Washington D.C. is listing to us we have there attention for the 6th 
5 and the 20th that the militia groups are coming." 
6 And it looks like you responded to somebody. And, again, we have an 
7 incomplete post here. Said, "Va he asked for patriots on the 6th i haven't seen him ask 
8 for the 20th yet but we are going then." 
9 Who asked for patriots on the 6th? 
10 A I don't know exactly who posted stuff, but, I mean --I don't --I don't know. 
11 I don't even remember --remember that day. 
12 
13 
14 Q Okay. 
We'll show you exhibit 7. 
And, I'll be there in a sec. 
15 So the first page here, as you might have become aware, someone submitted, it 
16 looks like, an email to the FBI on December 21st, attaching a post that you made. 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 And this is the post. I can zoom in a little bit for you. 
A I'd appreciate it. 
Q Can you see that? 
A Uh --
Q A little more? 
A Well, no, it needs to go up. Not too much. 
Q So this post is from you. It says "yesterday" when it was captured, so I'll 
24 represent to you that yesterday from December 21st when it was sent to the FBI would 
25 be December 20th.  55 
1 So, somewhere around December 20th, you post, "This is Reaper. I need a group 
2 from ohio that is going on tbe 20th to message me pis thank you." 
3 And in response, a Chuck Waller says, "Are y'all going to answer the Presidents call 
4 on the 6th?" And you say, "Yep." 
5 Was it your view that President Trump had called you to Washington, D.C., on 
6 January 6th? 
7 
8 
9 
10 A 
Q 
A No, not a call. I mean --no, I don't --I don't --I don't think so. 
How would you take that, your response, then? 
How do I take that response? 
Q Yeah. You wrote "yep" in response to Chuck Waller's specific question 
11 asking if you are going to answer the President's call on the 6th. 
12 
13 A 
Q I --honestly, I don't know what I was thinking that day. I don't know. 
Do you remember going to Washington, D.C., to see President Trump on 
14 January 6th? 
15 
16 
17 
18 A Yes. 
Q And that is why you went to D.C., to support President Trump, correct? 
A Yes. 
Q So do you think President Trump called people to Washington, D.C., on 
19 January 6th? 
20 
21 A I --I don't know. 
Q Well, we just showed you the tweet where he said, be there, be wild. And 
22 now someone named --do you know who Chuck Waller is? 
23 
24 
25 A No, I do not. 
Q And do you know why you were asking for a group from Ohio? 
A No, I do not.  Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Were you planning anything for January 20th? 
No, sir. 
Were you planning on going to Washington, D.C., on January 20th? 
If it was just, like, a --just another protest rally, maybe. I don't know. 
Okay. --
- Thanks,

9 Q So I'm wondering --you said you hadn't been to D.C. before November 20th. 
10 Is that correct? 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q From November? 
You hadn't been to D.C. before this time period, correct? 
I was there in November and December. 
Right, but before November, you had never visited beforehand. 
Oh. No, I'd never --never seen it, never been there, nothing. 
So why was it important for you to go potentially four times, if you were 
17 going to go to a protest on the 20th, four times in 4 months --four times in 3 months, 
18 actually? What was so important that brought you there after so many years where you 
19 hadn't been once? 
20 
21 
22 A 
Q 
A Because I had a chance to go and see it. 
What was the chance? 
Going and, you know --and then to be --it was a rally, and he was going and 
23 asked if I wanted to go. That's the only thing I can think, because I've never seen it. 
24 Q And why --it seems like from these messages that you were actually trying 
25 to organize more individuals to go. So I guess I'll ask again: What was so important  57 
1 about that 3-month period, November 2020 to January 2021, that you wanted to go back 
2 so many times? 
3 
4 A I don't know. 
Q Well, you said to -that you did think that President Trump wanted 
5 your support and you went to go see the President, right? 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 A Are you talking about in January? 
Q Yes. 
A I don't know what I was thinking at that time. Maybe. 
Q Well, I think you said earlier that you were going to see the President. 
A Well, for the rally on J6, yes, just to hear him --his speech. 
Q Why --were you there to support him? 
A To support him? 
Q Uh-huh. 
A Yes. 
Q Why do you think he needed your support on January 6th? 
A I --I don't know. 
Q Did it have anything to do with his claims that the election was being stolen? 
A Did --can you say that again? 
Q Did President Trump's need for support on January 6th have any relationship 
20 to his claims that the election was being stolen from him? 
21 
22 
23 A 
Q 
A I don't know. 
Did you believe that was the case? 
I don't know --I don't know how to answer it, because I don't know what I 
24 was thinking back then, because I don't know. 
25 Q Uh-huh.  58 
I don't --you know, I just don't know. 1 
2 A 
Q At the time, were you aware that January 6th was the day that the Congress 
3 was certifying the results of the election? 
4 
5 A 
Q Then, again, I --I don't know. 
That was a pretty prominent story in the news at the time. As a casual 
6 observer of the news, did you have any awareness of January 6th's importance in the 
7 election certification process? 
8 A Like I said, I don't know what I was thinking there. Personally, I'm not a 
9 political person, I mean, on that type stuff. I don't keep --
10 
11 Q Mr. Kuntz, we're asking all these questions because it's --and I want to move 
12 on to exhibit 8. We're asking you all these questions because you have made repeated 
13 posts in the span of 3 months that indicate that you are paying attention, going to rallies, 
14 supporting President Trump. And it is a little difficult to believe, quite frankly, that you 
15 don't remember why you posted anything during the time. 
16 So this is a post by someone named C. James --I might mispronounce the last 
17 name --Du, D-u, Buisson, B-u-i-s-s-o-n. 
18 Do you know who this person is? 
19 
20 A 
Q I don't think so. I don't think so. 
So this person says, "What do you guys think is going to happen Jan. 6th?" 
21 His post is December 21st. 
22 And if we go down to page 4 --sorry about that --you reply, "Hell you better be 
23 ready for it." And someone named Anthony Howard replies, "been ready since 
24 9/11/2001 brother." 
25 So what do you need to be ready for on January 6th?  59 
1 A I don't know. To go? I don't know. I don't know what I was thinking at 
2 that time. 
3 Q Were you talking to people in the Grey Ghost Patriot Ranger about 
4 January 6th? 
5 
6 
7 
8 A About going. I mean, other than the guy I rode with --me and him talked. 
Q What did you guys talk about the day? 
A I don't --I don't know what we talked about. 
Q Well, this post is 2 days after President Trump says, "Be there, will be wild!" 
9 And you say, "Hell you better be ready for it" on January 6th. 
10 What is there to be ready for? 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 A I don't know. 
Q Do you know who Anthony Howard is? 
A That name does not ring a bell. 
Q Okay. 
We'll go to exhibit 9. On Christmas Eve, December 24th, you post, or 
16 repost --I'm not sure if this is your own words or somebody else's that you have 
17 reposted --can you see this, Mr. Kuntz? 
18 
19 
20 
21 A I mean, I see it there. 
Q Do you want me to zoom in a little bit? 
A No, it looks --that's okay. 
Q So it looks like a letter to Members of Congress. 
22 "Most of you should be in prison for counterfeiting, fraud, conspiracy, grand theft, 
23 extortion, criminal invasion of privacy, racketeering, international drug trading, insider 
24 trading, and more. 
25 "Your decades of crime transformed our republic from the post revered to the  60 
1 most feared on earth." 
2 And we can skip to the last paragraph. 
3 "You're too late. We The People now have a detailed, long-term plan of action 
4 that includes taking you out of D.C. forever. Criminals masquerading as public servants, 
5 YOU ARE GOING DOWN. 
6 "Signed, We The People." 
7 Why did you repost this? 
8 
9 
10 
11 A I --I don't know. 
Q What's the "detailed, long-term plan of action"? 
A "Detailed, long-term" --I have no idea. I don't ever remember this post. 
Q And I don't mean to be insulting about this question, but is there a medical 
12 reason or other reason that you don't remember what you were thinking during this time 
13 period? 
14 
15 A No. 
Q There's no dependency on drugs or alcohol that would have impeded your 
16 memory--
17 
18 
19 
20 A I don't do --
Q --during this time? 
A --drugs, and I'll drink a beer or two occasionally. Other than that, that's it. 
Q Okay. So you agree, then, that you had your faculties about you when you 
21 were making these posts? 
22 
23 A Well, yeah, I guess so. 
Q Vet you don't remember what you were thinking, feeling, just anything in 
24 general about what was going on that would've led you to put these posts on Facebook 
25 repeatedly.  1 
2 
3 A 
Q 
A 61 
No, I do not. 
Do you know what martial law is, Mr. Kuntz? 
Vaguely. I'm not --not, like, to the T. I guess something --lockdowns or 
4 something, I don't know, to that effect. 
5 Q If I represented to you that martial law is when the government uses the 
6 military to take over the normal course of society and enforce strict laws in times of, you 
7 know, unrest or war, does that sound like a decent enough definition of martial law? 
8 
9 A Yes. 
Q So, if we go back to exhibit 2 --oops, sorry --page 6. I'm not entirely sure 
10 when you posted this, so I'll represent that to you. 
11 You say, "This is Reaper. What is your answer is it war or marshall law it must be 
12 one or the other a group has sent demands to the white" --I think a typo, White 
13 House --"its your choice." 
14 Why the dichotomy between martial law and war? 
15 
16 A 
Q I don't know why I posted that. 
If we scroll down one more page, it looks like you repost something from 
17 Dan Markle, who earlier you said you don't know. "TAKE YOUR PICK .... WILL.IT BE WAR 
18 OR WILL IT BE MARSHALL LAW IN ORDER TO REFORM BIG BROTHER? THIS IS NOT A 
19 DRILL!!!! WE THE PEOPLE HAVE CONTACTED THE WHITE HOUSE." 
20 And you note that the "Gray gost ky Rangers 3% group thats from the we the 
21 people." 
22 Do you know what you're talking about here? 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A I have no idea. 
Is Dan Markle a member of the Grey Ghost Kentucky Patriot Rangers? 
No.  1 Q Did the Grey Ghost Kentucky Patriot Rangers ever submit a petition to the 
2 White House? 
3 
4 A 
Q Not that I'm aware of. 
Do you remember signing a petition to the White House calling for the 
5 invocation of the Insurrection Act? 
6 
7 
8 
9 A Who, me? 
Q Yes, you. 
A Not that I'm aware of. 
Q So, when you say "thats from the we the people," are you not referencing 
10 what some people have contacted the White House about? 
11 
12 A That's --I --I really don't know or remember anything about that. 
Q In exhibit 6, which we saw a little earlier, you talk about militia groups 
13 coming to D.C., you wrote, for the 20th, the 6th, or both. 
14 Which militia groups were you talking about? 
15 A I --I do not know. 62  1 
2 [12:21 p.m.] 
3 BY-: 
How did you know militia groups would be there? 
I don't know. 63 
4 
5 
6 Q 
A 
Q Did you see social media posts about militias coming to Washington, D.C., on 
7 those days? 
8 
9 A 
Q I do not know. I really don't. 
Exhibit 11 is another post on Facebook: "This is Reaper to all. We will be 
10 meeting at the Lincoln Memorial 9:30 to start the march to the event at 10:30. This is to 
11 all groups so we can march in there as one big unit." 
12 And if we scroll down, someone questions: "At the Lincoln Memorial?" You 
13 seem to say: "Damn phone LOL." 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 Was that a typo, the Lincoln Memorial? 
A 
Q 
A I don't know. I really don't. 
Do you believe that this post is about January 6th, being in D.C.? 
I don't know. 
Q So you then say: "I cannot say which groups will be there." How did 
19 you --why did you say that? 
20 
21 
22 
23 A What, "damn phone"? 
Q No, "I cannot say which groups will be there." 
A Oh. I don't know. 
Q So did you have insider information about groups meeting up that you 
24 couldn't share with other people? 
25 A I don't know. I really don't know.  64 
Q Were you in contact with other militia groups in January of 2021? 
A Of 2021? 1 
2 
3 Q Were you in contact with any other militia groups in January 2021, including 
4 the Oath Keepers, including groups like the Proud Boys, other Three Percenters? 
5 
6 A 
Q I don't know. 
I'm just trying to get a sense of --your post said this is so all groups can 
7 march as one big unit and then you responding to people saying you cannot tell them 
8 which groups are going to be there. 
9 Reading that today, would you say that you acted as if you had insider information 
10 about which groups are gathering in Washington, D.C.? 
11 
12 
13 
14 A What, by reading this? 
Q Yes. 
A I don't know. 
Q Let's go to exhibit 4, another Facebook post from yourself. Scroll down to 
15 the end. You make a comment about --and, again, it's not perfectly synced so it's not 
16 entirely clear what you were replying to, but you say: "Washington Monument on the 
17 6th at 11." 
18 Did you plan to meet up with anybody at the Washington Monument at 11 o'clock 
19 on January 6th? 
20 
21 
22 6th? 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A I don't know. 
Did you end up meeting up with anybody in Washington, D.C., on January 
I don't think so. 
Did you march with a group of people in Washington, D.C., on January 6th? 
I mean, I went with the crowd, if that's what you're talking about, with the  1 crowd people. 
2 
3 
4 Q 
A 
Q Did you start at the Washington Monument at 11 o'clock? 
I do believe so. 
Do you know --do you remember who was there? Were there people 
5 dressed in military fatigues, for example? 
A Oh, God, I don't remember. 
Q Did you talk to any Oath Keepers while you were there? 65 
6 
7 
8 A I don't remember, because I don't remember that there was so many people 
9 there. I don't know who I talked to and who I didn't talk to. So I don't know. If I 
10 knew, I would answer. 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 Q How about Proud Boys? 
A What did he say? 
Q What about the Proud Boys? 
Mr. Wiest. Did you talk to any Proud Boys? 
The Witness. I don't know, because there was so many people there. I mean, I 
16 could have. 
17 BY 
18 Q To your knowledge, though, you did not --you don't remember speaking to 
19 any Proud Boys? 
20 
21 
22 
23 A No, I do not. 
Q Did you expect any sort of violence in Washington, D.C., on January 6th? 
A No. 
Q We'll scroll up to the beginning of this post, and you note --if you need me 
24 to zoom in a little bit --that it's time for people to start making hard choices. It is time 
25 to start standing up to the police. We follow the laws but a lot of officers are not. It is  1 time to start standing up against them and fighting back. 
2 Does that sound like you anticipated violence? 
3 
4 A 
Q No. 
What would you describe standing up and fighting back against law 
5 enforcement to be, Mr. Kuntz? 
6 
7 
8 
9 I don't know what I was thinking at that time. 
Was it your view that the police were on the side of acting like tyrants? 
I'm sorry, could you ask that question again? 
Were the police acting like tyrants? 
Not --not that I can remember. 66 
10 
11 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q I'll pass it to-in one second, but you see that this name Scott Stoebe 
12 replies "on board" here. And you represented that you don't know him, but I will ask 
13 again because his name has appeared again. 
14 Do you recognize the name Scott Stoebe? 
15 A No, I do not. 
16 - Okay,_ 
17 The Witness. I'm not good with names anyway, but he does not --I do not recall 
18 him. 
19 BY-: 
20 Q 
21 justified? 
22 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A 
Q Mr. Kuntz, do you believe that violence against law enforcement is ever 
Is what now? 
Do you believe that violence against law enforcement is ever justified? 
No, there should be no violence against an officer. That's why we got laws. 
What if those officers are acting like tyrants?  1 
2 A 
Q Then they need to be dealt with appropriately. 
So in this message, are you talking about how to deal with officers 
3 appropriately if they're acting like tyrants? 
4 A I --like I said, I don't know because it's been so long since I guess I wrote 
5 that. So, I mean, I don't wish any harm to anybody. I mean, does that help? That's 
6 not me. Because I used to be --
7 Q I'm really more curious about what your intentions were on January 6th. 67 
8 take that statement, but it seems to me that talking about standing up and fighting back 
9 against law enforcement is quite a lot different than what you were talking to us earlier 
10 about coordinating with law enforcement in Louisville over the summer of 2020. 
11 So why was there a change in how you viewed law enforcement? 
12 A I don't view it any different. I have the same respect for them as I do the 
13 ones in Louisville. 
14 
15 Q 
A 
16 not by us. 
17 Q Even though you were --
They have to dealt with with --by their --their higher captains and whoever, 
But in this message, you say that you have to fight back and stand up to law 
18 enforcement who are acting like tyrants. 
19 A Yeah, but that could be, you know, file complaints against them or anything. 
20 It could mean that. It's not --probably not meant to be towards --any violence towards 
21 them. I don't take it that way. If you see one doing something wrong then --then go 
22 file your complaints, your papers, and what you need to do against that officer. 
23 BY-: 
24 Q Why don't we scroll down a little bit to page 2 and I'll read a little 
25 back-and-forth you had with a Jesse Giller who --sorry, it starts here. Yeah. Jesse  68 
1 Giller says: "Oaths never expire," showing an Oath Keeper patch. "I swear that I will 
2 support and defend the Constitution of the United States." 
3 You reply: "We stand together," and a picture of the Grey Ghost Patriot 
4 Rangers --I'm sorry, Partisan Rangers patch. You ask Jesse: "Yes, sir. Are you going 
5 to D.C. on the 6th?" Jesse replies: "Yes, we are." And then you ask: "We will be 
6 there. You all going armed or no?" 
7 And Jesse replies with advice to take two vehicles, one with arms, one without to 
8 be ready. And several years ago we went to overthrow Vomit" --not sure who Vomit 
9 is --but they didn't have enough unity. 
10 So you reply --we don't know your reply. It doesn't look there. But I think 
11 -is asking about whether there might have been violence on January 6th towards 
12 police officers, and you're asking Mr. --or Jesse Giller about going to Washington, D.C., to 
13 D.C. armed. 
14 Why would you have wanted or needed to be armed in Washington, D.C.? 
15 
16 armed. 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A I don't know why I was talking to him about that. I know we wasn't going 
When you say "we," who is "we"? 
Me and Live Wire. 
Dan Wire? 
Dan. 
- - sorry to interrupt, I just wanted to scroll down. 
- No, I was going to go there too. So thank you,-. 
BY-: 
Q A lot of these posts we're discussing are about coordination, discussion 
25 between multiple organized groups who are going to attend D.C., the protests in D.C.  69 
1 So I'm confused, frankly, because if you were planning to file a complaint with an 
2 officer who was acting like a tyrant, why would that require a convoy of organized groups 
3 to go to D.C.? 
4 A I don't know. I don't know how many groups went to D.C. I don't know 
5 none of that. I don't know who was all there. I know that me and Dan Wire were 
6 there. Now, with other groups that were there, that I don't know. There was no 
7 coordinating stuff. 
8 - I think that's all I have on this post,-. 
9 - Thank you. 
10 BY-: 
11 Q A little further down, in another back-and-forth with Mr. Scott Stoebe, 
12 Stoebe says: "If we don't win this, this whole world is fucked, guys. This is really for all 
13 the marbles." You say: "Yes, it is, Scott. If we fail the whole world will fail. They 
14 are watching and waiting on us to act." 
15 What kind of action are you talking about? 
16 
17 
18 A At that time, I do not know. 
Q So this is talking about going to January 6th. Sorry, go ahead. 
This is talking about going to January 6th. We just saw your back-and-forth with 
19 a Jesse Giller about whether to go armed and Jesse's response about take one armed car 
20 and one not. 
21 And now talking to Mr. Stoebe, who's the person, remember, who said people 
22 should already be hanging, and you said agreed, that if we fail the whole world --we fail 
23 the whole world and they're watching and waiting on us. 
24 Who is waiting on you and to do what? 
25 A I don't know. I don't --like I said, I don't remember this.  70 
1 Q So is it your posture then that you don't remember posting any of this stuff 
2 about heading to January 6th specifically in Washington, D.C.? 
3 A I mean, I know I was asked to go. It wasn't, I don't know, like I guess a 
4 planned thing. They just asked someone to go to a rally in D.C., and, okay. 
5 
6 
7 Q And who --it was Dan Wire who asked you? 
A Dan, yes. 
Q But you say, Okay. And it looks like, since you've been posting about it 
8 since December 20th or so, there's a lot of discussion. 
9 So we're just having a hard time believing that you do not remember what you 
10 were expecting to do in Washington, D.C., that people were watching and waiting on you 
11 to act. 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 A Show up to a Trump rally and walk with the people. 
Q So how would that fit --
A There was no violence or anything like that intended. 
Q What did you mean by "if we fail the whole world"? 
A I don't know what that --what that means, I really don't. I don't know. 
Q What outcome were you hoping for on January 6th? What were you 
18 hoping the protest would accomplish? 
19 
20 A I don't know. 
Q You mentioned that you took part in a march with a large group of people. 
21 Why were you marching? 
22 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A 
Q Just following with the people. Just walking with the people. 
Do you remember what the people were saying? 
Huh? 
Do you remember what the people were chanting?  1

4 A 
Q 
A 
Q Trump. I mean, that's about the extent of it, is Trump things a lot. 
Do you remember hearing the phrase "stop the steal"? 
I mean, they could have. I don't know. 
But you were there to support President Trump, as you said. Was it your 
5 hope that he would stay in office after January 6th? 
6 A I'd say I don't know what I was thinking that day, I really don't. I was just 
7 caught up in the moment with everybody. 
Do you remember listening to President Trump's speech? 71 
8 
9 Q 
A Yeah. I mean, I was right there, what I could hear of it. I mean, you can't 
10 really --you couldn't really hear where I was at. I was too far back. You can hear some 
11 loudspeaker noise-type.

A 
Q 
A 
Q Do you remember him talking about Vice President Pence? 
No, I do not, because I couldn't hear him clearly. 
Do you remember anyone around you talking about Vice President Pence? 
No, I do not. 
Were you aware that the day that Vice President Pence, his responsibility 
17 under the Constitution was to certify the electoral college vote for President Biden?

A 
Q I don't know. 
Were you communicating with any groups that day on Zella? 
I don't know. 
Do you use Zella? 
Zella, it's that walkie-talkie thing, ain't it? 
Yeah. 
24 A I think we used it one time for a little bit, but I don't think anything even 
25 worked that day in D.C.  72

22 Q I'm just still kind of struggling to understand your frame of mind while you 
23 were attending this rally. 
24 You mentioned in an earlier post we talked about that you wanted to show antifa 
25 that you owned the streets. Did you view marching after President Trump's speech as a  1 demonstration that you owned the streets? 
2 A Look, I really don't know what I was thinking that day, you know, I really 
3 don't. It could have been referring to all the people walking the street. I don't --I 
4 don't know. 
5 - That's all I have on this point,-· Thanks.

Q Just a few more questions, Mr. Kuntz. 
15 Generally, are you aware of communications between different militia groups? 
16 Are there --basically, what I'm asking directly, are there Signal chats, Telegram chats, 
17 Zella channels that you know of that are broadly encompassing a lot of different militia 
18 groups across the country? 
A Yes. I'd say the Telegram is full of them. 73 
19 
20 Q Are there specific ones that you can remember on Telegram, like, that would 
21 have a certain name? 
22 A No, I do not, I mean, other than, you know, the groups that I've already told 
23 you. I mean, people really don't talk about their groups a lot, I guess, or post or --their 
24 names of them. 
25 Q Was there a group named American Patriots Three Percent?  1 
2 A 
Q What is it now? 
Do you remember if there was a Telegram group or chat titled American 
3 Patriots Three Percent? 
4 
5 A 
Q AP3? I think there's some on there. 
And you immediately went to an abbreviation of it. Is that a standard 
6 group, American Patriots Three Percent? 
7 
8 
9 
10 that. 
11 
12 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A I would say yeah. 
Is it a national organization of some type? 
I don't know if it's national or if it's just a local group or --or anything like 
And where did you hear about AP Three Percent? 
I think I seen them once, or a couple times on --I can't remember if it was 
13 Face book or Telegram where I seen them on there. 74 
14 Q Do you remember if they were talking at all about going to Washington, D.C., 
15 on January 6th? 
16 A No, sir, I do not. 
17 Q Do you remember the types of things in general that AP Three Percent 
18 would talk about? 
19 
20 
21 A 
Q 
A No, I do not. 
Was there a Telegram chat titled "American Militia, the Last Defense"? 
I don't --I don't want to say yes, but I don't want to say no either, because it 
22 sounds familiar. 
23 Q To the best of your recollection, it sounds familiar, you just --you're not sure 
24 if there was or there wasn't? 
25 A Yeah.  1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q That's okay. How about a Telegram chat titled "American Civil War 2.0"? 
American Civil War 2.0? I'm not familiar with that one. 
Okay. How about "Civil War is Imminent"? 
I'm not familiar with that one as well. 
That's fine. 
In terms of --do you have a sense of why American Militia, the Last Defense 
7 sounded familiar? Is that phrase, "The Last Defense," something that you saw often 
8 paired with the word "militia"? 
9 A I don't know. I really don't know why or why it sounds a little familiar. 
10 don't know. 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 Q That's okay. Did you ever use MeWe, the social media site M-e-W-e? 
Mr. Wiest. MeWe. 
- MeWe, sorry. 
The Witness. I don't think so. I mean, I don't think. 
BY-: 
Q And in terms specifically and the same kind of question about these 
17 communication groups, were you aware of any chats or groups that were specific to 
18 talking about January 6th? 
19 
20 A 
Q No, I don't think so. Are you talking about just in general talking, or -­
Yes. So not necessarily ones that you were a member of, but were you 
21 aware of any other chats out there that were titled things like D.C. protest January 6th, 
22 for example? 
23 A I mean, I'm not going to say no or say yes where I've seen, you know, stuff 
24 that --I mean, I think everybody was just posting about rallies. You know, that's 
25 normally what they do. People will post about stuff, rallies or whatever, ask people if 75  76 
1 they're going or not going type stuff. 
2 Q Were they saying other things about January 6th? 
3 A Not that I can recall. Not that I can remember. 
4 Q I want to share with you exhibit 17. Can you see that post --or this Meme, 
5 I should say? Does that --have you seen that before?

Do you remember seeing this post before January 6, 2021? 
I don't think so. 
Thank you. And our last question before I'll pass it over to-
12 Does the name 1776 Returns mean anything to you? 
13 A No. 
14 Q You've never seen a document with that title? 
15 
16 
17 A I mean, not that I can remember ever seeing. 
- Thank you. -· 
- Thankyou, 
18 BY 
19 Q Mr. Kuntz, I wanted to ask if you had any more information about events 
20 following January 6th first? 
21 So you mentioned this to , but just to reiterate, did you have any 
22 involvement in the planning of a militia march that was scheduled to occur on January 20, 
23 2021? 
24 
25 A 
Q No, sir. 
Were there ever any communications you had with other individuals or  1 groups about going to D.C. on January 20th? 
2 A I mean, there might have been. I mean --I mean, I can't remember back, 
3 you know, that far what I talked about, who I talked to or any of that. You know, I 
4 mean, I really don't know. 
5 Q Do you recall yourself planning to go to D.C. on January 20th, which was 
6 Inauguration Day? 
7 A Probably. I mean, if there was a big --you know, another big event, I 
8 probably would have went. 
9 
10 Q 
A Why would you want to have gone? 
Well, just a bunch of patriot people together. I've never seen an 
11 inauguration. I'd love to have seen it. 
12 
13 Q 
A But you did not go? 
No, I did not. 
14 Q So you called --you said, a bunch of patriot people together. It sounded 
15 like you might have wanted to go to see the inauguration. But on January 20th, 77 
16 President Biden got inaugurated, and people were there to protest his inauguration, and 
17 some organized militia groups, as you saw in some of your earlier posts, mentioned going 
18 there armed. 
19 So do you take those people to be patriots? 
20 
21 A 
Q To go into an inauguration armed? 
The people who went there to protest the inauguration of President Biden 
22 and who were planning to do so with arms. 
23 A Well, not with the arms part. I know people have the right, you know, to 
24 protest, to peacefully protest, you know, and to gather. But with arms, no. 
25 Q So you wouldn't call someone who protested with arms in that specific  78 
1 setting to be acting patriotically? 
2 A No, not going there, not like that, not to do harm to anybody. Because if 
3 I'd have seen any, I'd have probably got a hold of the first police officer. 
4 Q And you are aware of what happened on January 6th with people who 
5 entered the Capitol, correct? 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 day? 
12 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Yeah. Have I seen it? Yes, I've seen the --the stuff out there. 
Would you say those people acted patriotically? 
Yeah. I mean --I mean, that's my opinion. 
I am asking for your opinion. So what about their behavior was patriotic? 
Now, you're just asking my opinion of what I think of what happened that 
I'm asking your opinion. You just stated that people who went to the 
13 Capitol on January 6th were acting patriotically. So I'm asking your opinion. Why is 
14 that your opinion? 
15 A From what I seen the most part, yes, there were bad apples in there. You 
16 know, that's not being patriotic, you know, but there's --like I said, there's bad apples in 
17 every bunch. 
18 Q So I think earlier this morning, you answered a question that everybody's a 
19 patriot when was trying to figure out, you know, why you were saying --posting 
20 that you were going to counter antifa and BLM. 
21 So is it then your --what you're saying now that sometimes some people are not 
22 patriots? 
23 A Look, I look at all people as patriots, okay, Americans. Yeah, even though 
24 they do bad things, you know, some of them, they're still a patriotic American that love 
25 their country. I guess that's the best way to put it.  79 
1 We're all patriots. We love this country. So you're a patriot. To me, in my 
2 eyes, you're a patriot. You do something bad, then you pay the price for it. 
BY-: 3 
4 Q So can I ask the question another way, Mr. Kuntz: Do you believe that the 
5 individuals who entered the Capitol on January 6th were justified in doing so? 
6 
7 A Do I have to answer that? 
Mr. Wiest. I'm going to object and instruct the witness not to answer, on the 
8 basis of the Fifth Amendment. 
9 
10 
11 - Understood. 
BY-: 
Q I'll see if I can ask another way that we can avoid the Fifth Amendment 
12 implication there. 
13 Would you say that the people who came to Washington, D.C. with plans to storm 
14 the Capitol to stop the certification of the vote in a less-than-peaceful manner were 
15 acting patriotically? 
16 
17 
18 
19 A No, I do not. 
- Thankyou. -
- Thankyou,_ 
BY-: 
20 Q You mentioned earlier that you think that law enforcement should always be 
21 respected. What are your thoughts about the law enforcement who were harmed by 
22 individuals who entered the Capitol on January 6th? 
23 A That just --to me, that's a sad day. It should not have happened. And I 
24 feel, I mean, so bad for those people, you know, that had to go through that, and I wish 
25 that it just --it never happened, that their families and these officers never had to go  80 
1 through that and will never have to go through that again. 
2 Q Understood. Do you believe that the law enforcement officers serving at 
3 the Capitol that day were on the side of the people or were they acting like tyrants? 
4 Mr. Wiest. I'm going to object to that and instruct the witness not to answer, on 
5 the basis of the Fifth Amendment. 
6 BY-: 
7 Q I guess I could ask a broader question. Why do you think there was conflict 
8 between police officers and individuals in the crowd on January 6th? 
9 Mr. Wiest. I'm going to object and instruct the witness not to answer, on the 
10 basis of the Fifth Amendment. 
11 BY-: 
12 Q Let me ask it another way: Individuals who, as-noted, who 
13 organized to come to D.C. with a plan to storm the Capitol, why do you think they had 
14 conflict with law enforcement on that day? 
15 
16 A 
Q I have no idea. I don't know. 
Understood. 
17 - - I don't have any more on this point, if you want to take 
18 over. 
19 - Thank you. 
20 BY-: 
21 Q I've got a couple more questions for you. Since January 6, 2021, Mr. Kuntz, 
22 have you been contacted by law enforcement, either State or Federal, regarding any 
23 events that happened in Washington, D.C., from November 2020 to January 2021? 
24 
25 A Now, is he talking about local or --
Mr. Wiest. He's asking about anything, including the FBI.  1

The Witness. Yes, yes. 
BY-: 
Q Which law enforcement? 
A The FBI. 
Q And how many times did they contact you? 
A Three times. 
Q Did they ask you questions? 
A Yes, sir. 
Q Can you describe what those questions were? 
A Just, you know, was I there on J6. They showed me some pictures of 
11 people, asked if I had been inside or --that's, I guess, pretty much it. Basic, you know, if 
12 I knew these people or --you know, I tried to help them out the best that I knew, that I 
13 could. I answered all their questions, to the best of my knowledge. 
14 
15 
16 
17 Q Did they ask you about your ties to militia groups? 
A They asked me if I was in a group, yes. 
Q Did they ask at all about coordination with other militia groups? 
A I don't know the exact specifics of questions that he had asked me. So I 
18 don't want to answer that and be denying or not denying, because I don't remember all 
19 the questions exactly how he asked them, or even if he asked that question. 
20 
21 
22 Q It's okay if you don't remember. 
Did you provide materials, documents, or other evidence to the FBI? 
A No. I mean, they didn't ask for anything. Just asked me questions of stuff 
23 that they had. 
24 
25 Q So they didn't take your phone or your computer or anything like that? 
A No, sir.  82 
1 - Well, I don't have any further questions. I'll check with-· 
2 Do you have anything further? 
3 - Just a few more questions. 
4 BY-: 
Q Thank you for your cooperation today, Mr. Kuntz. 
A Yes, sir. 
Q What is your current opinion of President Trump? 5 
6 
7 
8 A My opinion is I'm trying to stay away from the politics side of him and Biden. 
9 I'm just --I'm trying to ease my way out --away from that stuff. I don't want to get in it. 
10 You know, whatever happens, that's between him and the Biden administration or 
11 whatever. I just --I just don't want to get in it. I just try to stay away from it. 
12 
13 
14 Q Why are you motivated to stay away from it? 
A I guess because I'm tired of hearing about it. 
Q And is it now your belief that President Biden is the duly elected President of 
15 the United States? 
16 
17 A It's --from what I know and what I have seen, yes. 
Q What do you think of former President Trump's continuing claims that the 
18 election was stolen from him? 
19 A I don't know what to think about that, about any of that stuff, I really don't, 
20 because you hear so much, and just you get burnout on it, you know. I don't know. 
21 Q And looking back on the events of late 2020, especially January 6th, do you 
22 regret going to those events? Do you regret attending the rally on January 6th? 
23 
24 
25 A No. 
Q Would you do it again? 
A I mean, from my side of it, yes, I would. I didn't see anything wrong, I  83 
1 mean. 
Q Why would you do it again? 
A Why would I do it again? 2 
3 
4 Q Uh-huh. We've talked about a lot of the chaos that happened on that day. 
5 Why would you do it again? 
6 A Because I didn't do anything wrong. I didn't see anything wrong with it. 
7 It's just a bunch of proud patriots rallying, you know. I just --I didn't see anything was 
8 wrong with it. 
9 BY-: 
10 Q Just to follow up, do you think it's patriotic to --I don't know how else to put 
11 this --to try to stop a duly elected official from taking office? 
12 
13 A 
Q Do I believe somebody should stop that? 
Do you believe that it's patriotic to stop --to try to stop a duly elected official 
14 from taking office? 
15 A Well, if there's a problem, that's why we have the court system to intervene 
16 and see if there was anything wrong. 
17 Q Are you aware that as of January 6, 2021, no courts had found anything 
18 wrong with the 2020 election? Maybe one court had found one small thing, but nothing 
19 even remotely close to the claims that President Trump was making about the election 
20 being stolen? 
21 A You know, like I said before, you hear so much from both sides. Me 
22 personally, I just --I'm just tired of hearing it. 
23 Q I understand you're tired of hearing it now, but you mentioned that we have 
24 courts to decide if there is a dispute or someone wants to dispute someone taking office. 
25 And I'm representing to you that Federal Courts, I think some State Courts, heard 60-odd  84 
1 cases brought by President Trump from November until January of --November 2020 to 
2 January 2021, and none of them corroborated Mr. Trump's claims. 
3 Were you aware of that at the time? 
4 A No. 
5 - Thank you. -
6 - Thankyou-
7 BY-: 
8 Q I guess I have a question related to what-was just asking, which is, 
9 we talked a lot about patriotism and you said that January 6th was a bunch of patriots 
10 getting together. 
11 So do you think that it is patriotic to undermine the peaceful transfer of power? 
12 A Do I think it's --well, I don't think you should interfere in that at all. Like I 
13 said, if there's a problem then that's what we have the Supreme Court and stuff to figure 
14 this stuff out. You know, it's not our job to --to get involved and intervene in that type 
15 of stuff. I mean, I'm not going to. 
16 Q So when you were telling others on social media to stand up and fight back, 
17 that had nothing to do with the transfer of power that was upcoming? 
18 A The way that I think --I mean, I'm not going to say what I was thinking that 
19 day, but the way that I feel, no. 
20 
21 Q And what if the courts fail to find a problem? What happens then? 
A Then they're going to have to go back and redo it until they figure out 
22 what's --what's going on, what is wrong. It's not for us to interfere in that. That's why 
23 we put the court systems up there. You guys, I mean, that's you all's job. You know, 
24 figure the stuff out. 
25 Q Do you believe that the 2020 election was figured out at the end of the day?  85 
1 A Like I said before, I've seen so much in the media. At this point you don't 
2 know what to believe of what's going on, you know. I'm just waiting until you all figure 
3 it out, just like millions of other Americans.

5 - Thank you. That's all I have,-. 
- Thank you, Mr. Kuntz. I don't have any further questions, and thank 
6 you for taking the time to speak with us today. 
7 So unless, Mr. Wiest, do you have anything you want to add? 
8 Mr. Wiest. Just a clarifying question on the record. You were asked a number 
9 of questions today about social media posts from over a year ago, et cetera, and your 
10 response was "I don't know." 
11 Would it be fair to say that that would be akin to, as you sit here today, you just 
12 don't remember? 
13

15 
16 The Witness. Yes. 
Mr. Wiest. And that was the only clarification I had for the record. 
- Understood. Thank you. We will adjourn the record at 1:20 p.m. 
[Whereupon, at 1:20 p.m., the deposition was concluded.]  1
