Las1 ee ! our nation once again demonstral d the strength of our d mocracy as mor,-than 
l 40 milli n Americans c l ballots to elect their leader . I want to thank each of y u and yow· 
team for your c, traordinary ffort to nsllre that all merican could . xerci e this most 
fundamental of ri hts ith onfidenc and in afety. 
ow that Lhr:: oting has concluded it is imp rati, e that th merican peopl can tru t that 
our el c1ions,; e · conducted in such a wa that the tJutcoJn. accurate I reflect the wm of the voters. 
lthough the tate ha e the primar r, sponsibiEty to conduct and upe i election under our 
C n titution and the law enacted by ngres h nite<l tales D partm nt of Ju tice has an 
obligation to en urc that federal elecf ons a onducted in such a way that the American peopl can 
have full confiden e in th ir lectoral proces and their go ernm nt. 
The DepartrnenCs g ner I polici v,rith re ard to el lion fraud investigat" on ar 
contained in the Justice Manual. ho e p licies require, among other thing consultati n with th 
Public lntcgri.ty ection' Election rimes Branch ('ECB"') in some in tance . Tl10s. policies 
aJread~ allow pr liminary inquiri s including witnes intervie • to be ·onducted without CB 
onsult.ation. In i11 tan e in ,.: hich they are co sulted, the B s general p.ractic has been to 
counsel that overt inv stigativ t ps ordinarily hould not e taken until the election in que tion 
has b en ·onctud d its resuh c rtified and all recount and el tion onre ts c ncludcd. uch a 
pas ive and d layed enfor ement approach can re ult in situation in which election mi conduct 
cannot reali ticaU be rectified. 1oreover, this E practice has n r been a hard and fast rule, 
and as -spedfi determination and judgm nts mu t be mad . While most allegati n of 
purp ed ckcti n misconduct are of uch a scale that they would not impact the out ome of an 
election and thus, in esligation c-an appropriat ly b d ferred, that is not alwa the cas . 
Furlhermore, any cone rn that o · rt action tak n b_ th Departm nt could inadvertently impact 
an election are greatly minimiz d, if th ye, i tat all. on e oting ha c ncluded e en if I ction 
certifi ation ha not yet b , n ompleted. 
rn en this and 1iven that oting in our current electio1 has no concluded, I authorize ou 
to pur ue substantial alle .,.ations o voting and vote tabulation irregulariti prior to the c rttfi.cation 
ofelections in your ·urisdictions in cert i1 case , I ha alread done in pecific in tances. u h
