2 We'll go on the record at 2:01 p.m. Good afternoon. This is a 
3 deposition of Philip Luelsdorff conducted by the House Select Committee to Investigate 
4 the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol, pursuant to House Resolution 503. 
5 Mr. Luelsdorff, can you please state your full name and spell your name for the 
6 record. 
7 The Witness. Sure. Philip Alexis Luelsdorff. Last name is L-u-e-1-s-d-o-r-f-f. 
8 First name Philip, P-h-i-1-i-p. Alexis, A-1-e-x-i-s. 
9 Thank you, Mr. Luelsdorff. 
10 The Witness. You're welcome. 
11 At this time, Mr. Luelsdorff, can you please raise your right hand 
12 to be sworn by the official reporter. 
13 The Reporter. Do you solemnly declare and affirm under the penalty of perjury 
14 that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing 
15 but the truth? 
The Witness. I do. 
The Reporter. Thank you. 16 
17 
18 Thank you, Mr. Luelsdorff. This will be a staff-led deposition 
19 today, although members of the select committee may choose to ask questions. My 
20 
21 
22 name is I'm an investigative counsel with the committee. Other 
select committee staff joining me today are 
parliamentarian; and professional staff member; 
staff associate. 
23 There are currently no members of the select committee in attendance, and I will 
24 announce any additional participants if they join. 
25 I'd like to note for the record that what has previously been marked as exhibit 1 is  4 
1 the subpoena for Mr. Philip Luelsdorff, which is dated April 1st, 2022. The House 
2 deposition rules are included in this exhibit and were provided to you upon service of the 
3 subpoena. 
4 Under the House deposition rules, you are permitted to have an attorney present. 
5 And, at this time, can counsel for the witness please state her full name. 
6 Ms. Gordon. Yes. My name is Leslie McAdoo Gordon. I am Mr. Luelsdorff's 
7 attorney. I am licensed to practice law in the District of Columbia, the State of 
8 Maryland --
9 Oh, Ms. Gordon, I think your audio cut out just at the end there. 
10 Ms. Gordon. Can you hear me now? Again, I am Leslie McAdoo Gordon. I am 
11 Mr. Luelsdorff's attorney; licensed to practice law in Maryland, D.C., and Virginia. 
12 
13 Thank you. Ms. Gordon. 
Mr. Luelsdorff, I also want to remind you, as we do with all witnesses, that it is 
14 unlawful to deliberately provide false information to Congress. Providing false 
15 information to Congress could result in criminal penalties, including both perjury and/or 
16 providing false statements. 
17 Under House deposition rules, you may only refuse to answer a question to 
18 preserve a privilege recognized by the select committee. If you refuse to answer a 
19 question based on a privilege, staff may either proceed with the deposition on other 
20 questions or seek a ruling from the chairman on the objection. If the chairman 
21 overrules your objection, you will be required to answer the question. 
22 I'll note for the record that we received a letter from your attorney on Friday 
23 regarding your objections based on the First and Fifth Amendments. That letter has 
24 been marked as exhibit 14 and will be entered into the record. Ms. Gordon, you can 
25 expect a response from the select committee shortly, and I'll be in touch with you on that.  1 
2 Ms. Gordon. Fantastic. 
Mr. Luelsdorff, my goal today is to ask questions relevant to the 
3 select committee's inquiry with the hope that you will answer. If you have an objection 
4 or a privilege assertion, I'll ask that you or your counsel state it for the record. I'll seek 
5 to clarify the basis for each objection. 
6 I understand from the letter from your attorney that you may invoke the First or 
7 Fifth Amendment or both in response to some of our questions. Be that as it may, I will 
8 say that our goal is to understand the basis for your objection and fairly evaluate it. 5 
9 Ultimately, the more detail you can provide about the basis for the objection, the easier it 
10 will be for the select committee to consider the objection. 
11 In addition, under the House deposition rules, select committee members and 
12 select committee staff may not discuss the substance of testimony you provide today, 
13 unless the committee approves release. You and your attorney will have an opportunity 
14 to review the transcript. No other recordings of this proceeding are permitted. 
15 Mr. Luelsdorff, can you please confirm that you're not making a recording of this 
16 deposition? 
17 
18 The Witness. I am not. 
Thank you. Before we dive in, I'll just describe a couple of 
19 logistics. There is an official congressional reporter who is transcribing the record of this 
20 deposition. As you saw, the reporter is also joining us by Webex. 
21 Please wait until each question is completed before you begin your response, and 
22 we will try to wait until your response is complete before we ask our next question. The 
23 reporter can't record nonverbal responses, such as shaking your head. So it's important 
24 that you answer each question with an audible, verbal response. 
25 For the benefit of the reporter and for the record, there may be times where I  6 
1 spell a name or a word that we're using or ask you to do the same. 
2 We ask that you provide complete answers based off of your best recollection. If 
3 the question is not clear, please ask for clarification. And if you don't know the answer, 
4 please simply say so. Also, please let me know if you need any breaks. 
5 Throughout the deposition, we'll be directing your attention to exhibits, which will 
6 be displayed on the screen in front of you. When we refer you to a document, you can, 
7 of course, take time to familiarize yourself with it before we discuss it. 
8 
9 
10 
11 And, on that note, can we please pull up exhibit 1. 
EXAMINATION 
Q Mr. Luelsdorff, do you recognize this as the subpoena the select committee 
12 issued to you? 
13 A I decline to answer on the grounds that the committee's deposition process 
14 violates the Rules of the United States House of Representatives and based on my rights 
15 under the First and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution. 
16 Q Mr. Luelsdorff, do you understand that you're appearing for this deposition 
17 pursuant to the subpoena? 
18 A I decline to answer to the grounds that the committee's deposition process 
19 violates the Rules of the United States House of Representatives and based on my rights 
20 under the First and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution. 
21 Q Mr. Luelsdorff, I'll be leading the deposition today, but one of the other 
22 attorneys on the call may also chime in with questions. 
23 And, we can take the exhibit down. 
24 Ms. Gordon, for the benefit of the record, would you please elaborate on the 
25 objections that Mr. Luelsdorff raised?  1 Ms. Gordon. Sure. I'll be happy to. Can you hear me before I start? Okay. 
2 Great. So my objection to those set forth in my letter, which --
3 Oh, Ms. Gordon --
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 Ms. Gordon. I cut out? 
Your audio is going in and out. 
Ms. Gordon. Can you hear my now? 
Yes. 
Ms. Gordon. I'll hold the space bar down. Okay. So the basis of the 7 
9 objections is stated in my letter of last week; April 15th --14th was the date letter. And, 
10 as we previously discussed, it is based on the fact that Mr. Luelsdorff is being deposed as 
11 a member of a civil liberties group, which has First Amendment rights, in addition to his 
12 own personal First Amendment and Fifth Amendment rights. And so the legal basis for 
13 the objections and privileges is set forth in that letter, I think, completely stated. 
14 There is also in that letter an objection based on the rules, as you have heard Mr. 
15 Luelsdorff say --don't think that the committee is complying with the Rules of the House 
16 of Representatives for purposes of conducting the deposition. 
17 Great. And the Fifth Amendment objection? I'm sorry. Did 
18 you mention that? 
19 
20 
21 Ms. Gordon. So can you hear me? 
Yes. 
Ms. Gordon. So the Fifth Amendment objection is based on results stated in the 
22 letter. It's based on the committee's view that there is potential criminal exposure for 
23 various persons as described in their recent pleading in a Federal district court case in 
24 California. It is the committee's theory of criminality, not our own, that is the basis for 
25 that objection.  1 
2 
3 Q Thank you for clarifying that, Ms. Gordon. 
BY 
Mr. Luelsdorff, for the purposes of moving along efficiently during this 
4 deposition, I am happy to offer the option of simply stating "First and Fifth" if your 
5 intention is to raise objections based on those privileges. 
A I understand. 8 
6 
7 Ms. Gordon. And what we're going to do I think is have him say "Rules, First, and 
8 Fifth," as we did with Mr. Lewis because we do have that technical rules objection. So, if 
9 
10 you're agreeable, we'll say "Rules, First, and Fifth." 
That is fine with me. I will just note that, under the House 
11 deposition rules, witnesses can only refuse to response to questions based off of 
12 privileges that are recognized by the select committee. And the rules objection that you 
13 raised is not one of the recognized privileges. And, as I stated earlier, we're going to 
14 respond to your letter. Given that Mr. Luelsdorff is also asserting the First and Fifth 
15 Amendment privileges, I don't see a problem with just looping your rules objection into 
16 that, given that he is already raising a privilege that we recognize. But I will note that for 
17 the record. 
18 
19 
20 Ms. Gordon. I understand --
The Reporter. There is no audio. 
There is an alternative option. There is a call-in number for this 
21 meeting as well. So, if you would like to use your phone to call in for audio, that would 
22 work as well. 
23 Why don't we go off the record while we resolve this at 2:12 
24 p.m.? 
25 [Discussion off the record.]  9 
Let's go back on the record. 1 
2 And, Ms. Gordon, we had just been discussing the shorthand that --the shorthand 
3 option of Mr. Luelsdorff raising objections. And are you amenable to that? 
4 Ms. Gordon. Yes. And I was making the point that I'm not saying that you are 
5 agreeing with that, just that we're agreeing on the language to be used for the assertions 
6 that we're making. 
7 Great. 
8 BY 
9 Q All right. Well, Mr. Luelsdorff, I have some questions that I would like to 
10 get through, and we'll go ahead and get that started now. 
11 But, first, Mr. Luelsdorff, I understand from your attorney that there are two 
12 separate organizations that are known as First Amendment Praetorian, with one being a 
13 nonprofit organization and one being a for-profit organization. I also understand from 
14 my conversations with your attorney that it is the nonprofit organization known as 1AP, 
15 Inc., that is the relevant entity with regard to January 6th. 
16 And, Ms. Gordon, I understand that you'll be sending us a briefing paper in short 
17 order regarding the divisions of the two organizations, correct? 
18 Ms. Gordon. I do. On behalf of the organization, I will say Mr. Luelsdorff is not 
19 an appropriate witness for that kind of a question. He is, as I said before, he is a 
20 member, not an officer, of the organization. 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 Q 
A

9 members? And, if so, what does that entail?

11 Q Mr. Luelsdorff, I have a set of questions about the resources and training 
12 provided to 1AP members. Is it your intention to provide the First and Fifth in all

17 
18 A 
Q "Rules, First, and Fifth." 
Mr. Luelsdorff, I have additional questions regarding contacts made by law 16

21

A

Q 
A 
Q "Rules, First, and Fifth." 
Do you believe the 2020 election was stolen? 
"Rules, First, and Fifth." 
Do you believe Joe Biden is the legitimate President of the United States? 
"Rules, First, and Fifth." 
Okay. Mr. Luelsdorff, a letter from your attorney, Ms. Gordon, dated 
7 April 13th, 2022, and marked as exhibit 2 indicates that you refused to produce any 17 
8 documents in response to the committee's subpoena in part based on Fifth Amendment 
9 objections. 
10 I will note for the record in this deposition that your attorney has previously 
11 indicated that this objection applies to the act of production. 
12 Ms. Gordon, did I get that correct? 
13 
14 
15 Ms. Gordon. Yes. That's correct. 
Thank you. 
At this point, Mr. Luelsdorff has asserted First and Fifth Amendment privileges as a 
16 basis to refuse to answer all of the select committee's questions today. Under these 
17 circumstances, we will not close the record on the deposition as the select committee 
18 determines the appropriate course of action to move forward. 
19 Before we go off the record and conclude for today, I will pause to see if any of my 
20 colleagues wish to offer anything else? 
21 Okay. At this time, the deposition will stand in recess subject to the call of the 
22 chair. 
23 Ms. Gordon. I did want to make one final comment. Can you 
24 hear me? 
25 Sure, and just to confirm we're still on the record?  1 
2 The Reporter. Yes, sir, we are on the record. 
Ms. Gordon. Yeah, thank you. As we did in Mr. Lewis' deposition, I want to 
3 make clear that the primary problem that this group and these individuals have with 
4 being deposed by the committee under the First Amendment is that it is compulsory. 18 
5 Many of the questions that you have asked today, we would have been willing to provide 
6 answers to in a voluntary setting. And, as you know, you and I were making efforts 
7 toward arranging certain voluntary interviews, as opposed to a compelled subpoena 
8 process. 
9 And then, on the Fifth Amendment, again, we view this as being something that's 
10 within the committee's control. They're the ones raising the specter of criminal 
11 prosecution, not us. And so both of our objections could easily be overcome, but it 
12 would require the committee to change its legal position versus --vis-a-vis these two
