CNN fact checker claims two of our examples are inaccurate 
This is also incorrect, according to Newton County's Board of Elections. 
A spokesperson for the board told me Blalock's wife voted as "Mrs. James Blalock" which caused the mix up.

This is false. 
The Elections & Voter Registration director in Jackson County, GA tells me that Linda Kesler did not vote --she was 
removed from voter rolls in 2003, when she passed. 
According to the director a completely different person, Lynda Kesler, did legally vote.
