Hi All, 
Thank you for your work on the presidentia l elector project in the litigation states thus 
far. Rudy's team has designated Ken Chesebro as the point person for the legal documents and 
Mike Roman as the lead for executing the voting on Monday. Both are copied here, and can 
assist in resolving the outstanding issues in your states. 
Thanks, 
Josh
