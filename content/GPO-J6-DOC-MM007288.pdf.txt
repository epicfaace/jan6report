Bill-
We completed the AZ analysis you requested. Because of the substantial uncertainty surrounding the 
databases, this is a highly unreliable way to identify ineligible voters. 
Summary: 
Y = SSN available (1,639} 
N = no SSN available (29) 
U = unable to locate the individual in our database based on the input provided (1,015) 
As for records that came back with a "U" flag, keep in mind, just because the expert didn't get a match 
to a SSN based on the input data provided, doesn't mean that the individual doesn't have a SSN and it's 
a case of fraud. There are many sources of data that contribute to the expert's files, including credit 
resources. No SSN available for a record could just mean that the individual doesn't have much or any 
credit activity and that SSN isn't tied to an individual in our file, among other potential reasons. 
For records that come back with "N" flag, that means the expert was unable able to match that record 
on the input data to their database, but were not able to find or confidently tie a SSN to that record. 
Lastly, any records with a "Y" we have a high confidence match and SSN available for that record.
