Dominion Voting Systems 
In short, we can credibly say there's valid questions about the security and reliability of Dominion's systems. 
Important to note they are operating in a number of states, but not necessarily statewide. 
Toplines below, full report attached. 
TOPLINES 
Dominion Voting Systems 
• Dominion Voting Systems is a private company originally founded in Canada, but which now has a 
significant U.S. presence 
• Dominion has headquarters in Colorado under the subsidiary Dominion Voter Systems, Inc. 
• Dominion is reportedly 75% owned by private equity firm Staple Street Capital, 12% owned by it's 
Co-Founder John Poulos, with the remainder owned by other members of the firm's leadership 
• Prior to its 2018 acquisition by Staple Street. the firm appears to have been 100% owned 
by its Canadian parent company, and in turn, that firm's leadership 
• Dominion is the second largest provider of U.S. election systems 
• Dominion provides election hardware and software in 28 states and Puerto Rico 
Foreign Ties/Concerns 
• Dominion Voting Systems was originally a Canadian company, but now has substantial U.S. 
operations 
• Dominion's CEO John Poulos has confirmed that parts of its voting systems are made in China, 
specifically citing LCD screens and small components like capacitors and resistors 
• Dominion has used Serbian software developers, and at one point had an office in Serbia 
• Dominion has been a vendor for elections in The Philippines and Mongolia 
Political Ties/Connections 
• Dominion employees have made less than $1,300 in political contributions, but 93% of those 
contributions have gone to Democratic candidates or committees 
• Dominion has retained lobbyists from Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, including a pair of former 
Democratic aides 
• Brownstein lobbyist Brian McKean previously worked for the Obama campaign and as an 
aide to Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Barbara Boxer 
• Brownstein lobbyist Nadaem Elshami is a former Chief of Staff to Nancy Pelosi 
MM007666  • In 2019, Brownstein lobbyists donated to Sen. Mitch McConnell as the Senate was setto consider 
legislation that would have negatively impacted Dominion and other large voting machine 
vendors; the legislation as ultimately sidelined 
• Staple Street Capital board member William E. Kennard was the Obama Administration's 
Ambassador to the EU 
Rumors/False Allegations 
• Allegations connecting Dominion to Democrats and prominent liberals are based on some real 
connections, but have been overstated 
• George Soros does not own Dominion; Mark Malloch-Brown, who is connected to Soros, is 
the Chairman of Smartmatic, which previously worked with Dominion 
• Dominion donated between $50,000 and $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation, and was 
previously a part of a Clinton Foundation commitment to provide election equipment to 
developing countries 
• Nancy Pelosi's former Chief of Staff, Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck lobbyist Nadeam 
Elshami, currently lobbies for Dominion 
• Blum Capital, the firm of Feinstein (D-CA)'s husband Richard Blum is a previous investor in 
software company Avid Technology which makes election software, but he does not have a 
"financial relationship" with Dominion 
• A conspiracy theory claims secret computer programs called "hammer" and "scorecard" have been 
used to "steal" votes for Biden 
• Chris Krebs, the head of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said that 
this theory was "nonsense" 
• The theory comes from information given by Dennis Montgomery, a former government 
contractor who allegedly 'conned' the Pentagon into paying millions of dollars for anti­
terrorism technology that did not work 
• Associates of Sheriff Joe Arpaio say Montgomery defrauded them by claiming that the 
"Hammer" software program could show a federal judge was "colluding" against Arpaio 
• The theory also claims that a company named VR System siphoned votes in battleground 
states, but VR systems does not make vote-counting machines, and its software was not 
used in the battleground states were votes were allegedly "stolen" 
Technical Failures In The 2020 Election 
• Machines from Dominion Voting Systems did experience technical failures on election night, but 
these errors were reportedly fixed and did not lead to improper vote counts 
• Antrim and Oakland Counties in Michigan counties saw tabulation mistakes that were reportedly 
the result of human error, and the totals were corrected 
• A third Michigan county -which was not using Dominion -also saw a tabulation error 
• Georgia experienced problems on election morning with machines made by Know Ink, a 
subcontractor of Dominion, in the counties of Morgan and Spalding, which prevented voters from 
casting ballots 
MM007667  • The technology glitch was allegedly due to a software upload the night before the election, 
but Dominion has disputed that 
• Election officials extended voting hours and used paper ballots to work around the issue 
Prior Instances Oflssues With Dominion's Machines 
• In 2017 and 2019, hacking conferences were able to successfully hack and exploit vulnerabilities 
in Dominion voting equipment 
• In 2013 and 2019, Texas twice rejected Dominion's voting machines due to both "multiple 
hardware and software issues," with an examiner saying the machines were "fragile and error 
prone" 
• In Georgia's 2020 primary elections, Dominion voting machines saw numerous problems, with 
some being delivered late, some suffering power problems, and other failing to work 
• Dominion's electronic poll books "were plagued by freezing software and user error" 
• Nevada's 2018 primary elections saw more than 300 reported errors from Dominion voting 
machines, including candidates being left off ballots in some instances 
• In 2018, there were reports that Dominion voting machines had overheated in Palm Beach, 
Florida 
• In 2012, Dominion voting machines in Florida awarded two Wellington Village council seats to 
losing candidates due to the machine being set up incorrectly 
Potential Security & Vulnerability Issues 
• Some Dominion voting machines include modems that could potentially connect to the internet, 
posing a hacking vulnerability 
o Dominion has modems in their vote tabulators and scanners 
• The National Institute of Standards and Technology recommend that voting systems do not have 
wireless connections, since it makes it possible to connect them to external networks
