2 Mr.- Good afternoon. 
3 This is a transcribed interview of Thomas Paul Conover, conducted by the House 
4 Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol 
5 pursuant to House Resolution 503. 
6 At this time, I'd ask the witness to please state your full name and spell your last 
7 name for the record. 
8 
9 
10 name. 
11 
12 Mr. Conover. Thomas Paul Conover, Jr., C-o-n-o-v-e-r. 
Mr. - Thank you very much. And I apologize if I mispronounced your last 
Mr. Conover. That's okay. 
Mr.- This will be a staff-led interview. And members may join --I don't 
13 see any on right now, but if they join, they are also able to ask questions. 
14 
15 is 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 So, speaking is , and in the room with me today 
Mr.- How's it going? Good afternoon. 
Mr.- We also --yeah, that's it for who we have. 
At this time, could counsel please state your name for the record? 
Ms. Wagner. Camille Wagner. Good afternoon. 
Mr.- Good afternoon. 3 
21 There is an official reporter transcribing the record of this interview. Please wait 
22 until each question is completed before you begin your response, and we will try to wait 
23 until your response is complete before we ask our next question. The stenographer 
24 cannot record nonverbal responses, such as shaking your head, so it is important that you 
25 answer each question with an audible, verbal response.  4 
1 We ask that you provide complete answers based on your best recollection. If a 
2 question is not clear, please ask for clarification. If you do not know the answer, just say 
3 so. 
4 And then just a couple of things to note other than that. 
5 First, it's important that you understand that this interview is voluntary. If at any 
6 time you would like to stop speaking with us, that is your choice. Similarly, if at any 
7 point you need to discuss something with your attorney in private, please let us know, 
8 and we will take a break so you can have that conversation. 
9 Second, this interview is not under oath, but because this is a formal congressional 
10 investigation, as we tell all of our witnesses, you are obligated under Federal law to tell 
11 the truth, the same as if you were speaking with the FBI or the Department of Justice. 
12 It is unlawful to deliberately provide false information to Congress. For this 
13 interview, providing false information could result in criminal penalties for false 
14 statements. Do you understand? 
15 
16 Mr. Conover. Yes, sir. 
Mr.- Third, you are not obligated to keep the fact of this interview and 
17 what we discuss confidential. You are free to tell whomever you wish that you met with 
18 us, including the prosecutor or judge in your case, or you can tell no one at all. That is 
19 your decision. 
20 Fourth, the select committee is separate and independent from the Department 
21 of Justice. We have no involvement with the prosecutions, and DOJ is not a partner 
22 with the select committee in its investigation. 
23 The select committee also is not a party to your criminal case and is not agreeing 
24 to submit anything on your behalf to the judge, nor can we make any representation 
25 whether, if you tell the judge you met with us, that the judge will be more favorable to  5 
1 you during sentencing. 
2 Fifth, we have agreed with Ms. Wagner not to share the substance of what you 
3 say with the Department of Justice prior to your sentencing, but there are two possible 
4 exceptions. If you told us about evidence of a crime that we thought law enforcement 
5 was unaware of or if we had reason to believe you lied during this interview, then we 
6 would be obligated to tell the Department of Justice or another appropriate law 
7 enforcement agency. 
8 And if you tell the judge that you met with us, please understand that may prompt 
9 questions from the judge about what you said and whether it is consistent with your prior 
10 statements and acceptance of responsibility. And if the judge starts asking questions, 
11 we may get asked to respond and divulge what you said. 
12 And, just logistically, let us know if you need any breaks or you would ever like to 
13 take a pause and discuss something with Ms. Wagner. If that's the case, we would 
14 mute, go off record for a little bit so you two can have that conversation in private. 
15 And if there's ever a moment where or I ask a question at the same 
16 time and you can't hear us or, like I said, we're not clear, just let us know, and we will ask 
17 the question again. 
18 Does that all make sense? 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 Mr. Conover. Yes, sir. 
Mr.- Great. 
And any questions before we begin, Ms. Wagner? 
Ms. Wagner. No. You may proceed. 
Mr.- Great.

5 
6 
7 Q So we'll start off with just a little bit of background information. 
How old are you, Paul? 
A Fifty-three. 
Q And where do you currently live? 
A Keller, Texas. 
Q Have you always lived in Keller, Texas? 
A No. I grew up in Irving and moved to Hurst and then to Keller. I've been 
8 in the same area, same 25-mile radius for my entire life. 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 Q Great. And what is your educational background? 
A I went to one semester of college. 
Q Okay. And what do you do for a living? 
A 
Q 
A 
Q I fix hail damage on cars. It's called paintless dent repair. 
Is that your only job currently or --
Yeah. Yes, sir. Sorry. 
No, that's okay. Thank you. 
16 Now we're going to talk a little bit about the lead-up to January 6th. 
17 So, in general, how would you describe your level of political engagement during 
18 former President Trump's first term, so, like, 2016 to right before the 2020 election? 
19 A I'd never really been politically active. I went to one rally that he had with 6 
20 my mother in Dallas, and then I went to January 6th. That's the only real political things 
21 I've ever done, other than, you know, maybe Face book or something. But I've never 
22 been active in any kind of politics other than that. 
23 Q Thank you. Did you pay a lot of attention to politics during former 
24 President Trump's first term? 
25 A I started to. Yeah. I mean, it was all over the news, so yeah. More than  7 
1 any other one, I guess. 
2 Q Okay. And when you say "news," was that television? Was it the 
3 internet? Was it print sources? 
4 A I would have to say all of the above. 
5 Q Okay. Talking about the news specifically, so on the television, did you pay 
6 attention to local news or national news or both? 
7 
8 
9 A Both. 
Q One or the other more so, or --
A No, I tried to be balanced. I watched CNN, MSNBC, FOX, the local channels. 
10 I even watched C-SPAN. 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 Q Thank you. 
In terms of internet sources, were those newspapers or other print media online? 
A Yeah, I would say, like, Yahoo or MSN, CNN, FOX, kind of the same things. 
Q Okay. And did you read print publications too? 
A Every once in a while. We don't have a lot of papers. Like, if I was at a 
16 hotel or something like that and they had a free newspaper, then, yes, sir. 
17 Q Great. 
18 So I'm going to list off a bunch of social media applications that might be used for 
19 news, and just, you know, let me know if you've used them. 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 A Okay. 
Q Facebook? 
A Yes. 
Q Parler? 
A No. I think I tried to get an account and it didn't work. 
Q Okay. And just so I can orient you again, we're talking before the 2020  1 election still, so --
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 
10 A No, I didn't have Parler before the 2020 election. 
Q Great. Reddit? 
A Maybe if it was used as a source on one of the other ones. 
Q Okay. Telegram? 
A No. 
Q Twitter? 
A 
Q 
A No. I've got an account, but I never could figure Twitter out. 
Fair enough. Gettr, spelled G-e-t-t-r? 
I think I opened up an account after the election, but, no, I don't really get 
11 on Gettr. 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
24 
25 Q Thank you. 
Did you watch a lot of news on VouTube? 
A No, not really. Funny videos on VouTube. 
Q Cats? A lot of cat videos? 
I'm just kidding. That's not a question. 
Did you ever look at thedonald.win? 
A No. 
Q Gab? 
A I don't think so, no. 
Q Wimkin, W-i-m-k-i-n? 
A No. 
Q Have you heard of 4chan? 
A Four chain? 
Q 4chan. 8  1 
2 
3 
4 A 
Q 
A 
Q No. 
Okay. 
No. 
That's fine. 
5 So, considering that list of social media sites, news sites, or news aggregate sites, 
6 did you use any of them more than the others? 
7 
8 
9 media? 
10 
11 know. A 
Q 
A No, I don't think so. 
Would you say that you got a lot of political information from any social 
No. I don't really trust social media. I mean, you see stuff, but --you 
12 So, to clarify, you mentioned a bunch of news sources earlier. 
13 Were you going to those websites independently or were you finding those articles on 
14 Face book? 
15 Mr. Conover. No. I find --I have CNN, MSNBC, Yahoo, MSN.com, those are all 9 
16 on my --either in the Yahoo thing on my phone or an actual app. Like I said, I'm not real 
17 tech-savvy, so a lot of that stuff you said earlier, I have no idea what it is. 
18 BYMR.-
19 
20 
21 Q Got it. 
Did you ever follow former President Trump on social media? 
A Again, I think I probably tried to on Twitter, but I didn't get that. I can't 
22 remember if I was on his Facebook or not. Yeah, I don't remember really. I might've 
23 been on his Facebook, but I didn't --I didn't Facebook to him. 
24 Q Okay. So fair to say that, even if you did follow him, it wasn't something 
25 you were paying close attention to?  10 
1 A No. I paid more close attention to, like I said, the FOX News, CNN, MSNBC, 
2 Yahoo, MSN.com, kind of the major ones, like ABC local, CBS. You know, I'd watch 
3 "60 Minutes" sometimes. 
4 Q Understood. 
5 So would you say, then, that the 2020 election, did that change your political 
6 engagement at all? 
7 
8 A No, not the election itself. No. 
Q Okay. So, right after the 2020 election, did you think that the election was 
9 stolen from former President Trump? 
10 
11 
12 A No. 
Q You did not? 
A I did not think it was stolen from President Trump. I actually think that's 
13 one of the dumbest things I ever heard. 
14 Q Okay. 
15 So I guess, then, after the 2020 election, did you participate in any rallies or any 
16 other political activities? 
17 
18 
19 A No, not --well, January 6th. 
Q Yeah. 
A And I've been to nothing else since then, no. And, like I said, the only other 
20 thing that I'd ever been to was a rally that Trump had in Dallas, and I believe that was the 
21 American Airlines Center. I went with my mom. 
22 Q So, just for the record, then, you did not attend either the November 14th 
23 rally in Washington, D.C., or the December 12th rally in Washington, D.C., to contest the 
24 results of the 2020 election? 
25 A No, sir, I did not.  1 
2 Q Okay. Thank you. 
And I assume the answer to this is "no," but for the record: Between the 2020 11 
3 election and up until January 6th, were you making any political donations to groups that 
4 were contesting the 2020 election results? 
5 A No. Any political donations I ever made I believe were to the Trump 
6 campaign or the RNC, and not a lot of that. 
7 Q Okay. 
8 So, then, at the beginning of December 2020, how would you describe your, sort 
9 of, level of political engagement? 
10 A Not --didn't really have a whole lot. You know, I'd get on Facebook and 
11 mouth off a little bit, but, I mean, I'm not a --I never went to, like, rallies or stood on 
12 street corners or anything like that. 
13 Q Well, were you thinking a lot about politics at that time? Was it, you know, 
14 something that came to mind a lot? 
15 
16 
17 
18 
19 
20 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q No, not really. 
Okay. 
I mean --
So --
--I don't dwell on it. 
Sorry. 
21 Why don't we talk a little bit, then, about factors that might've influenced your 
22 decision to travel to Washington, D.C., for the January 6th rally. 
23 Can you tell me what you were --like, what was your reasoning for wanting to go 
24 to D.C.? 
25 A Well, the whole thing started off --as I said, I do paintless dent repair.  12 
1 We're a group of guys that travels all over, chasing hail storms. So, you know, I know 
2 people from all over the country. 
3 Originally, there was supposed to be six or eight of us that were going. And I 
4 figured we were going to go to the hotel, you know, have some drinks, eat, maybe play 
5 some cards, and go to the rally the next day. It wasn't until probably 2 days before that 
6 that it ended up just being two of us going. 
7 
8 Q Okay. 
So let's back up a little bit. When did you decide to go to Washington, D.C., for 
9 January 6th? 
10 A I don't even think we talked about it until maybe a week or two before that 
11 happened. And I could be wrong with that. It might've been a week. But, you know, 
12 we have a --you know, we all talk on Facebook, and that's all --that's really all I 
13 remember, is talking. There was going to be a handful of guys going. 
14 And I know that I --I believe I called the hotel couple days before we left to make 
15 sure that their bar was open and the restaurant. And, at that time, they were. 
16 
17 
18 Q 
A Do you remember why your group wanted to go to Washington, D.C.? 
More of a curiosity factor, I guess. 
And, like I said, we do --our gig is kind of --you know, it's when it hails. So 
19 there's a lot of times where, the winter, you know, we hunt. We're not working because 
20 it's cold. 
21 I generally, before COVID, in January, I leave for Australia and I work in Australia, 
22 because our winter is their summer. So I usually go over there and work 3 or 4 months. 
23 So, pre-COVID, I wouldn't have even been in town January 6th. 
24 
25 Q Okay. 
Did you want to go to Washington, D.C., because --let me rephrase.  13 
1 Did you know that on January 6th Congress would be certifying the electoral count 
2 in the Presidential election for Joe Biden? 
3 A I think I figured that out when I got there, but it wasn't really on the --that's 
4 not why I went. 
5 Q Okay. 
6 So I've pulled up your statement of facts from your docket, and it seems you had a 
7 conversation with someone named Blakely on December 12th, 2020. 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 A Yeah. 
Q Do you remember that conversation? 
A No. 
Q Who is Blakely? 
A Yeah, I know Blakely. He's in my --we're in the same business. He has a 
13 shop too. 
14 Q Okay. Is he one of the six or eight people that you referenced earlier that 
15 you thought you were going to D.C. with? 
16 
17 
18 
19 docket. A He was the one that I ended up going with. 
Q Okay. 
So, on December 12th --I'm going to read to you from here. This is from your 
20 So Blakely says, "No don't tar and feather go to Washington on the 6th of January 
21 and take our country back." "I'm planning on flying in on the 5th and returning the 7th 
22 hopefully." 
23 
24 
25 And you responded, "I'll go. Where we staying?" 
Do you remember that? 
A I didn't realize --I do now. I didn't realize that it was that many weeks  14 
1 before January 6th. 
2 Q So, then, you were talking with --were you just talking with Blakely or were 
3 you talking with the whole group in early December about going to Washington, D.C.? 
4 A He was telling me that some other people were going, and I think --I think 
5 that I remember seeing some of the other guys saying on Face book that they were going. 
6 But I know that that came up in conversations that me and Blakely had. 
7 Q Why did you think it was important to be in Washington, D.C., on 
8 January 6th? 
9 A Something to do. I mean, I had no real preconceived notions. It was 
10 winter, it was cold, it was boring. I wasn't working at the time. 
11 
12 Q Okay. Do you know where Blakely got the idea? 
A No, I couldn't speak to him. But I would assume that it was --people were 
13 talking about going. 
Do you have any -- 14 
15 Q 
A But, no, I don't really get --I really don't know why his --what prompted him 
16 to go either. 
17 Q What did you think he meant when he was talking about tarring and 
18 feathering and, you know, not sitting around, going to actually D.C.? What did you think 
19 that he was implying? 
A He's kind of a smart aleck like me. 
Q What do you mean by that? 20 
21 
22 A He's just kind of a smart aleck. I didn't honestly believe that he wanted to 
23 tar and feather somebody. 
24 BY MR. 
25 Q But he does say --and this is He does say "take our  15 
1 country back." So what does that mean? 
2 A I guess --I can't speak to what he says, but I didn't really take that as he was 
3 going to take the country back. People say stupid things. I said --I said some pretty 
4 stupid things. 
5 Q No. And I'm not literally meaning take the country back, even though 
6 that's almost what happened on January 6th. 
7 I guess the question is, what is going through your mind where it's relevant to go 
8 to the D.C. on January 6th? You said earlier you didn't think that the election had been 
9 stolen, so what's the point of even going to D.C., is I guess what we're trying to figure out. 
10 A Well, as I said earlier, my --you know, my hail season is kind of a seasonal 
11 thing, and I hadn't been working. You know, it was cold. It was right after Christmas. 
12 People don't fix their cars that time of the year. And I was bored. 
13 Q Okay. Then why didn't you go to New York City? 
14 
15 guess. 
16 
17 
18 A 
Q 
A 
Q Because we decided to go to Washington because that's where Trump was, I 
Okay. 
I wish I would've went to New York City now. 
So President Trump played an impact in you wanting to come to 
19 Washington, D.C. Is that fair to say? 
20 
21 
22 A 
Q 
23 that time? 
24 
25 A 
Q That's fair to say. 
BYMR-
And you said other people were talking about going to January 6th around 
Yep. 
Did you hear any of those conversations?  16 
1 A No. I just remember seeing stuff on Facebook. I don't think that I talked 
2 on the phone to anybody really, I don't think. 
3 Q Do you remember if what you saw on Face book was around December 12th 
4 or was it later in December? Do you remember? 
5 A I --no. I didn't believe that that was on --you know, I didn't know that we 
6 were talking about going to January that early. So I thought it was a week or two before 
7 the election, but that's 3, 4 weeks, I guess. 
8 Q And I know you said you don't use Twitter a lot, but you did just answer Mr. 
9 -'s question by saying President Trump was a factor in going to Washington, D.C. 
10 Do you remember former President Trump tweeting on December 19th about a wild 
11 protest? 
12 A No. I never --like I said, I never figured Twitter out, so I'm not on there. 
13 think I have an account. I might've deleted it a while back. But I never could figure out 
14 all the hashtag stuff. 
15 Q Do you remember anyone else talking about a wild protest in D.C. on 
16 January 6th? 
17 
18 A 
Q No, not really. 
Okay. 
19 So, on December 24, 2020 --this is, again, from your docket --you have a post on 
20 social media, I think it's Facebook, where you said, quote, "Going to Washington DC with 
21 Blakely to join the mob Jan 5th cmon join us." 
22 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A 
Q Yep. 
Do you remember that post? 
I do. Well, after I saw it, yes. 
So this is December 24th. At that time, what did you think was happening  17 
1 in Washington, D.C.? 
2 A As I've said earlier, I thought it was going to be a handful of people going. 
3 We were going to eat, drink, be merry, and maybe play some cards and go see Trump. 
4 Q Then what did you mean by "mob"? 
5 A Mob. I don't know. Just a figure of speech. I didn't think we were going 
6 with the mafia or anything like that. 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A No, but do you agree that "mob" can also mean a large group of people? 
Yep. 
Do you agree that "mob" can also mean a large group of unruly people? 
Sure. 
So --
It can mean a whole lot of Italians, or it can mean a whole lot of soccer fans. 
13 It could mean a lot of things, yes. 
14 Mr.- I have a question. 
15 So doesn't "mob," doesn't that, though, insinuate something disorderly? 
16 Mr. Conover. Well, it can insinuate a lot of things based on the context that you 
17 use it, I would say. 
18 Mr- Well, you just said you weren't talking about the mafia. So the word 
19 "mob," as far as I know, is only a large group of unruly or disruptive people. So how 
20 were you using "mob"? 
21 Mr. Conover. Well, when a bunch of us get together and go hunting, it's a mob. 
22 We've got a fishing mob that we go fishing with. I'm from Texas. "Mob" means a lot of 
23 things in Texas. 
24 Mr.- So, when you go fishing, you say "I'm going out fishing with a mob 
25 of friends"? You say that?  1 Mr. Conover. Well, I say that --if somebody asks and I'm going with a mob, 
2 which is three or four of my buddies, yes, I do say that. 
3 Mr.- But that's --it's a very direct question. When you're talking 
4 about going fishing with your friends in Texas, you say, "I'm going out with my mob of 
5 friends to go fishing"? You say that? 
6 
7 
8 
9 Mr. Conover. No. I actually say --"Who are you fishing with?" "The mob." 
BYMR.-
Q Is the mob a specific group of people? 
A Generally, yes. 18 
10 Q Can you name --is the mob the group of people that you were supposed to 
11 go to Washington, D.C., with? 
12 
13 A No. No, absolutely not. None of them would've gone to --no. 
Q Okay. So, then, how are you using "mob" in this context, then, if it's not 
14 the specific group of people --
15 A Well, as you said earlier, a mob can be just a group of people or it can be an 
16 unruly group of people. I think that I was saying --I was using it in the context of a 
17 group of people. 
18 Q I'm sorry if I misrepresented that. A mob is --unless I'm mistaken, a mob is 
19 an unruly group of people. It is a specific adjective for a group of people that has moved 
20 beyond, sort of, the norms of society. 
21 So why did you use that term? 
22 A Well, I guess I didn't realize that that's all that it meant. As I said, it's used 
23 loosely for other things. I didn't intend that we were going to be necessarily with a 
24 group of unruly people. 
25 Q Okay.  So who were you asking to join you? 
Whoever was on Face book, I guess. 
And why did you want --
1 mean, that --
Sorry. Please let me finish. Why did you want them to join you? 19 
1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A As I said earlier, I thought that it was going to be a group of people, that we 
7 were going to go and eat, drink, play some cards, and be merry. I had no intention or 
8 forethought of going to be unruly or anything like that. 
9 Q So you posted this on Facebook. You wanted, sort of, anyone on Facebook 
10 to come join you, or join the --
11 
12 
13 
14 A 
Q 
A 
Q Yep. 
--mob in Washington, D.C.? 
Yep. 
And you said President Trump brought you to Washington, D.C. Did you 
15 want people to come join you in some sort of protest for President Trump? 
16 A I wasn't really there to protest President Trump or --you know, I just 
17 generically put out --I don't know if you have access to my Facebook, but I think, one day, 
18 I put a recipe for barn owl out, and I didn't really want people to go shoot barn owls and 
19 cook them. 
20 I'm kind of a smart aleck, as I said earlier. A lot of my posts on Facebook are 
21 joking and, you know, whimsical and out there. I don't actually want people to go shoot 
22 a barn owl and then cook it. 
23 Q But you did want people to join you in Washington, D.C., or was that another 
24 whimsical --
25 A Well, no, I wanted some people to come. Like I said earlier, you know, I  1 thought it was going to be a handful of friends that were going to come out there and --
2 
3 
4 Q Okay. 
A --eat, drink, and be merry. 
Q So that was December 24th, that post. Before January 6th, were you 
5 looking at any websites or social media to find out information about what was 
6 happening in Washington, D.C., on January 6th? 
7 
8 
9 A 
Q 
A No, I don't think so. 
Did you know what was planned for Washington, D.C., on January 6th? 
No. I had no idea, other than just going to be there. I didn't know any 
10 Proud Boys or anti---any Black Lives Matter or any of those fringe, extremist groups at 
11 all. 20 
12 Q Not even talking about those groups, but just generally, did you know there 
13 would be a rally for former President Trump? 
14 
15 A Yes. That's explicitly why I think we went there. 
Q Okay. Well, before, you said you went to play cards, eat and drink, and be 
16 merry. So did you actually want people to come join you to do that or to go to the rally? 
17 A Okay. I think what I said earlier was we were going to eat, drink, be merry, 
18 and go see Trump, I believe was exactly what I said. 
19 Mr.-1 have a followup. 
20 So you first talk about going to Washington, D.C., on December 12th of 2020. 
21 President Trump didn't even mention the rally on January 6th until December 19th of 
22 2020. 
23 So help us understand why you're coming to D.C. before it's even announced that 
24 President Trump's having a rally. 
25 Mr. Conover. Well, somebody must have told me, because that's why I was  1 going. I don't know actually when it was announced or anything like that. 
2 BYMR.-
3 Q Do you know if your friend Blakely went to any political rallies before 
4 January 6th? 
5 A I have no idea. 
6 Q I guess, because he's the one who told you on December 12th about the 
7 January 6th rally. So we're trying to figure out where you got the information about 
8 January 6th and --
9 
10 A 
Q Obviously from him. 
Right. So were you talking to him before you went to Washington, D.C., 
11 about what would happen in Washington, D.C.? 21 
12 A No, I don't think we ever discussed any plans of what was happening, other 
13 than that we were going. I had no preconceived ideas or notions about anything that 
14 was going to happen. 
15 
16 
17 Q Okay. 
When did you land --or, sorry. When did you arrive in Washington, D.C.? 
A I believe it was in the evening, because I remember driving in in the Uber 
18 and thinking it was kind of cool to see all those buildings. 
19 
20 
21 Q 
A 
Q Evening of January 5th? 
Yes. I believe so. 
Okay. So, on January 5th, you posted another message, and I quote: 
22 "Shit storm is coming but that's what the Democrats want." 
23 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A Yeah, I regret saying that. I should've said "Democrats and Republicans." 
But you didn't; you wrote "Democrats." So can you explain that post? 
No. Not other than being a smart aleck.  22 
1 Q So I understand that you're being a smart aleck, but there has to be a reason 
2 that you were posting this. So what information are you getting that is leading you to 
3 post this? 
4 A Just something that came in my head. I had no information other than just 
5 saying that. I don't know. Sometimes things come out of my mouth. 
6 Mr.- So, Mr. Conover, I'm just going to cut straight to the chase. 
7 When we talk with folks, we use our common sense and ways of the world. 
8 understand --
9 
10 Mr. Conover. Okay. 
Mr. - --joking here and there. I do. But saying, "A shit storm is 
11 coming because that's what the Democrats want," that's not being a smart aleck, so what 
12 did you mean by that? 
13 
14 
15 Mr. Conover. I had no --I don't know. I don't know what I meant by that. 
BYMR-
Q When you were talking to your friend Blakely, was he saying anything about 
16 a shit storm coming? 
17 
18 A 
Q I can't recollect him saying anything like that. 
Well, as Mr. - said, like, there's joking, and then that's a very specific 
19 thing to say as you arrive in a city to attend a political rally for a President contesting an 
20 election with a lot of people. 
21 And I'll just represent this to you. You might not have been on social media, as 
22 you say, but there was a lot of discussion about January 6th, as President Trump tweeted 
23 being a wild protest. 
24 So can you please try to remember, what gave you the sense that a shit storm was 
25 coming?  23 
1 A I believe that people were going --there was going to be a bunch of people 
2 there protesting. 
3 Q And where did you get that idea? 
I guess from the news. I guess from the news. I mean -- 4 
5 A 
Q Okay. So, if you expected a bunch of people to be protesting, why did you 
6 say "shit storm"? 
7 A I can't answer that question. I don't know. I don't know why I used that 
8 particular term. 
9 
10 Q 
A Why did you think Democrats wanted whatever was coming? 
I can't really answer that question. I don't really know what was going on 
11 in my head right then. 
12 I know that the Democrats had been arguing against the Republicans, the 
13 Republicans had been running --arguing against them. So I think it was more of an 
14 us-versus-them kind of situation. 
15 BYMR.-
16 Q Was it an us-versus-them situation in regards to certifying the election? Is 
17 that what the us-versus-them was? 
18 A No. I think it was Republicans against Democrats. As I said earlier, I 
19 wouldn't have been --I wouldn't have agreed to overturn an election. I don't believe --I 
20 don't believe the election was stolen from Trump. I think Trump's mouth cost him the 
21 election. 
Q So, then, why are you coming to D.C.? 22 
23 I guess, we just don't understand this, right? You're talking about a shit storm's 
24 coming. You're talking about Democrats. January 6th just happens to be the day that 
25 Congress certifies the election. None of this is adding up.  24 
1 A I don't know what to tell you, why it's not adding up. I mean, I went 
2 there --I don't know what to tell you. I wish I wouldn't have gone. 
Q That's different than why you went in the first place. 
Ms. Wagner. May I interject briefly? 
Mr. l!!!!l!!!!l!!!!!!!II Yes, please. 3 
4 
5 
6 Ms. Wagner. If you all pull up the statement of offense that we agreed to when 
7 Mr. Conover took the plea --and I'm trying to pull it up myself; give me one second --and 
8 you look at paragraph 8, that was a paragraph that myself and the prosecutor reworded 
9 to state that the purpose of the defendant's trip to Washington, D.C., was to protest 
10 Congress on the day Congress was certifying the electoral college vote. 
11 The way that this sentence was originally phrased is to protest the certification of 
12 the electoral college, which is not what Mr. Conover's purpose was for going to D.C. His 
13 purpose for going to D.C. is to protest Congress in general. 
14 With that said, Paul, [inaudible] their questions. 
15 Mr- Okay. 
16 So, as you --
17 
18 Mr. Conover. I'm sorry? I'm sorry, counselor? 
Mr. - I was going to say, as Ms. Wagner can appreciate, our 
19 investigation is a little bit more expansive than the DOJ's, right? So we're not 
20 necessarily tied to the statement of facts, though I do appreciate the way it's written. 
21 We're just trying to have him explain it. 
22 Ms. Wagner. Right. And I --
23 Mr.- So thank you for pointing that out. 
24 
25 Ms. Wagner. --understand that completely. 
So, Paul, just answer their question as honestly as you can, okay?  25 
1 Mr. Conover. I am trying to. They're trying to point me in a way that I'm not 
2 gonna go. 
3 BYMR.-
4 Q I would like to say that we're not trying to point you in a certain way. And 
5 based on your statement of offense, you were there to protest Congress. I asked you 
6 why you were there; you said to attend a rally for President Trump, to drink and be 
7 merry, to play some cards. None of those words involved "to protest Congress." So 
8 we're trying to figure out why you were there. 
9 Were you there to protest Congress? 
10 
11 
12 A 
Q 
A That I definitely was there for. 
Why were you there to protest Congress specifically? 
Because Congress hadn't been doing anything for the American people for 
13 the last 4 years, other than arguing back and forth, Republicans and Democrats alike. 
14 That's what I kind of alluded to earlier when I said I wish I wouldn't have said a shit 
15 storm's coming for the Democrats, because it wasn't just the Democrats; it was the 
16 Republicans too. Nothing happened in Congress for 4 years. 
17 Q Understood. Did you --
18 
19 
20 A 
Q On both sides. 
I hear you. 
Did you expect something to happen that day? Did you expect --you know, 
21 there was a protest --a rally --sorry --a rally for President Trump. Did you expect all of 
22 those people to also have your views about Congress? 
23 A No, I had --everybody had a whole lot of different views about Congress, but 
24 that was a big part of it. I didn't hear a lot of people trying to overturn the election. As 
25 a matter of fact, a lot of people that I thought --or that --they thought that was one of  26 
1 the dumbest things they'd ever heard too. I wouldn't have been behind trying to 
2 overturn an election. 
3 Q Right. But you were there to protest Congress, both parties not doing 
4 anything. But you attended a rally for President Trump to contest the election. 
5 So why did you expect that that protest was where --why did you think that 
6 protest was where you needed to be? 
7 A Again, I went there with no preconceived notions. I don't know --I didn't 
8 have that thought. So there might've been a lot of people there to go do that, but that 
9 wasn't what I was doing, or that --that wasn't on my mind. I think that that's stupid. 
10 Q Okay. 
11 And this was implied, but, for the record, did you travel with your friend Blakely to 
12 Washington, D.C.? 
13 
14 
15 A I did. 
Q And you --
A That's the first time I'd ever traveled with him or done anything in public 
16 with him, as a matter of fact. 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 city? 
23 
24 
25 Q Okay. And you drove there from Texas? 
A 
Q 
A I'm sorry? 
Did you drive there or fly there from Texas? 
Flew. 
Q Okay. Do you remember if you stayed in the city itself or outside of the 
A No, I stayed in the city at either a Hyatt or a Hilton. 
Q Okay. 
And you said you arrived the night of January 5th. Did you observe any other  1 rallies or anything going on on the night of January 5th? 
2 A No. We drove in and it was eerily quiet. I remember seeing all the 
3 landmarks and just kind of being in awe. 
4 
5 
6 Q Okay. So you don't --
A And then --
Q Sorry. Please let me --you didn't see any protests at plazas or any 
7 altercations between groups? 
8 
9 
10 rally? 
11 
12 
13 A I did not. 
Q So, fair to say you did not expect there to be violence at the January 6th 
A That is very fair to say. 
Q Great. 
So let's talk about January 6th itself then. You attended the rally at the Ellipse, 
14 correct? 
15 
16 
17 A That's correct. 
Q Do you remember about what time you got there? 
A I know that we got there, I believe, 11:30ish. I don't --no, I don't really 
18 remember. 
But before President Trump took the stage? 27 
19 
20 Q 
A I think we got there right around the time he was getting there, because we 
21 had to walk. 
22 
23 
24 
25 Q Okay. So was he the only speaker you wanted to see at the rally? 
A Yes. 
Q And you did listen --you did hear him speak, then, correct? 
A I heard him speak for a while. I had to go to the restroom, so at some point  28 
1 I actually walked back to the hotel and went to the restroom and then came back. 
Q Okay. 2 
3 So, when you were listening, do you remember this sentence: "And if you don't 
4 fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore"? 
5 
6 A 
Q I don't remember that specific sentence, no. 
Do you remember that sort of sentiment about fighting for the country, 
7 taking back the country, that kind of thing? 
8 
9 A 
Q No, not really --I mean, no. 
Do you remember President Trump mentioning that attendees would march 
10 to the Capitol and that he would join them? 
11 A We actually left early. I heard that later on, but I believe we headed out 
12 before he actually quit speaking. 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 on? 
18 Q Okay. 
Before we get to you leaving, were you talking to other people at the rally? 
A 
Q 
A Yes. 
Do you remember what they were talking about or what they were focused 
I talked to --one of the other reasons that I was upset with Congress was all 
19 the money that they were spending. And I had a conversation with an older man and 
20 lady, and she professed to be at some university there, one of the --I don't remember 
21 which one she said it was, but she was some kind of professor of economics and, you 
22 know, bills and things like that. 
23 And she kept asking me if I knew how much 1.2 trillion was, or 1.9 trillion, and I 
24 said, "Yeah, that's a lot of money." And, then, after asking me the same question two or 
25 three times, I finally said, "Well, it's [inaudible]."  29 
1 And, to make a long story short, she was talking about the bills in Congress, but 
2 she said, "Did you know that if you had 10 --if you had 10 bills and $1,000, how much 
3 would each one of those bills get?" I said, "That's pretty easy. $100." She said, "Yes, 
4 but what if A only needed $50 and B needed $150?" And I said, "Well, they would just 
5 take the 50 that was left over from A and give it to B," and she goes, "No. A still has to 
6 spend that $100, and B gets to go back and get more." She was trying to explain to me, I 
7 think, that $1.2 trillion isn't really $1.2 trillion, you know? 
8 There was a lot of people that were talking about waste in Congress, stuff like 
9 that. I mean, it was kind of like going to a, I don't know, State fair or something. There 
10 was all kinds of people saying all kinds of things. 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 Q Okay. So you had some good economics lessons. 
Did anyone talk about Vice President Pence? 
A I didn't hear any of that until afterwards. 
Q Anyone around you talk about the certification of the electoral college vote? 
A No. 
Q And do you remember President Trump talking about Vice President Pence 
17 during his speech? 
18 A I don't remember that, but I wouldn't have agreed with that at all. You 
19 know, I feel maybe he was hurt that he lost the election, but, you know --no, I didn't 
20 really hear any of that. I did afterwards. And I disagree with it wholeheartedly. 
21 Q Did you tell anybody around you or talk to anybody around you about how 
22 you didn't believe the election was stolen? 
23 A I'm sure I did. I mean, you know, people have been --they were talking 
24 about stealing the election or voter fraud. You know, there's been voter fraud in every 
25 election since they've been putting paper ballots into a box. That doesn't mean that you  30 
1 can overturn an election. 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 Q Okay. Do you remember how anybody responded if you did tell them that? 
A No. I don't --no. 
Q Okay. 
So let's talk about why you decided to leave the rally early. Do you remember? 
A Nope, other than it was kind of cold. And I think I had to go to the 
7 bathroom again. I have some medical issues. 
8 Q Sorry to hear that, but --so did you have a --sorry, let me rephrase. 
9 Did you already decide to go to the Capitol before you attended President Trump's 
10 rally? 
11 
12 
13 A No. 
Q Why did you decide to go there after leaving the rally? 
A We actually went to the hotel, and we were watching the news, and we 
14 could kind of see the mo---or, the crowd of people going towards the Capitol. And I 
15 can't remember what time we headed that way, but we actually went from the hotel to 
16 the Capitol then. 
17 
18 Q Why did you want to go to the Capitol at that point? 
A I just saw a bunch of people, and, you know, we decided to go. I had no 
19 preconceived notion or anything like that. We just went over there. It was maybe 
20 500 yards. 
21 Q So you're watching on news. You're seeing a lot of people marching 
22 towards the Capitol. You wanted to join them? 
23 
24 
25 A Yeah, I wanted to go see what was going on. 
Q Did you see any violence or hear of any reports of violence at that time? 
A I think when we were getting close to the Capitol I heard some police  31 
1 officers talking about a fight on the --I don't know if it was the east side or the west side, 
2 where the inauguration was being held. 
3 
4 
5 Q That's the west side, but did not expect you to know that --
A Yeah. 
Q --off the top of your head. 
6 So, when you were heading towards the Capitol, were you aware that people had 
7 already made their way inside? 
8 A I don't think that I was aware until I got there, but I can't remember if we 
9 saw something on TV that said that or not. But I didn't go to the --did you say it was the 
10 east side where the inauguration is? 
11 
12 
13 Q West side. 
A Okay. I went to the east side. I never went to the west side. 
Q So you posted --I'm not sure when, but it was after January 6th. You said, 
14 "Fun fact: The Capitol was breached before the President was finished speaking." 
15 And you let me know that you left the rally before the President was finished 
16 speaking. 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 A Yep. 
Q So did you know that at the time that you headed to the Capitol --
A No. 
Q --or find out later? 
A No. I learned that afterwards. 
Q Okay. So what were you expecting to happen when you were heading to 
23 the Capitol? 
24 
25 A I had no preconceived notions about anything happening. 
Q What were you seeing on your way there?  1 
2 A People walking. 
Q And you mentioned hearing about a fight. Do you remember how you 
3 learned about that fight? 32 
4 A We were walking by some police officers on motorcycles. I don't know that 
5 street right there. And then I guess there was some muffled radio transmission, and one 
6 of the officers said that there was some kind of a fight with police officers, and one of the 
7 police officers may have been hurt or something. I mean, I was just kind of overhearing 
8 them talking, I guess. 
9 
10 Q And that didn't deter you from wanting to go to the Capitol? 
A No, I was --it was right there on the street and --no, I mean, I really didn't 
11 think about it. I was just taking things in. 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 Q Were you with Blakely at this time? 
A Yes. 
Q Were you meeting up with any other friends? 
A No. 
Q Did you expect to be meeting up with anybody else? 
A No. I didn't --it was just me and him that went there. There was two 
18 other people that I knew that we bumped into. But, other than that, there was nobody 
19 else that I've even found out afterwards was there. 
20 Q Okay. Were you in contact with those other two people as you were 
21 heading to the Capitol? 
22 A No. I think that we --no. They didn't go to the Capitol, to my knowledge. 
23 They came in an RV, and they were just kind of hanging out in the RV. 
24 
25 Q 
A Understood. 
But they might've went to the Capitol. I don't --I don't --they didn't go  1 with us, I don't believe. 
2 Q Fair enough. 
3 Just walk me through, sort of, what happened when you got to the Capitol 
4 grounds, what you're seeing, what's going on around you. 
5 A Just seeing a lot of people walking to the Capitol and walking up the steps. 
6 I mean, there wasn't --you know, nobody was being rowdy or --I guess maybe people 
7 were chanting all sorts of different stuff, but I don't --I don't remember. 
8 Q Do you remember hearing anybody in those chants encouraging people to 
9 go into the Capitol? 
10 
11 
12 A 
Q 
A Not to my recollection. 
Do you remember what the chants were about? 
No. It was all kind of garbly-garbled. I'm sure there was some things 
13 about --"Stop the steal," I remember people saying that, and I remember thinking that 
14 that was about as stupid as flat-Earthers. I think I made that comment. We were 
15 joking about flat-Earthers and people that thought that the election was stolen. 
So what were you feeling at this time, as you got close to the Capitol? 33 
16 
17 Q 
A I don't know. I was looking at the architecture and stuff. I thought it was 
18 pretty cool, kind of historic. 
19 Q Well, it's definitely a historic building, but there's --when you were 
20 there --by the time you're there, people had breached the Capitol, they were running up 
21 the steps. Did you notice any of the tear gas or anything coming from the other side? 
22 
23 of that. 
24 
25 A 
Q 
A No, no. That didn't happen on the east side where I was. There was none 
So what were you seeing? 
In fact, there was none of that --there was none of that that I saw.  34 
Q Okay. So did you see any barriers or anything --
A I actually saw police --yeah. I actually saw police moving barriers. 
Q Moving where? 
A Just pulling them away, pulling them out of the way. 
Q Did you see anyone else moving barriers? 1 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 A No. What I've learned after that is, it was almost like "A Tale of Two Cities." 
7 There was what happened on the west side, and what happened on the east side was 
8 exact opposites. 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 Q So how did you figure out how to get inside the Capitol? 
A We just walked up the steps. 
Q Just --did you think --
A There was people in the Capitol already. 
Q And did that make you think it was okay to be in the Capitol already? 
A At the time, I knew that --I knew that we probably shouldn't, but there was 
15 other people in there. Nobody was harming anything and --you know, in retrospect, it 
16 was a bad idea, obviously. But I don't think that I thought anything about it. It just 
17 didn't cross my mind. I was kind of following other people, I guess. 
18 Q Speaking of those other people, did you see people dressed in, like, tactical 
19 gear or, sort of, military gear? 
20 A I did when it was time to leave. At the beginning --well, I guess on the --if 
21 you were facing the Capitol, on the right side, I guess there's, like, an alcove or something 
22 with some pillars on the end. I think they had some tactical gear on. And there was, 
23 like, 8 or 10 of them. And maybe I saw some going across the lawn to the backside of 
24 the building. 
25 But inside the Capitol I didn't, until they came, I believe, from out of the bottom  35 
1 area. And then they blew the whistle, and we all knew it was time to go. 
2 Q So those sound like law enforcement. But did you see any, you know, 
3 civilians in tactical gear or other people trying to get inside the Capitol who were 
4 coordinating in tactical gear? 
5 A No, not that I remember. Like I said, after seeing stuff after that 
6 happened --you know, until they came in, there was none of that that was going on 
7 inside the Rotunda. I never got out of the Rotunda. You know, I was looking at the 
8 paintings. Obviously I was making stupid pictures and comments. But I was kind of 
9 just in awe. I was glad that people weren't, you know, tearing it up and spray-painting 
10 or trying to rip things up or --you know, people were being pretty peaceful, just kind of 
11 walking around, looking at stuff. 
12 And, you know, in retrospect, what happened on the other side, I mean, I couldn't 
13 have been involved in something like that. I think I would've been screaming at people 
14 to start acting like, you know, civilized people. 
15 Q While you're in the Rotunda, when you say "awe," do you mean awe at the 
16 building? 
17 A Yeah, the building, the pictures, the history. It's pretty cool. Y'all are kind 
18 of spoiled. That's some cool stuff y'all live around. 
19 
20 
21 Q Yeah. It is a lucky place to live sometimes. 
And were you in awe at the number of people who were in the Rotunda? 
A I was shocked, yeah. Well, not really shocked, but, yeah, I was --I wasn't in 
22 awe; I was kind of blown away. There was a lot of people in there. 
23 Q What did you think about those people? 
24 A I was proud of them for being peaceful and not doing anything stupid, you 
25 know? I mean, people weren't screaming and yelling or trying to spray-paint stuff or  1 trying to tear anything up. It was --people had --it kind of looked like a --I don't 
2 know --like, a frat party going through the Capitol. 
3 
4 Q Were there police officers in the Rotunda when you were there? 
A I don't know if they were police officers --well, yeah, I guess there was. 
5 mean, I don't know the difference between Capitol Police and regular police officers. 
6 But, yes, there was law enforcement there. I don't know if they had guns on, the ones 
7 by the door, but --
8 
9 
10 Q Well, regardless if --
A I'm sure they were Capitol Police of some kind. 
Q Regardless if they had guns, did you notice how people around you were 
11 interacting with the law enforcement? 36 
12 A What I saw, until they all came to get us out, there was nobody --they were 
13 just talking to them. There was nobody that I really saw until they came out from the 
14 bottom of the deal that was really yelling at them or anything like that. 
15 Q So describe to me what it sounds like in the Rotunda, because it's got pretty 
16 unique acoustics. So what were you hearing? 
17 A I don't know. It kind of sounded like a hum. You're right, it does have a 
18 weird sound going on in there. 
19 
20 
21 Q 
A 
Q Did you say a hum? 
Kind of a hum, yeah. 
But you didn't pick up on any shouting, anyone shouting in the police 
22 officers' faces, anything like that? 
23 A I did when they started to --when they started to come out of the bottom 
24 and run everybody off, I did hear some of that and see some of that. And I was pointing 
25 the other way, saying, "They're just doing their job. Get out of here. It's time to go."  37 
Q Okay. 1 
2 So I'm going to --you referenced some things you posted from inside the Rotunda. 
3 You recorded a selfie video, and in it, you said: "This is it, boys and girls. This is the 
4 Capitol. Apparently, there's some crazy shit going on in the Senate today and the 
5 certification. They've had enough. Well, uh, here we are." 
6 
7 So do you remember what you meant by posting that or saying that? 
A Well, yeah, I guess that I meant that the people had had enough, and they 
8 came through, into the Capitol, and they're showing their displeasure with what's going 
9 on in Congress. 
10 Q But you specifically mentioned the crazy shit going on in the Senate today 
11 and the certification. 
12 A Well, I found that out later on. Like I said earlier, I didn't really know that 
13 until I actually got there. And I honestly don't think that I knew that until after 
14 the --after the deal was over and I went to the hotel, I think that's when I figured or 
15 learned or remembered, or what, that they were actually certifying the election today. 
16 Q You say it in the Capitol. This was a video you recorded while in the 
17 Capitol. So you were aware while in the Rotunda that the certification was happening. 
18 How did you learn about that? 
19 
20 news --
21 
22 A As I just said, when we left the rally, we went to the hotel and watched the 
Q Oh, I'm sorry. 
A --and that's where I found out that it was breached. And that's when I 
23 think I realized that the certification was going on. 
24 Q I apologize. I misheard you. I thought you said after you left the Capitol. 
25 That's my fault. I apologize.  38 
1 Then, at the end of that video, you say, "I'm kind of proud of the people that stood 
2 up and said you know what? Enough." And you do mention that you were happy no 
3 one is vandalizing anything. And then you said, "I'm glad I came." 
4 
5 So was that how you felt at the moment? 
A At the moment, yeah, because I thought everything was going on was 
6 peaceful. 
7 
8 there? 
9 
10 
11 
12 Q 
A 
Q Even though you were aware that you probably shouldn't have been in 
Like I said, I was kind of following the group of people. 
Yeah. 
Did you intend to go anywhere else besides the Rotunda? 
A No. I mean, I just kind of walked around in circles and --you know, I think 
13 at some point, when the guys were coming up, there was a commotion. I might've 
14 walked over to --I don't remember where it was, but when I saw the police coming up, 
15 that's kind of when it was time to go. 
16 
17 Q 
A And did you drink a beer while in the Capitol? 
Well, no. It was a --I had a beer. It was empty when I got to the Capitol. 
18 I didn't want to get a public deal. 
19 I'm sure you saw the video where I do the, "I don't always storm the Capitol, but 
20 when I do, I prefer Coors Light." I don't know if you've ever seen those beer 
21 commercials, but that's kind of --that was a joke. There's beer commercials --you 
22 know, there's a beer commercial like that for Dos --I think it's Dos Equis. 
23 
24 
25 Q Understood. 
So what were you hoping to accomplish by entering the Capitol? 
A I had nothing to accomplish. I just walked in and looked around.  39 
1 Q But that would be something to accomplish. Basically, the question more 
2 directly is, why did you ultimately go into the Capitol? 
A I guess I saw everybody walking in and I wanted to follow. 
Q Okay. And then why did you eventually leave? 
A Because the police said it was time to go. 3 
4 
5 
6 Q And you didn't think before then --you mentioned that you were somewhat 
7 aware that you shouldn't be in the building. So --but no one had said "leave" before the 
8 time that you heard the police say "leave"? 
9 A No, I don't think, until the Capitol Police or law enforcement came up, I don't 
10 think I remember hearing anybody say to leave. I don't think. 
11 
12 Q Okay. 
You mentioned this video you recorded after, with your joke about the beer 
13 commercial. I think, in it, you say, "I don't always storm the Capitol." Why did you pick 
14 that phrase? 
15 
16 A 
Q Have you seen the Dos Equis commercial? 
I'll represent that I've seen the commercials, I know the commercial you're 
17 talking about. But I'm specifically focused on the three words "storm the Capitol." 
18 A Okay. You know how the guy on the commercial says, "I don't always climb 
19 Mount Everest, but when I do, I prefer Dos Equis"? 
20 
21 Q Yeah. 
A That's kind of --that's kind of why I said that. I was making a parody. 
22 was trying to be --a joke. 
23 Q I understand the joke, the parody of it. I'm asking about your choice of 
24 words, though. Why did you say "storm the Capitol"? Why did you use those three 
25 words?  1 A Because I was trying to intimidate [sic] the guy on the commercial and, you 
2 know, use those kind of phrases that he uses in his commercial. 
3 
4 Q 
A Have you ever --
And, actually, there's three or four takes of that commercial. I think y'all 40 
5 only showed one of them. But I didn't like the takes, so I did it, like, three or four times. 
6 Q Have you ever seen one of those Dos Equis commercials where the guy says 
7 anything about storming the Capitol? 
8 
9 
10 
11 A 
Q 
A I don't think he did do one of those. Did he? 
I don't know. I'm asking you. 
No, I don't --I don't remember seeing one. 
Q Okay. So I'm really just asking then, not --I understand the parody. 
12 understand why you did the, "I don't always storm the Capitol, but when I do, I prefer 
13 Coors Light." I get the joke of it. 
14 But I'm asking you why you picked the words "storm the Capitol" instead of "I 
15 don't always walk into the Capitol" or "I don't always come to D.C." or "I don't always do 
16 X, V, or Z." Why "storm the Capitol"? 
17 A Because I was trying to emulate the kind of thing that he would've done in a 
18 commercial. 
19 Q But you just told me that he never would've said "storm the Capitol," so I'm 
20 asking you, why "storm the Capitol"? 
21 A I guess you would have to understand the jokingness and the angle of those 
22 commercials to really get that. I don't know why I brought up "storm." I just --I did. 
23 It seemed like something that somebody would say in a situation like that. 
24 But I didn't actually storm the Capitol. You know, I kind of walked in and walked 
25 out. So if you're trying to imply that I stormed the Capitol, I don't think that would be  41 
1 honest, and I think you're trying to make it something that it wasn't. I was being a smart 
2 aleck and --
3 
4 
5 Q 
A 
Q I'm not trying to --
--making a funny commercial. 
I'm not trying to imply anything. I'm trying to figure out why you used 
6 those specific three words. So let me ask --
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
15 "storm"? 
16 A Well, I believe I've answered that question. 
--did you hear anybody around you saying "storm the Capitol"? 
I do not believe I did hear anybody say that. 
Do you remember reading it on social media ever? 
Not before I made that commercial. 
Do you remember anybody chanting it on January 6th? 
I can't --I do not remember, but it's possible, but I don't think so. 
Do you think that you saw anything on January 6th that led you to use 
No, because if --I'm sure you're familiar with what went on on both sides of 
17 the Capitol, and I think we would have to agree that nobody on the east side really 
18 stormed the Capitol. I think that they walked in. Where, on the west side, I would say 
19 that that might've been "storming" when they used a two-by-four and a police barricade 
20 to break in a window. 
21 I think that the people on the one side, you know --I find it abhorrent, what they 
22 did over there, and I don't agree with it. And it makes me angry that they did it, because 
23 I think that the people on the other side were very peaceful. And, you know, we all 
24 should've just sat down or whatever. 
25 But I think that the people on the one side were doing some pretty bad things,  42 
1 and I think the people on the other side weren't really causing any harm. I don't 
2 remember anybody, you know, destroying anything or really doing anything but walking 
3 around taking pictures. 
4 And then, when it was time to go, everybody turned around --I'm sure --I saw 
5 some people fighting with officers for a bit, but then everybody turned around and left. 
6 Q Okay. So do you think that what happened on the west side, what you just 
7 described as what could be a storm, impacted your decision to use those words? 
8 
9 
10 A I didn't know that that happened until afterwards. 
Q Okay. 
After January 6th, you post that "the Capitol was not stormed, the people walked 
11 in." So I take it --
12 
13 
14 did? 
15 
16 
17 A Yeah. 
Q --based on your answer, then, is that what --you were describing what you 
A Yes. 
Q At that time --do you remember that post? 
A No. And I've since been taken off of Facebook, because I was wanting to go 
18 back and look through some of that stuff to see what I said, because I know --I know all 
19 the negative stuff that I said. I know that I said a lot of positive things about the police 
20 officers and other things that went on as well. 
21 Q Okay. But do you think at that time that you posted you knew about the 
22 west side, what had been happening that you just described as being a storming of the 
23 Capitol? 
24 A What do you --previously? On the day of? Or when are you talking 
25 about?  43 
1 Q I'll rephrase. When you made this post, which seems to be after 
2 January 6th, when you say that "the Capitol was not stormed, the people walked in," you 
3 answered that you were describing what you did. Were you aware at that time what 
4 had happened on the west side? 
5 A What's the date of that post? 
6 
7 
8 
9 Q 
A 
Q 
A Unfortunately, I don't know. 
Then I can't answer that question. 
Fair enough. 
I would say that if it was after January 6th that I probably knew about the 
10 bad stuff that happened on the other side. I think that would be a safe assumption. 
11 Q Okay. 
12 And, at that time, did you think what happened about the bad stuff could be 
13 described as "storming the Capitol"? 
14 
15 
16 A 
Q 
A I think that would be a very fair assumption. 
Okay. 
I wasn't on that side, so I can't really speak to anything other than what I 
17 saw. And what I saw, I did not appreciate or like at all. 
18 
19 Q I understand. 
Mr. - So, at this point, this might be an easier question for you, Ms. 
20 Wagner. Can you just describe the current status of Mr. Conover's case? 
21 Ms. Wagner. Yes, of course. At the moment, we're waiting for probation office 
22 to finalize the PSR report. We should have that within the next few weeks. The 
23 prosecutor will have his sentencing memorandum due at least 2 weeks before the 
24 sentencing. Mine will be due a week after his. And then we will be doing the sentence 
25 remotely.  1 
2 
3 Mr- Great. Thank you. 
BYMR.-
Q So we only have a few more questions that we'll go through before --and 
4 you've already described some of them, but we want to get a sense of how you've been 
5 feeling about January 6th since then. 44 
6 But one thing I do want to read is another post that you made. And I represent 
7 to you this is after January 6th. 
8 "Let me explain something to your dumb ass the people didn't go to the Capitol to 
9 overturn an election they went there to let Congress know we are tired of there shit and 
10 to overturn them." 
11 
12 
13 A 
Q 
A 
14 handful. Yep. 
What do you mean by "overturn them"? 
Vote them out of office, Republican and Democrat alike, except for a 
15 I like some of the --I like some of the Democrats. I've actually voted Democrat 
16 before. I don't know if you guys --you might be too young to remember Ann Richards, 
17 but she was our Governor in Texas. I loved that lady. I've voted for Democrat judges 
18 in Fort Worth, because I think Republican judges are a little too heavy on the jail 
19 sentences for people. 
20 Q Understood. 
21 So do you still believe that marching to and entering the Capitol was an effective 
22 way to express yourself about your feelings about Congress on January 6th? 
23 A I think that if we --if everybody would've just been peaceful like they were in 
24 the Rotunda, yes, I think that things would be different. But I could be wrong. 
25 Q Things that --I'm sorry. So you do think it is an appropriate and effective  45 
1 use of your political voice on January 6th to have gone into the Capitol? 
2 A In retrospect, probably no. Well, definitely no, because of what happened. 
3 So you're comparing apples to oranges, and I can't do that. So, based on what 
4 happened, no, I don't think that was an appropriate way that we should've behaved 
5 ourselves at all. 
6 Q Understood. 
7 So, just generally, have your feelings about Congress changed since last 
8 January 6th? 
9 A Well, since the war in Ukraine, they seem like they're trying to get on the 
10 same page as each other, so maybe a little bit. 
11 But, no, I think that --I think that a lot of those people have been there long 
12 enough. And I hear them arguing with themselves that, you know, we're going to fix 
13 this, y'all don't know how to fix it. But the people that are saying "we know how to fix 
14 this" have been in Congress for 40 years, and if they haven't fixed it in 40 years, so why 
15 should the American people believe that they're going to fix it in the next 5 --or 4? 
16 
17 Q Yeah. 
And just a few more. This is a pretty open-ended question, but do you think 
18 there's anything that could've been done differently to prevent a situation like 
19 January 6th from happening again? 
20 
21 A I'd have probably locked the Capitol doors and shut them. 
Q So we've covered a lot of topics today. Anything that we missed that you 
22 think is important for us to hear or to know? 
23 
24 
25 A I don't believe so. 
Q Okay. Thank you. 
Mr.- , do you have anything?  Mr- I don't have anything. Thank you. 
Mr.- All right. 46 
1 
2 
3 Well, before we close, we would like to thank you for taking the time to speak to 
4 us. You know, we're trying to get all of the perspectives about January 6th, and it can be 
5 a little difficult to find people like yourself who are willing to talk to us. So we really do 
6 appreciate your willingness to do so and for taking the time to listen to my questions and 
7 to answer them to the best of your ability. 
8 And thank you, Ms. Wagner, for working with us on this. 
9 
10 So I think we will adjourn the record at 4:36 p.m. Thank you. 
Mr. Conover. Okay. And I want to also --I do want to say, if I was terse with 
11 you guys, I apologize. I didn't mean to be so. 
12 Mr.. It happens. And I don't think you were too terse, so thank you. 
13 But we appreciate it. If we were sounding terse, it's the same thing. We're just trying 
14 to --
15 Mr. Conover. Well, we're just --we're just doing our job --we're just doing 
16 what --you know, I get it, guys, and I have no ill will. Thank you. 
17 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
23 Mr. Okay. Thank you very much. 
Ms. Wagner. Thank you all. 
Mr.- Take care. Have a great rest of your day. 
Ms. Wagner. You too. 
Mr. Conover. You too. 
Mr.- Bye-bye.
