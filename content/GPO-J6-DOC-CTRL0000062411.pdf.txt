Written Testimony of 
Heidi L. Beirich, Ph.D. 
Co-Founder// Executive Vice President 
Global Project Against Hate and Extremism 
Before the 
Congress of the United States 
Select Committee to Investigate the 
January 6th 
Attack on the United States Capitol 
Regarding 
"The Role of the Proud Boys in the January 6th Capitol Attack and Beyond" 
March 22, 2022 
Chairman Bennie Thompson and esteemed members of the select committee, thank you for the 
opportunity to submit written testimony on the white supremacist Proud Boys and their role 
before, during, and after the January 6 insurrection. My name is Heidi Beirich. I hold a Ph.D. in 
political science from Purdue University and am the co-founder of the Global Project Against 
Hate and Extremism (GPAHE). I am an expert on white supremacist and far-right extremist 
movements, serving as an advisory board member of the International Network for Hate Studies, 
a co-founder and co-chair of the Change the Terms Coalition, which advocates for solutions to 
online extremism, and the author of numerous studies on extremism as well as co-editor of Neo­
Confederacy: A Critical Introduction. My organization is a member of the Christchurch Call 
Advisory Network, an international body created by the governments of France and New 
Zealand after the 2019 Christchurch mosque attacks, which the U.S. joined last year, that advises 
on the handling of online terrorist content and activity and is also a member of President Biden's 
Summit for Democracy Year of Action. My research has been cited in hundreds of academic 
pieces and news reports, including dozens of analyses of the Proud Boys. I am honored by your 
request for testimony on this group. 
My expertise on the Proud Boys reaches back to the group's founding in 2016, when I was 
serving as the director of the Southern Poverty Law Center's (SPLC) Intelligence Project. We 
had immediate concerns about the ideology and potentially violent nature of the organization. 
My team and I closely monitored the Proud Boys and issued several reports about their hateful 
views and activities. Our concerns about violence were validated by a series of incidents, such as 
a 2018 street battle against protesters in Manhattan, for which ten Proud Boys members were 
charged with assault. Due to the group's widely documented racist and bigoted nature, it was 
added to the SPLC's 2017 hate group list. The SPLC defines a hate group as "an organization or 
collection of individuals that -based on its official statements or principles, the statements of its 
leaders, or its activities -has beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, 
1  typically for their immutable characteristics." The organizations on the list "vilify others because 
of their race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender identity -prejudices that strike at 
the heart of our democratic values and fracture society along its most fragile fault lines."1 The 
Proud Boys remain on the list to this day.2 
Since co-founding GPAHE in 2020, I have continued to monitor the organization and its 
activities. I also served as an expert witness in a civil suit against the Proud Boys, Metropolitan 
African Methodist Episcopal Church vs. Proud Boys International, L.L.C.; Enrique Tarrio, John 
Does #sl-8.3 My testimony here will focus on four topics: the ideological belief system of the 
Proud Boys, and the role racism, other forms of bigotry, and white supremacy play in their 
views; how the organization's activities prior to the January 6th attack laid the groundwork for 
their involvement in the insurrection; the group's role in the events of January 6, 2021; and 
finally the impact of the events of January 6 on the organization. 
Proud Boys Organization Promotes White Supremacist Beliefs 
The Proud Boys are an organization that espouses racist, misogynistic, Islamophobic, anti­
LGBTQ, and anti-immigrant beliefs. Members, including each of the group's three leaders-­
Gavin Mclnnes, Jason Van Dyke and Enrique Tarrio--have promoted white supremacy and 
worked hand-in-hand with other white supremacist groups.4 When Gavin Mclnnes founded the 
group in 2016, he referred to it as a "pro-Western fraternity." In an Op-Ed for Taki's Magazine, 
Mclnnes announced the Proud Boys' formation and described its members as "Western 
chauvinists who refuse to apologize for creating the modem world" and who "long for the days 
when 'girls were girls and men were men.' "5 The term "Western chauvinism" is thinly veiled 
code for white supremacy and patriarchal misogyny. The term is employed to make the Proud 
Boys' motives appear more palatable to mainstream audiences and to deflect charges of racism. 
The choice of Taki 's Magazine as a launch for the group is noteworthy. The outlet has published 
many white supremacists including Richard Spencer,6 a leader in the August 2017 
Charlottesville, Va., racist riots; Peter Brimelow, who has long argued immigrants are destroying 
America's white culture;7 and Jared Taylor,8 who argues that Black and Brown people are 
inherently more violent than white people, and whose ideas inspired Dylann Roof, who killed 
nine people during a Bible study at Mother Emmanuel Church in Charleston, S.C. in 2015.9 The 
Op-Ed described the Proud Boys' second meeting in New York City, which featured drinking 
and fighting as well as reading excerpts of Pat Buchanan's book, Death of the West: How Dying 
Populations and Immigrant Invasions Imperil Our Culture and Civilization.10 Buchanan's book

2  explicitly endorses white supremacist ideas about the United States and claims that non-white 
immigrants are destroying the country_ I I Buchanan argues that America, the "greatest 
civilization in history," is heading towards becoming a "Third World" nation by 2050, 
approximately when the white population is slated by the Census Bureau to fall below 50 percent 
due primarily to non-white immigration. The original working title for Buchanan's book was The 
Death of Whitey, which the publisher rejected. I2 
The Proud Boys creed, "The West is the Best," is deeply telling of their bias against non-white 
ethnicities and non-Christian religions. At times, the Proud Boys use this coded language, like 
substituting "the West" or "Western civilization" for the racial category of whiteness, to give a 
wink and nod to white supremacy while trying to maintain plausible deniability that they are not 
racist. 13 But this is a fa9ade belied by an extensive track record of racist and bigoted comments 
by members as well as their extensive links to other white supremacist groups. 
The bigotry of the organization is evident in its rites of membership. To join the Proud Boys, all 
prospective members must submit a video stating, "I'm a proud Western Chauvinist; I refuse to 
apologize for creating the modem world." This is very close in wording and theme to the "14 
Words," a popular white supremacist slogan, which reads: "We must secure the existence of our 
people and a future for our white children." The slogan was coined by David Lane, a member of 
the domestic terrorist group The Order, which engaged in several acts of violence in the 1980s 
including the assassination of Jewish Denver radio talk show host Alan Berg. It is the most 
widespread slogan in the white supremacist and neo-Nazi world, both in the U.S. and abroad. 
Recent white supremacist mass murderers, including Dylann Roof and the Pittsburgh Tree of 
Life synagogue shooter, Jason Bowers, have used its shorthand, just the number 14, in their 
writings. Often white supremacists post "1488," which combines the 14 words with a reference 
to "Heil Hitler," because "H" is the eighth letter in the alphabet. Both slogans emphasize the 
need to secure or preserve Western civilization, which in the view of the speakers means the 
dominance of whites, and Mclnnes is aware of this fact. In an episode of Mclnnes' video show 
that featured white nationalist Emily Y oucis, she asked him to say the 14 Words. Mclnnes 
mostly complied, replacing "white" with "Westem."I4 Overall, the Proud Boys' slogan about 
Western chauvinists creating the modem world cannot be disentangled from the idea that 
Western is a code word for "white people."I5 
Leaders and Members Unapologetically Hateful 
Each of the three leaders of the Proud Boys has a demonstrated record of bigotry. Mclnnes has a 
long history of publicly making racist, antisemitic, misogynistic, and other bigoted comments. 
His often equates whiteness with a superior culture, a fundamental tenet of white supremacy. In 
2002, he said "We seem really racist and homophobic because we hang around with fl'gs and

3  n ****rs so much. It just becomes part of our vernacular." 16 That same year, when he was asked 
by a reporter what he thought about his neighbors in New York City's Williamsburg 
neighborhood, Mclnnes said, "Well, at least they're not n****rs or Puerto Ricans. At least 
they're white."17 In 2003, he said, "I love being white and I think it's something to be very proud 
of. I don't want our culture diluted. We need to close the borders now and let everyone 
assimilate to a Western, white, English-speaking way oflife."18 
There is substantial additional evidence of Mclnnes' racism. In 2016, Mclnnes called Jada 
Pinkett Smith, who is Black, a "monkey actress."19 He has also said that it is fair to describe him 
as an "Islamophobe."20 On a November 2016 episode of "The Gavin Mclnnes Show," he 
repeatedly yelled "Heil Hitler" and gave the Nazi salute.21 In March 2017, Mclnnes was accused 
of antisemitism for posting a video on the far-right, anti-Muslim Rebel Media platform called 
"Ten Things I Hate about Jews," which was later retitled "Ten Things I Hate About Israel."22 
Mclnnes would later tweet, "10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT THE GODDAMN 
MOTHERFUCKING JEWS!" He has also justified discrimination against Jews, saying that 
historically, perhaps Jews "were ostracized for a good reason."23 On January 17, 2018, Mclnnes 
referred to Senator Cory Booker as a "Sambo" on his podcast. 24 On his Conservative Review 
Television (CRTV) show on April 24, 2018, Mclnnes said, "Muslims have a problem with 
inbreeding. They tend to marry their first cousins ... When you have mentally damaged inbreds ... 
and you have a hate book called the Koran ... you end up with a perfect recipe for mass murder."25 
In an undated YouTube video from "The Gavin Mclnnes Show," which ran from 2015-2017, in 
which he interviewed right-wing author Ann Coulter, Mclnnes told Coulter that the 
economically successful countries she was discussing, in terms of their cultural and religious 
aspects, were "just a fancy way of saying white."26 She disagreed. 
Mclnnes has also endorsed the racist "Great Replacement" conspiracy theory, which argues that 
white populations are being purposely displaced by people of color, particularly immigrants, in 
Western countries. Jews are often blamed for this "plot." On June 26, 2017, he posted to Twitter 
an endorsement of this idea. Mclnnes' tweet read, "This attitude+ immigration= white genocide 
in the West (South Africa's version is much more intense)."27 The attitude Mclnnes was 
referring to was an allegation by the conspiratorial website Info Wars that white women were 
encouraged by feminists to abort babies, thus shrinking the white population. 28

4  Mclnnes is also unapologetically misogynistic. He has written extensively on how women want 
to be "downright abused" and that he had to stop "playing nice" and begin "totally defiling the 
women I slept with" to get more women to have sex with him.29 On June 28, 2017, on "The 
Gavin Mclnnes Show," he called women "dumb" and said they do not excel in areas "like 
writing."30 
The individual who briefly replaced Mclnnes as leader in November 2018, Texas lawyer Jason 
Van Dyke, exposed similarly racist views. Van Dyke was a member of the Proud Boys' Dallas­
Fort Worth chapter who had previously served as the group's attorney. Van Dyke has a long 
history of involvement in hate groups, 31 and he is deeply racist. In 2014, Van Dyke tweeted a 
photo of a noose at a Black man and wrote, "Look good and hard at this picture you fucking 
n***er. It's where I am going to put your neck."32 In 2018, after his personal cell phone number 
was posted on Twitter and a number of anonymous users sent him mocking text messages, Van 
Dyke responded to many of the messages with photos of guns. He texted "fuck off f***ot" to 
one person and "fuck off dumb n****rs" to another.33 Van Dyke was removed as leader of the 
Proud Boys after he released the Proud Boys' bylaws and revealed the names of the group's 
elders, but has continued to associate with members.34 For example, Oak Point, Texas, police 
allege in criminal case reports that Van Dyke worked with the Arizona chapter of the Proud Boys 
to conduct surveillance on a Phoenix man as part of a plot to either injure or murder him in late 
2018.35 
Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio, who was appointed in November 2018 and served as the 
Florida state director of Latinos for Trump in 2020, has his own history of racist and bigoted 
comments. (Tarrio began his association with the group in 2017, one year after the Proud Boys 
was founded, and in June 2021, indicated he may step down soon).36 In one of Tarrio's first posts 
on the unregulated social media site, Minds, he wrote, "This [website] needs to get filled up with 
Proud Boys, not no f***ot ass photogs!" He followed the post with, "Bitch n***er f***ot tranny. 
Stress test 3." Tarrio has called Islam a "shitstain religion. ,m On his personal social media 
accounts, Tarrio denigrates transgender people and said the comic and actor Leslie Jones looked 
like a gorilla.38 In 2018, his Twitter profile was suspended.39 On his Telegram channel, Enrique's 
House of Propaganda, he has posted many bigoted items. On November 25, 2020, one post read,

5  "N***as that smoke hookah suck dick." In a November 2020 interview, Tarrio admitted that the 
Proud Boys attracted members who had white supremacist views. 40 
Other prominent members of the group have also publicly posted their racist, misogynist, and 
homophobic beliefs. For example, Joseph Randall "Joe" Biggs, a Proud Boys organizer from 
Florida who has been indicted for conspiracy for his role in the January 6 Capitol attack,41 wrote 
"Make Zimbabwe Rhodesia again" -a call that is commonly made by white nationalists for the 
return of a white colonialist government in the African nation. 42 According to Media Matters, 
Biggs "has repeatedly tweeted his approval of date rape and sexual violence."43 His tweets 
include, "I like to reason with her (reason=chloroform) and then just drink a lot of beer and 
release" and "Every girl at this bar wants to fuck me. They don't know it yet because the drugs 
haven't kicked in." Biggs has also written incendiary anti-LGBTQ tweets. He told his followers, 
"tranny's eat kittens, and that's just not cool man. Punch a tranny save a pussy" and attacked 
those who disagree with him by calling them "f*gs."44 
Leaders of the Proud Boys repeatedly have made light of hateful beliefs spread or shared by 
members or tried to brush off such comments as pushing boundaries or as forms of humor. 
Asked about the private posts glorifying hatred against women and Jewish people that other 
Proud Boys made on the social media site Minds, Tarrio admitted they were offensive. But he 
downplayed the situation by arguing that members of the group were simply seeing what they 
could get away with after many of their accounts were banned from mainstream social media 
platforms in October 2018. Tarrio told a reporter that hateful posts were not a reflection of posts 
in private groups, which he declined to reveal, describing them as mainly about beer and 
"trannies. "45 
There is ample, additional evidence of white supremacist beliefs among the ranks of the Proud 
Boys. Members often use signs and slogans associated with white supremacy. For example, the 
Proud Boys, including its leaders,46 often flash the "OK" hand symbol, which has ties to white 
supremacist ideology. 47 The symbol's adoption in this way was best exemplified in March 2019 
when Brenton Tarrant, the white supremacist who plead guilty to murdering 51 people in back­
to-back mass shootings at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, smiled and flashed the 
sign to reporters at a court hearing on his case. 48

6  The number of racist, antisemitic, or otherwise bigoted comments and posts made by Proud Boys 
is extensive. Here are just a few examples. In a Proud Boys private Minds group, a post by Proud 
Boy Adam Richard read, "Zuckerberg is a N***er-f'l<**er!" The next day, another member, 
"Joey the Rhodie" posted a photo of a Hasidic Jewish man dancing captioned, "When the UN 
adds another million to the Holocaust death toll." On November 2, 2018, "KaiserW" shared a 
photo of Elliot Rodger, a violent misogynist who shot six people in Isla Vista, Calif., in a 2014 
rampage. The post was captioned, "Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing 
everything."49 In addition, the Proud Boys' Telegram channels are filled with racist and bigoted 
material. Dozens and dozens of posts share hate content from white supremacist websites such as 
V dare.com. Posts regularly express the racist "Great Replacement" conspiracy theory. A 
September 7, 2020, post read: "The true minority in this world ARE whites. White children are 
less than 3% of the worlds [sic] population. I think since white majority countries are on a 
pathway to extinction we should correctly refer to non whites by their true names. Worldwide 
majority."50 
Additional evidence of the white supremacist nature of the Proud Boys comes from members and 
leaders' willingness to work in concert with other white supremacists. The Proud Boys 
participated in the 2017 protests at the University of California, Berkeley, alongside a variety of 
white supremacist groups, including the neo-Nazi Rise Above Movement (RAM), the white 
supremacist Identity Evropa (IE), and the neo-Nazi Traditionalist Worker Party (TWP). 
Similarly, members ofldentity Evropa and TWP have joined with the Proud Boys at a series of 
protests in Portland, Ore. Members also attended the violent "Unite the Right" white supremacist 
rally in Charlottesville, Va. in August 2017, which ended in the murder of antiracist activist 
Heather Heyer by a white supremacist. The event was organized by Jason Kessler, a Proud Boy 
at the time, who invited numerous white supremacist groups to participate.51 White supremacist 
leaders including Richard Spencer, David Duke (former head of a Ku Klux Klan group) and 
others participated. White supremacist groups including the League of the South, Identity 
Evropa, and the Traditionalist Workers Party were also on hand. Alex Michael Ramos, one of the 
men convicted of assaulting a Black man with metal pipes in a parking garage during the 
protests, claimed he joined the Proud Boys after Charlottesville. 52 Enrique Tarrio was among the 
participants in Charlottesville, serving as part of the militia security for the rally. 53 
Glorification of Violence Central to Beliefs 
Many of the events Proud Boys have participated in have ultimately led to violence. This is not 
surprising as the glorification of violence is core to the group's beliefs. The Proud Boys have a 
clear history of inciting, supporting, and praising violence under the guise of self-defense, saying 
"responding to small slights with brutal force is key to the Proud Boys' strategy."54 The group's

7  members often declare, "We don't start fights, we finish them."55 Another common slogan is 
"F AFO," meaning "fuck around and find out."56 
Proud Boys' violence has parallels to dangerous historical periods as was recently described in a 
report by the International Centre for Counter-Terrorism, which compared the Proud Boys to 
fascist groups from the 1930s, in particular Nazi leader Adolf Hitler's Sturmabteilung (SA), 
better known as the Stormtroopers. The SA "provided protection for Nazi rallies and assemblies, 
disrupted the meetings of opposing parties, [fought] against the paramilitary units of the 
opposing parties, and intimidated marginalized communities. "57 Incidents attributed to the Proud 
Boys show that the group has mirrored the SA by providing protection to far-right speakers and 
provocateurs; disrupting events by democratic socialists on campuses and women's marches, 
among other entities they oppose; and by intimidating marginalized communities through 
rallying, stalking, violence, and other harassment campaigns. During the 2018 sentencing of two 
Proud Boys found guilty of gang assault, assault, and riot charges, New York Supreme Court 
Justice Mark Dwyer said, "I know enough about history to know what happened in Europe in the 
Thirties. We don't want that to happen in New York, especially at this time in the country when 
people are so divided."58 A constitutional law professor made this same comparison while 
recounting his experience during the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry lockdown, which 
happened due to a Proud Boys rally. He recalled the comments of his friend, Justice Hans Linde, 
who escaped Nazi Germany and relocated with his family to Portland. Linde once confided in 
him that, "His first clear memory was of watching from the family apartment while Nazis in 
brown shirts brawled with communists on the [Berlin thoroughfare] Kurfiirstendamm below."59 
Mclnnes has also regularly endorsed the use of violence. In a June 2016 episode of "The Gavin 
Mclnnes Show," he said, "We will kill you. That's the Proud Boys in a nutshell. We will kill 
you. We look nice, we seem soft, we have boys in our name ... we will assassinate you."60 In 
2017, he said in an interview that violence "is a really effective way to solve problems."61 
Mclnnes declared in 2018: "I want violence, I want punching in the face. I'm disappointed in 
Trump supporters for not punching enough. "62 
One of the group's hazing rituals, required to move up in the organization to the third degree, 
includes calling out the names of cereal brands while being punched in the face. 63 Being

8  within the group, one suggested task is to physically assault an antifascist activist. 64 Tarrio 
completed the fourth stage for becoming a Proud Boy by punching someone he believed to be an 
antifascist activist in June 2018.65 
Joe Biggs, one of the men charged with conspiracy during the Capitol insurrection, joined the 
Proud Boys in 2018 and became an organizer for the group. Biggs has compared planning for 
Proud Boys events to "planning to go into a combat zone. "66 He has often demonstrated support 
for violence. For example, Biggs recorded a video of himself holding an American-flag-themed 
bat with spikes on the end, saying he was preparing to "bust some heads." He also wore a T-shirt 
with the phrase "Training to Throw Communists Out of Helicopters" emblazoned on the front67 
(This refers to the practice of Chilean death squads under the government of former President 
Pinochet who killed political opponents by throwing them out of helicopters). In January 2019, 
Proud Boy Reggie Axtell threatened Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler, saying that his days are 
"fucking numbered." "I promise you this, Ted Wheeler: I'm coming for you, you little punk. 
And all your little antifa bastards. "68 On a December 2020 episode of War Boys, a livestreamed 
Proud Boys show which aired after the election, Biggs described government officials as "evil 
scum" who "deserved to die a traitor's death." Ethan Nordean, a Proud Boys Elder also charged 
with conspiracy for January 6, replied, "Yup, Day of the Rope."69 The phrase "Day of the Rope" 
refers to a scene in The Turner Diaries, one of the most influential texts among far-right 
extremist and white supremacist communities, where white supremacist rebels carry out mass 
lynchings of those they perceive to have betrayed the white race. 70 
Connections to Allies of Former President Donald Trump 
The Trump advisor with the closest ties to the Proud Boys is Roger Stone, who lives in South 
Florida as does Tarrio. The earliest evidence of their relationship came from Face book, 
according to the Washington Post. A network of fake accounts and pages shared information 
about politics and about Stone during a period ranging from 2015 to 2017. When Facebook 
shuttered the network in 2020, it wrote that it "first started looking into this network as part of 
our investigation into the Proud Boys' attempts to return to Facebook after we had designated 
and banned them from the platform" in 2018. " ... Our investigation linked this network to Roger

9  Stone and his associates."71 This network of more than a hundred Facebook and Instagram 
accounts spent over $300,000 on ads to promote their posts and included false personas.72 
In May 2017, Stone posted a video on Facebook showing him undergoing a "low-level 
initiation" into the group.73 As part of the initiation, Stone says, "Hi, I'm Roger Stone. I'm a 
Western chauvinist. I refuse to apologize for creating the modem world," making him a "first­
degree" member. Stone denies being a member of the group. In March 2018, ahead of an 
appearance at the annual Republican Dorchester Conference in Salem, Oregon, Stone sought out 
the Proud Boys to act as his "security" for the event; photos posted online showed Stone drinking 
with several Proud Boys.74 Repeatedly in 2019, Stone posted photos of himself with Proud Boys, 
in May (alongside Fox News host Tucker Carlson) and July. In December, the Proud Boys 
posted a video on their website, showing Stone with Tarrio.75 
In late January 2019, when Stone was indicted on seven criminal counts in connection with the 
Mueller investigation into Trump's links to Russia (Trump would later pardon Stone), Tarrio met 
Stone leaving a Florida courthouse. Wearing a "Roger Stone Did Nothing Wrong" T-shirt sold 
by his own company, Tarrio said that the indictment was nothing but "trumped-up charges" and 
was later seen visiting Stone's house. In Washington, D.C. the following day, a small number of 
Proud Boys demonstrated outside the courthouse where Stone pleaded not guilty to the charges, 
carrying "Roger Stone did nothing wrong" signs. The Proud Boys got into an argument with 
anti-Stone hecklers.76 When Stone posted an image on social media interpreted as a threat 
against the judge overseeing his case, he was forced to disclose where he had gotten the image. 
Stone said he had been sent photos by a several people including Tarrio and Proud Boys member 
Tyler Ziolkowski. 77 
Even though Stone told a reporter in September 2020 that he had no connection to the Proud 
Boys, The Washington Post revealed that on November 5, 2020, after Stone told an aide to 
resurrect his "Stop the Steal" campaign, he directed aides to monitor a group chat on Signal titled 
"F.O.S.," apparently meaning "Friends of Stone," which included Tarrio.78 By December 2020, 
they were openly working together on Stone's "Stop the Steal" efforts to discredit the 
presidential election. On December 11, Stone joined Tarrio and another Proud Boys leader at a 
D.C. rally centered on claims that the election had been stolen. The next morning, before another 
pro-Trump rally in the city, Tarrio and others were given a tour of the White House.79

10  The connections between Stone and the Proud Boys were made more explicit in a February 2022 
ruling by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta that allowed lawsuits against Trump related to January 
6 to move forward.80 "Stone's connections to both the President and these groups [Proud Boys 
and Oath Keepers] in the days leading up to January 6th is a well pleaded fact," Mehta wrote. 
"Discovery might prove that connection to be an important one." That assessment was the result 
ofMehta's determination that Trump and the extremist groups were conceivably working in 
concert as part of a "civil conspiracy." 
There are other connections between the Proud Boys and the Trump orbit. For example, Tarrio 
was filmed behind Trump in February 2019, during a televised speech in Miami wearing a pro­
Stone T-shirt.81 In 2020, Tarrio served as a state leader of Latinos for Trump.82 In an October 
2020 interview, Tarrio said that he had "personally knocked on 40,000 doors for the President." 
These comments came after Trump said in the September 29 presidential debate that the Proud 
Boys should "stand back and stand by," which Tarrio described as a directive "to stand by 
him. "83 Members of the Proud Boys were also involved in sending out links to poll watching 
sign-up sites and bolstering support for Trump at the polls. 84 
Proud Boys have also been active in other GOP political circles in Florida. Proud Boys members 
have been featured in photos with high profile members of Florida's Republican party, including 
Senator Rick Scott, and U.S. Representatives Mario Diaz-Balart and Matt Gaetz.85 In August 
2020, Proud Boy members were seen alongside Laura Loomer, a Florida congressional 
candidate, and Stone at a party celebrating Loomer's primary victory (she lost in the general 
election). Loomer herself is a far-right figure who has been banned from social media sites for 
anti-Muslim hate speech.86 
Proud Boys Violence Increases in 2020 
The Proud Boys have a history of involvement in violence that reaches back nearly to their 
founding. Generally, this violence has involved members of the Proud Boys confronting 
antifascist protesters and protests, though at times the protests were staged by the group itself. 
For example, Kyle Chapman, who founded the Proud Boys affiliated Fraternal Order of Alt­
Knights, rose to fame on the far right after a video of him breaking a wooden stick over the head 
of an antifascist protester at a March 2017 "March 4 Trump" rally in Berkeley, Calif., went 
viral.87 In September 2017, the far-right group Patriot Prayer, with Proud Boys members

11  participating, and the local anti-hate coalition "Portland Stands United Against Hate" held 
competing rallies on the same day in Portland. Several fights broke out and three people were 
arrested, one for speeding towards counterprotesters in a car. At other times, Proud Boys have 
been directly involved in major white supremacist events, including some members participating 
in the August 2017 Charlottesville, Virginia, white riots. And at other times, members have 
directly targeted those they opposed. On June 3, 2018, Donovan Flippo, a Proud Boy, and Allen 
Puckett of the rabidly anti-LGBTQ group, Hells Shaking Street Preachers, were filmed attacking 
a man outside of a parking garage.88 In September 2018, Proud Boy Tusitala "Tiny" Toese tried 
to attack two Black men after a rally in Austin. Apparently angered by their Obama hats, Toese 
flew into a rage and shouted, "You won't survive in my world, boy" and "I'll blow through your 
fucking window!" while the men hid inside of a store. Police had to intervene. 89 
2020 saw changes in the nature of the Proud Boys' street activity, including an increase in 
involvement countering the racial justice protests that began after the murder of George Floyd in 
May 2020. According to the Armed Conflict and Location and Event Data Project (ACLED), the 
percentage of events with counterdemonstrators in which Proud Boys members participated was 
more than 10 times the rate at which others engaged with counterdemonstrators. After the racial 
justice protests and anti-lockdown protests began, in the second and third quarters of 2020, Proud 
Boys activity became even more prolific and confrontational in demonstrations calling for 
support for the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, defunding police, support for LGBTQ 
communities, support for the Abolish ICE movement, and opposition to anti-Asian attacks. After 
the presidential election, the Proud Boys shifted their support to more directly pro-Trump 
activities. 
ACLED found that 97 of the 152 demonstration events in 2020 in which Proud Boys participated 
were explicitly in support of then-President Trump. Over 90 percent of these pro-Trump 
demonstrations occurred after the former president called for the Proud Boys to "stand back and 
stand by" at the first presidential debate on September 29. Proud Boys' participation in 
demonstrations increased significantly leading up to and immediately following the November 
2020 presidential election, with 79 events, or over 60 percent of the group's total protests that 
year, occurred during the fourth quarter of 2020. According to ACLED, "Proud Boys activity 
saw a massive spike when Trump officially lost the election to Joe Biden -a dynamic that once 
more invigorated the group's involvement in violent demonstrations. Twenty-five of 3 7 violent 
demonstration events -or over two-thirds -in which the Proud Boys participated since the 
beginning of 2020 took place between the election on November 3, 2020, and President Biden's 
inauguration on January 20, 2021. "90 It is interesting to note that this increased activity happened 
even though the group lost access to its social media accounts in June 2020, when Facebook 
finally fully deplatformed them (Twitter removed them in 2018).91 The group rather seamlessly 
moved its activity to unregulated sites, in particular Parler, which shut down in January 2021, 
and Telegram.

12  The worst of the violence before January 6 occurred over the weekend of December 12, 2020, 
when police said the Proud Boys amassed their largest gathering in D.C., where 39 people were 
arrested for protest-related actions. Four churches were vandalized, and members of the Proud 
Boys destroyed Black Lives Matter banners at two Black churches in the district. But the 
violence was more extensive than just those attacks. Members also punched a Black woman on 
K Street, attacked protesters in the middle of a crowd and repeatedly kicked them while they lay 
on the ground. They also attacked multiple bystanders with weapons and threw them to the 
ground. While dozens of Proud Boys members rallied outside Harry's Restaurant that night, 
Jeremy Bertino and a large crowd singled out and attacked a solitary Black bystander, Philip 
Johnson, trapping him against a wall and beating him until police intervened.92 Another member 
of the Proud Boys attacked a counterprotester while someone simultaneously screamed, 
"Fucking Jew."93 Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser said of the weekend, "These Proud 
Boys are avowed white nationalists and have been called to stand up against a fair and legal 
election. This is a symptom of the hateful rhetoric, anti-science noise and people who refuse to 
accept the result of a fair American election. "94 
On January 4, 2021, Tarrio was arrested in Washington, D.C., on charges of destruction of 
property in relation to the events of December 12 and illegal possession of high-capacity 
firearms magazines.95 He was banned from Washington, D.C.96 and was not present during the 
storming of the Capitol on January 6. In her ruling banning Tarrio from Washington, D.C., 
Superior Court Magistrate Judge Renee Raymond pointed to Tarrio's social media postings, in 
which Tarrio appeared to threaten more destructive acts, as the reason for keeping him out of 
D.C. 
Proud Boys Plan for the Insurrection 
None of this slowed down the group's propensity for violence. A week before the January 6 
Capitol insurrection, Lawfare reported that Tarrio issued an unusual message to his members. In 
a December 29, 2020, post on Parler, Tarrio requested members "tum out in record numbers" on 
January 6, but this time "with a twist." Changing tactics, Tarrio said, "We will not be wearing 
our traditional Black and Yellow. We will be incognito and we will be spread across downtown 
DC in smaller teams." Other members followed his lead. Joe Biggs, head of the Florida chapter, 
also on Parler, highlighted the importance of "blending in" on January 6. "You won't see 
us ... We are going to smell like you, move like you, and look like you. The only thing we'll do 
that's us is think like us! Jan 6th is gonna be epic."97

13  Evidence uncovered since January 6 and included in various court documents shows that 
members of the group spent months planning to invade the Capitol and that they worked with 
other extremist groups. Most notably, they worked with antigovemment organizations like the 
Oath Keepers, many of whose members have also been arrested for conspiracy, for the 
planning.98 In previous court filings, prosecutors said that around Christmas 2020, Oath Keeper 
leader Stewart Rhodes' lieutenant in Florida, Kelly Meggs, reached out to Tarrio. According to 
prosecutors, Meggs authored a message in December reading, "I organized an alliance between 
Oath Keepers, Florida 3%ers, and Proud Boys."99 Meggs later told other Oath Keeper members 
that the Proud Boys could act as a "force multiplier" on January 6.100 On December 29, 2020, 
D.C.'s Hotel Harrington, a past gathering spot for Proud Boys that apparently was becoming 
concerned about their activities, announced closure from January 4-6, citing public safety. 
Harry's Pub, another Proud Boys hotspot, similarly announced a temporary closure.101 
Though Tarrio was absent from Washington, D.C. that day, he played a key role in the days 
leading up to the events on January 6. Tarrio said on Parler that the Proud Boys would "tum out 
in record numbers on Jan 6th" referring to his members as "the most notorious group of 
extraordinary gentlemen."102 Tarrio and the Proud Boys' elders chapter were instrumental in 
what unfolded that day, according to allegations made by prosecutors. According to court 
documents, a new "Ministry of Self-Defense" was described by one Proud Boy as a "special 
chapter" of the organization that was dedicated to planning for January 6. On December 29, 
2020, Tarrio announced the leadership and structure of the "Ministry of Self-Defense," which 
included himself, Ethan Nordean (also known as Rufio Panman, a Proud Boy organizer from 
Washington state and an elder in the group),103 Joe Biggs (a Proud Boys organizer from 
Florida), 104 and Zach Rehl, (leader of the organization's Philadelphia chapter). Prosecutors allege 
the Ministry held a video call to prepare for January 6 and discussed how the upcoming event 
would differ from other recent Proud Boy rallies in Washington, D.C.105 
According to prosecutors, Proud Boys chats were filled with bellicose rhetoric hoping Trump 
supporters, referred to as "normies," would "bum that city to ash today." Another poster wrote "I 
will settle with seeing them smash some pigs to dust." At one point, one of the leaders wrote 
"Storming the Capitol now" and urged others in the chat to "get there," according to court 
filings. A Proud Boy and Queens resident, Eduard Florea, threatened to bring "three cars full of 
armed patriots" to Washington in early January. Florea was charged by federal authorities with 
stockpiling military-style combat knives and more than 1,000 rifle rounds in his New York 
home. He was also charged with possessing ammunition as a convicted felon and denied bail 
after the FBI searched his Queens home and interviewed him about a series of threats he made

suggested staging attacks in New York, calling the area, "target rich."106 Florea continued 
posting during the Capitol storming, writing, "the time for peace and civility is over ... guns 
cleaned and loaded ... we are just waiting for the word." 
Reuters reported in February 2022, that on January 5, the day before the insurrection, there was a 
meeting of about a half dozen far-right leaders in a parking garage in D.C., which the FBI is now 
investigating. In the garage were Tarrio, who was not in DC the following day, Stewart Rhodes, 
leader of the Oath Keepers antigovernment group who has now been indicted for seditious 
conspiracy, and other far-right figures. The meeting puts the heads of the nation's two best­
known pro-Trump extremist groups in immediate proximity to each other 24 hours before the 
breach of the Capitol. Also there was Bianca Gracia, who heads Latinos for Trump, a group 
Tarrio was involved in, and Kellye SoRelle, a lawyer for the Oath Keepers and Latinos for 
Trump. SoRelle told Reuters she was invited by Gracia to meet Tarrio and share information 
about criminal defense attorneys. She said her role in the meeting was brief and did not concern 
plans for the next day.107 
On March 8, 2022, Tarrio was arrested for conspiring with other Proud Boys leaders to disrupt 
the certification of the 2020 presidential election by helping to plan and launch the 2021 attack 
on the Capitol.108 New evidence discloses Tarrio's alleged role in discussions that preceded the 
violence at the Capitol. On Dec. 30 and 31, prosecutors charge, Tarrio exchanged messages with 
an individual who sent him a plan called "1776 Returns" to occupy "crucial buildings" in 
Washington, including House and Senate buildings, with "as many people as possible." The 
intent was to "show our politicians We the People are in charge." After sending the document, the 
individual allegedly messaged Tarrio that the "revolution is [sic] important than anything." 
Tarrio allegedly replied: "That's what every waking moment consists of ... I'm not playing 
games."109 
The March 8 indictment further substantiates allegations of ties between Tarrio and Rhodes, 
noting that even after Tarrio was ordered by a court to leave Washington, he did not do so right 
away.110 It cites the parking garage meeting on January 5 and alleges that a participant referenced 
the Capitol. The indictment also charges that even after Tarrio's arrest for destroying the BLM 
banners on December 12, he continued to communicate electronically in a message group with 
other Proud Boys leaders as they coordinated their actions on January 6. Prosecutors say at 3 
p.m. on January 6, as the angry mob was ransacking the Capitol, Tarrio posted a social media 
message that said "1776" -a reference to the December 30 plan to occupy government 
buildings. The indictment alleges Tarrio continued to direct and encourage the Proud Boys 
despite being outside ofD.C. that day and claimed credit for what had happened on social media 
and in an encrypted chatroom during and after the attack.

15  Additional facts were brought to light by the March 8 indictment regarding the Proud Boys' 
planning for January 6. When Tarrio and about 60 other leaders and members organized the 
"Ministry of Self-Defense," they arranged to travel to Washington from cities around the country 
and used their private Telegram chat to make various statements "about attacking the Capitol." 
When one member of the group asked if the authorities would shoot if "I million patriots 
stormed and took the capital [sic] building," the indictment said another member answered: 
"They would do nothing because they can do nothing."111 Another member of the group 
allegedly posted a voice note on the Telegram group chat, saying that "the main operating 
theater" on January 6 should be "out in front of the House of Representatives." "That's where the 
vote is taking place and all of the objections," he said.112 
The Proud Boys raised funds based on their plans for January 6. In addition to selling 
merchandise through their 1776shop.com, charging documents have revealed that Nordean 
messaged with an individual who offered to give $1,000 to the Proud Boys "travel fund" to send 
a "combat veteran and a Marine [who] wants to get in the street and fight" to join group 
members on January 6.113 Reporting of a leak by USA Today revealed a huge influx of donations 
to the group from Chinese communities that started on December 17. In all, almost 1,000 people 
with Chinese surnames gave about $86,000 to a fundraiser for the Proud Boys on the 
crowdfunding platform GiveSendGo. Their gifts made up more than 80 percent of the 
$106,107 raised for medical costs for members of the Proud Boys who were stabbed during 
violent clashes in Washington in mid-December. According to USA Today, the Proud Boys 
enjoy significant support from a slice of the Chinese American community and the broader 
Chinese diaspora: "Some Chinese Americans have bought in to the rhetoric spread by the Proud 
Boys, conspiracy theorists such as Alex Jones and conservative commentators that America 
is under attack from communism."114 
Crowdfunding sites were also used by Proud Boys after the insurrection to raise funds by 
portraying themselves as maligned American patriots, martyrs and "political prisoners."115 
Proud Boys Played Key Role in Capitol Insurrection 
It is unclear how many members of the Proud Boys participated in the attack on the Capitol 
building, but some members of the group appeared wearing orange hats116 and others wore all 
black clothing, rather than their usual black and yellow attire, as Tarrio had suggested earlier and 
which prosecutors said was an apparent reference to mimicking the appearance of antifa 
members.117 Other members of the group proudly displayed their patches and other insignia and

16  many also divulged their involvement through selfies and other material they put in the public 
domain online. 
The Proud Boys' actions related to January 6 have become clearer through court records. On the 
evening of January 5, participating Proud Boys were allegedly instructed to meet at the 
Washington Monument at 10:00 AM the following day to await further orders, wearing plain 
clothes and "no colors."118 Facts that are now in evidence show that at 10:58 AM, a Proud Boys 
contingent left the monument area and marched toward the Capitol. 119 The contingent reached 
the west perimeter of the Capitol grounds, which was not heavily protected by police stationed in 
front of a temporary fence. Other Trump supporters arrived at the same location, forming a 
growing crowd. The mob, including Proud Boy Joey Biggs, rushed the fences and clashed with 
the police. By about 1 :00 PM, rioters stormed through the barriers and onto the Capitol grounds 
for the first time, as police struggled to contain them.120 An hour earlier, a Federal Protective 
Service briefing email stated that there were about 300 Proud Boys at the Capitol and warned 
that the Proud Boys were threatening to shut down the downtown water system.121 It is unclear if 
there were actually that many members of the group, but several have been charged for various 
offenses, most seriously conspiracy. 
Just after the Capitol was breached, one Proud Boy messaged Tarrio, "I told you we should have 
rushed the police line on [December] 12th."122 Tarrio, who was not present, said in a text 
message that day at 2:30 PM, "Make no mistake ... we did this."123 
The first indictment in February 2021 targeted four leaders of the Proud Boys for allegedly 
conspiring, including in discussions on encrypted messaging apps, to obstruct the certification of 
Biden's Electoral College victory. The indictment charged the defendants -Ethan Nordean, 
Joseph "Joe" Biggs, Zach Rehl, and Charles Donohoe -with six counts, including obstruction 
of an official proceeding, obstruction of law enforcement, destruction of government property, 
and conspiracy. The indictment lists Nordean as president of his local Proud Boy chapter in 
Washington state; Biggs as a Proud Boy member and organizer in Florida; Rehl as the president 
of a local chapter in Philadelphia; and Donohoe as the president of his local Proud Boy chapter 
in North Carolina. 
The indictment indicates that the government believes it has sufficient evidence of close 
coordination among Proud Boys during the insurrection. The government's motion to revoke 
Nordean's pretrial release, described a high level of coordination: "Defendant and co­
conspirators Joseph Biggs and Zack Rehl were at the head of the pack, as they led the group 
from the Washington Monument to the U.S. Capitol with the purpose of interfering with the

17  Electoral College certification. Defendant's leadership role in the surge forward and the group's 
coordinated action to dismantle metal barriers reflects the results of the plan that he and the co­
conspirators drew up. The photos and videos clearly show a series of intentional actions made 
without hesitation or regret -including video footage ofNordean personally dismantling a metal 
barrier that separated the crowd from Capitol Police officers and the Capitol itself."124 
A magistrate judge in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia has described the 
attack as "terrorism." During a court hearing for Charles Donohue, U.S. Magistrate Judge G. 
Michael Harvey said, "The acts alleged in the indictment would meet, in my view, the statutory 
definition of a federal crime of terrorism," adding that the attack "struck at the very heart of our 
democracy."125 
Court documents have also raised questions about the relationship between top-ranking Proud 
Boys and Dominic Pezzola, a.k.a. Spazzo, a Proud Boy from Rochester, New York. Pezzola is 
facing conspiracy charges and was allegedly responsible for the first breach of the Capitol when 
he smashed through a window. On March 8, 2022, a new indictment charged Pezzola as being 
part of an alleged Proud Boys conspiracy involving Tarrio and others.126 Investigators said in 
January that they found a thumb drive full of bomb making instructions when they searched his 
home. Proud Boy leaders have denied having anything to do with him. But Proud Boys 
"Ministry of Self-Defense" Telegram chats, which he was a member of, suggest otherwise.127 
As of March 2022, more than three dozen people charged in the Capitol siege have been 
identified by federal authorities as Proud Boys leaders, members, or associates, including at least 
18 defendants charged with conspiracy.128 Of the total of 40 conspiracy defendants, the vast 
majority are either Oath Keepers or Proud Boys.129 In late December 2021, Lawfare reported that 
Proud Boys prosecutions are more numerous, splintered and harder to count definitively, a result 
perhaps of Tarrio's instructions that members remain "incognito" and act in "smaller teams." 
The Fallout from January 6 
After the Capitol attack, some members of the Proud Boys celebrated the events. "I'm proud as 
fl'*k at what we accomplished yesterday," Rehl wrote, according to prosecutors.130 In a poll on 
January 11, just days of the insurrection, on the Proud Boys Uncensored Telegram channel, 75 
percent of more than 10,000 supporters of the group voted that they now wanted "total war."131 
In late January, it became public that Tarrio was an informant for both federal and local law 
enforcement agencies between 2012 and 2014.132 After January 6, Tarrio was apparently also

18  financially strapped and had resorted to selling Black Lives Matter T-shirts as his product sales 
dried up and payment processors dropped him.133 Inside the group, Tarrio's informant work and 
looming prosecutions led to schisms. The Alabama Proud Boys chapter officially disavowed him 
on Telegram and "all chapters that choose to associate with him." The St. Louis branch 
announced: "This group needs new leadership and a new direction ... The fame we've attained 
hasn't been worth it." One participant in the chat wrote: "Traitors are everywhere, 
everywhere."134 The group's Canadian chapters shut down after they were listed as a "terrorist 
entity" by that country's government in February 2021.135 The Canadian government determined 
that the group was fundamentally violent and "fueled by white supremacy."136 
Shortly after the Capitol attack, Tarrio ordered a nationwide three-month standdown that angered 
Nordean. "They're coming for you no matter what," Nordean said in a chat. "Wake the hell up. 
I'm not gonna be sitting on my ass waiting for the end." Regardless of the standdown, Nordean 
helped coordinate a cabin trip for top-level Proud Boys after January 6 and wrote in a Telegram 
post that they would discuss changing their traditional uniform and other matters including six­
month and one-year plans, secure vetting for prospective members, bulk armor deals, and the 
Ministry of Self-Defense. 137 The national leadership was reportedly disbanded, but local 
chapters continue to function. 
Not all chapters complied with the stand down, but VICE found "that there was a relative lull in 
Proud Boy activity between January and March 2021-just nine uniformed appearances in total 
during those three months, in four different states-compared to the rest of the year. After that 
three-month hiatus, scattered Proud Boy activity began popping up around popular right-wing 
issues like gun rights and mask mandates-as well as more nebulous causes, like 'freedom."'138 
Tarrio also remained at the head of the organization, saying in June 2021 that he would step 
down the following September to concentrate on his local chapter. 139 His position currently 
remains unclear. 
The Proud Boys are facing additional challenges. In April 2021, ten House democrats including 
House Judiciary Committee chair Representative Jerrold Nadler signed onto a NAACP civil suit 
against former President Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani, the Proud Boys, and the Oath Keepers 
over their involvement with the January 6 attack, alleging the ex-president and his allies illegally 
violated the Ku Klux Klan Act by inciting the riot.140 The suit alleges the defendants "acted in

19  concert to incite and then carry out a riot at the Capitol" in order to stop Congress from certifying 
the election results. The Klan Act is a Reconstruction-era statute that bars Americans from 
conspiring to "to prevent, by force, intimidation, or threat, any person from accepting or holding 
any office, trust, or place of confidence under the United States" or "discharging any duties 
thereof. "141 
The Proud Boys are also facing another major civil suit brought by Washington, D.C., Attorney 
General Karl Racine in December 2021. Filed in federal court, the suit accuses 31 members of 
the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers of "conspiring to terrorize the District" on January 6, calling 
their actions "a coordinated act of domestic terrorism." Racine is asking the court to find the 
Oath Keepers and Proud Boys liable for the millions of dollars that officials spent dispatching 
officers from the Metropolitan Police Department to the Capitol, along with the enormous 
expense of treating the injured officers and paying for their medical leave in the months after the 
attack. Three officers from the Capitol Police and Metropolitan Police departments died in the 
days after the attack, and more than 140 officers were injured.142 
The Proud Boys have been able to raise funds from the prosecutions. Leaders have created a 
Telegram channel called "Free the Boys" to raise money for arrested members. The channel 
directs visitors to crowdfunding pages on GiveSendGo and Our Freedom Funding, as well as the 
mobile payment service Cash App. A similar Telegram channel for other people facing charges 
related to the insurrection has amassed more than 14,000 subscribers.143 By April 2021, a data 
leak analyzed by The Guardian showed that in "at least 11 crowdfunding campaigns associated 
with the Proud Boys, members of the group, including some now facing conspiracy charges 
related to the Capitol attack, raised over $375,000."144 Some fundraisers netted large amounts of 
money in a short period. After Tarrio was arrested on January 4 for the December 12 vandalism 
at Black churches, a "fundraiser billed as a 'defense fund' made $113,000 in just four days."145 
Also, "a large proportion of that money came from a number of high-dollar donors who elected 
to be anonymous on the website, but whose identifying details were nevertheless preserved by 
GiveSendGo."146 Examples included $1,000 from Gabe Carrera, a Florida-based personal injury 
lawyer. Another $1,000 was associated with an email address belonging to Paul C. Gill, a 
Hawaiian Airlines employee who has previously donated to Trump's campaigns. A Florida­
based pharmacist, Gerardo G. Gonzalez, anonymously donated $1,000 to Tarrio on January 7. 
GiveSendGo continues to host fundraisers for Proud Boys members.147 
Proud Boys Remain Highly Active 
It is unclear ifTarrio remains head of the group as of early March 2022. Regardless ofTarrio's 
imprisonment, the January 6 prosecutions, the civil suits, and other fallout from that day, the

20  Proud Boys have not collapsed. Far from it. They have active Telegram channels with tens of 
thousands of members.148 Six months after January 6, on the group's Western Chauvinist 
channel, which is now explicitly white supremacist, posters were actively sharing racist 
conspiracy theories like the "Great Replacement."149 There is substantial evidence that the Proud 
Boys have been growing in terms of chapters and activities, especially at the local level. In 
January 2022, a VICE analysis of Proud Boy Telegram channels found that the group claimed to 
have at least 157 active American chapters in every state but three and Washington, D.C. Their 
data suggested that there are at least thousands of members in the U.S.150 Using a different metric 
than VICE, looking at on the ground activities, the Southern Poverty Law Center reported in 
March 2022 that the group's chapters rose by 29, from 43 in 2020 to 72 in 2021.151 
Perhaps more striking is that in the six months after January 6, the Proud Boys held 20 different 
events, some of which turned violent.152 In the year after January 6, VICE found that Proud 
Boys made at least 114 uniformed appearances across 73 cities in 24 states.153 The data most 
likely understates the Proud Boys' activities as the group has moved into new areas of protest, 
such as showing up at school board meetings. Thus, while post-January 6 pressure from law 
enforcement was sufficient to impact some Proud Boys chapters and the activities of individuals 
in specific areas, the group and its chapters continued planning a significant number of violent 
and intimidating activities in 2021. 
Just like in the days prior to the insurrection, Proud Boys continue to confront left-wing 
demonstrators. On August 23, 2021, the Proud Boys held a rally in Portland, Oregon, where they 
clashed with antifa.154 But they have broadened out their activities and interests and focused 
largely on the local level, shifting attention to local chapters and small communities. NPR 
reported in October 2021, that "Members of the group have attended anti-abortion 'prayer' 
events with conservative Christian organizations; they've protested the removal of Confederate 
monuments in North Carolina; in Washington state, they responded to a false rumor that a 
student would be arrested for not wearing a mask, prompting the lockdown of three 
schools."155 The goal apparently is to amass more supporters in time to influence next year's 
midterm elections. 
These changes have led members to appear at town council gatherings, school board 
presentations, and health department question-and-answer sessions across the country. Their 
presence at the events is part of a strategy shift by the organization toward a larger goal: to bring 
their brand of menacing politics to the local level. 156 And they have been clear about their new 
strategy. "The plan of attack if you want to make change is to get involved at the local level,"

21  said Jeremy Bertino, a prominent member of the Proud Boys from North Carolina. Examples 
abound of these activities. Members showed up at school board building in Beloit, Wisconsin, to 
protest school masking requirements. They turned up at a school board meeting in New Hanover 
County, North Carolina, before a vote on a mask mandate. They attended a gathering in Downers 
Grove, Illinois, where parents were trying to remove a nonbinary author's graphic novel from 
public school libraries. At some local meetings where the Proud Boys have shown up, they have 
spoken and threatened community leaders.157 At others, they have simply stood silently, and 
menacingly, and watched events. On Telegram, some members have said they handed out 
cellphone numbers to potential recruits. 
The new local focus is reflected in the Proud Boys' online activity. On Telegram, the Proud 
Boys' main group in the United States has barely budged in number -with about 31,000 
followers -over the last year. But over a dozen new Telegram channels have emerged for local 
Proud Boys chapters in cities such as Seattle and Philadelphia over that same period, according 
to data collected by The New York Times. Those local Telegram groups have rapidly grown from 
dozens to hundreds ofmembers.158 
Proud Boys have also been involved directly in politics at the local level. In Nevada, Proud Boys 
have tried to exert control over the local GOP. In Kansas City, Proud Boy Josh Wells, who is 
running for the school board, told undercover antifascists in April that he wants "white 
nationalism and/or a pro-Western Christian theocracy with a protected white majority status. 
Whichever one is more obtainable." Luis Miguel, an underdog U.S. Senate candidate in Florida, 
declared in July his commitment to the far-right activists who attended his campaign events: 
"Proud Boys, Oathkeepers and Threepercenters have often been the only ones defending 
innocent Americans from violent Antifa commies. I am PROUD to stand with these patriots."159 
Another person seeking local office is Joel Campbell, a former Proud Boy running for City 
Council in Topeka, Kan.160 At the state level, a self-acknowledged member of the Proud Boys, is 
running for an assembly seat. The candidate, Jeffrey Erik Perrine, was expelled from the 
Sacramento County Republican Party.161
