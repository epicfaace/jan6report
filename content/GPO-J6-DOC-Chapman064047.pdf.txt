Subject: What's the latest? 
Rudy, 
I am having to defend myself before administrators at two different Universities. Not a problem, but it would help if I could 
have the dossier on antifa involvement in the Capitol breach last week. Can you send me what your team has gathered 
thus far? 
Second-what's the latest on impeachment team? Do we know who is going to be involved? 
Third, I've decided that I should be on the pardon list, if that is still in the works. Will taint me, but given the outright lies and 
false witness being spewed, having that protection is probably the prudent course. 
Fourth, I'm working up an invoice and will get it to you as soon as I'm able to turn to it. 
Thank you, 
John Eastman
