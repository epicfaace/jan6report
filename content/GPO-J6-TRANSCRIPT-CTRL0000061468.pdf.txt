3 - And so we're on the record at 9:58 a.m. 
Good morning. This is the deposition of Bianca Gracia, conducted by the House 
4 Select Committee to investigate the January 6th attack on the United States Capitol, 
5 pursuant to House Resolution 503. 
6 This deposition is being conducted via Zoom. This will be a staff-led deposition, 
7 though Members may choose to join the Zoom call and ask questions. 
8 At this time, I'd ask the witness to please state your full name and spell your last 
9 name for the record. 
10 The Witness. Bianca Gracia, G-r-a-c-i-a. 
11 - My name is-. I'm an investigative counsel with the 
12 Select Committee. There are no other staff from the Select Committee on the call right 3 
13 now and no other members, but if people choose to join, I'll try to announce them as they 
14 come in so that you know who's in the room. 
15 The Witness. Okay. 
16 - And then I'd also ask at this time for counsel for Ms. Gracia to state 
17 his name for the record. 
18 Mr. Mills. Good morning. It's Laurin Mills for Ms. Gracia. And as we 
19 discussed before, make a short statement. Ms. Gracia is appearing here, respecting the 
20 committee's authority here to subpoena her. 
21 However, in light of comments made by the Attorney General and the Deputy 
22 Attorney General, and by the committee and filings in the Central District of California 
23 and by a judge in the Central District of California, she has opted to invoke her rights 
24 under the Fifth Amendment, not to be a witness against herself. 
25 And so after you swear her in, every answer she's going to give is, I rely on my  1 Fifth Amendment privilege. And that's how we will proceed. And are you okay with 
2 that shorthand,-? 
3 - That's --yeah, that's going to be fine. I'll have a few kind of 
4 clarifying statements once we get started as well, but, yeah, we can go with shorthand 
5 after the first invocation. 
6 You know, actually, if you can just give me one second while a staff member is 
7 trying to join the call. 
8 
9 Mr. Mills. Okay. 
- Okay. All right. Thank you for that, Mr. Mills. 
10 So under House deposition rules, neither committee members, nor staff, may 4 
11 discuss the substance of the testimony today, unless the committee approves for release. 
12 And then also note under House rules, you may have your attorney present, which 
13 obviously you do, but counsel for other individuals, or attorneys for other government 
14 agencies may not be present and are, therefore, not present today. 
15 And then I'll also note for the record, that we've had join. 
16 He's another investigative counsel with the Select Committee. 
17 What has been previously marked as exhibit 1 is the Select Committee's January 
18 19, 2022 subpoena for Ms. Bianca Gracia. The House deposition rules are included in 
19 that exhibit. 
20 We've also had a couple more individuals join. We've had_, 
21 investigative counsel for the committee, and , who's a consultant with 
22 the committee and on the committee staff as well. 
23 So, Ms. Gracia, there's an official reporter that's transcribing the record of this 
24 deposition. So to make her job a little bit easier, if you can just wait until I complete my 
25 questions before you begin your response. We'll try to wait --and then I'll also try to  1 wait until you've completed your answer before I begin my next question. 
2 It's just difficult for the court reporter to try to transcribe two people speaking at 
3 the same time. Does that make sense? 
4 
5 The Witness. Yes. 
- Okay. And then along the same lines, you need to use verbal 
6 responses today, as opposed to, like, a head shake. So just make sure that you try to 
7 use yes or no or a similar answer when I ask a question. 
8 And then also today, all we ask is that you provide complete answers to the best 
9 of your recollection. If a question is not clear, please ask for clarification or ask me to 
10 restate it. And if you don't know the answer, you can simply say so. 
11 The Witness. Okay. 
12 - Also note, and Mr. Mills has already addressed for the record, that 
13 you may refuse to answer a question to preserve a privilege recognized by the select 
14 committee, privileges like the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. 
15 If you refuse to answer a question based on a privilege, staff may either proceed 5 
16 with the deposition or seek a ruling from the chairman on the objection. If the chairman 
17 overrules such an objection, you'll be required to answer the question. 
18 And then, I also want to remind you that it's unlawful --and we provide this 
19 warning for everybody we speak to --that it's unlawful to deliberately provide false 
20 information to Congress. 
21 Providing false information could result in criminal penalties for perjury or false 
22 statements, including under 18 U.S.C. 1001, which makes it illegal to provide a false 
23 statement to an congressional investigator like myself, or some of the others that I've 
24 announced on this call. Does that all make sense to you? 
25 The Witness. Yes.  1 - That being said, I want to make clear that this is a congressional 
2 investigation and not a criminal investigation. This proceeding is separate and distinct 
3 from any current criminal proceeding by the United States Department of Justice. Do 
4 you understand that? 
5 
6 The Witness. Yes. 
- Okay. And then throughout today and throughout our 
7 conversation, if you need any breaks, just let me know. I'll try to take a break about 
8 every hour or so, but if you need one at a different time, feel free to say so. 
9 The Witness. Okay. 
10 And then, I'll mostly be leading our conversation today and asking 
11 most of the questions, but occasionally, other staffers or a member might join the 
12 discussion and ask a follow-up question for you, so that may occur. 
13 And then lastly, because this is a deposition, you are --or you will be under oath. 
14 So could you please raise your right hand to be sworn. 
15 The Reporter. Do you solemnly swear and affirm under the penalty of perjury 
16 that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing 
17 but the truth? 
18 
19 
20 
21 The Witness. I do. 
The Reporter. Thank you. 
The Witness. Yes. 
- Great. And then to start, sort of a housekeeping matter, I'm going 
22 to pull up exhibit 1, which you should be able to see on your screen now. Can you see 
23 that? 
24 
25 The Witness. Yes. 
- Okay. And this is the January 19, 2022 subpoena issued to you by 6  1 the select committee. Have you seen this document before? 
2 The Witness. Yes. 
3 - Okay. And I'll note, obviously at the top of there, we've got Bianca 
4 Gracia, and I just want to confirm that you're the individual named in this subpoena. Is 
5 that correct? 
6 
7 The Witness. Yes. 
- Okay. Great. And then I'm scrolling down to page 5 of this 
8 document, which is a schedule of documents requested in the subpoena. Have you 
9 seen this document schedule before? 
10 
11 The Witness. Yes. 
- Okay. And am I right that in response to the subpoena, which calls 
12 for the production of documents, you've produced no documents, correct? 
13 Mr. Mills. I'm going to --we have already asserted the act-of-production 
14 privilege with regard to that. 
15 - Sure. And just as an initial matter, you know, I'm going to need 7 
16 Ms. Gracia to assert those privileges on the record. So really just a housekeeping matter 
17 to get her to put that on the record. 
18 
19 
20 Mr. Mills. So, Bianca, you can say, I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
- Okay. And then also as an additional matter, I just want to make 
21 sure --I'm sure you've had conversations with Mr. Mills about this, but I want to make 
22 sure you understand what it means to invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege. 
23 And so, I hope that you understand that by invoking the Fifth Amendment right 
24 against self-incrimination, you're indicating that you believe that truthful answers to my 
25 question would be incriminating.  8 
1 Mr. Mills. I object to that characterization. The Fifth Amendment says nothing 
2 about incrimination. It says she has a right not to be a witness against herself. And 
3 that's the objection. So that's the privilege she's asserting. 
4 - Do you understand that by providing truthful answers to these 
5 questions and invoking the Fifth Amendment right, that you believe that the answers to 
6 your questions could be used against you in a criminal case? 
7 The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege not to be a witness against 
8 myself. 
9 - Okay. And it's also your position that collecting documents and 
10 producing documents would also amount to being used as a witness against yourself? Is 
11 that the case? 
12 The Witness. I rely on my Fifth Amendment Privilege not to be a witness against 
13 myself. 
14 - Thank you.

5 questions to understand the scope of your Fifth Amendment objection and also

25 worked with them for those purposes.  1 The first entity I want to address is Women for America First. Are you familiar

21 
22 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
In your --just continuing on the theme of kind of preparation and planning 
23 for the 5th and the 6th. In your preparation and planning for those events, did you 
24 consider any security threats or how to deal with them if they arose on that day? 
25 A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege.  12 
1 Q Okay. How about security threats posed by extremist groups that might've 
2 been present in D.C. around that time? 
3 
4 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Okay. And I just want to clarify or state that I have a series of questions 
5 about individuals who may have posed a security threat to you or your organization on 
6 January 5th or 6th, and would it be your intention to invoke the Fifth Amendment with 
7 respect to any security threats that you recognized or planned for on the 5th or the 6th?

Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege.

Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
I have a series of questions about your communications and interactions 
24 with Ms. Chafian. Would it be your intention to invoke the Fifth for any and all 
25 questions about your interactions with Ms. Chafian related to January 5th or 6th?  1 
2 
3 A 
Q 
A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
If you did speak on January 5th, were you paid for your speech? 
I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
4 Q Okay. And then, I also want to ask just some kind of logistical questions 13 
5 about your trip to Washington, D.C. for January 5th and 6th, 2021. Where did you stay

Okay. I have, again, a series of questions about just kind of the logistics of 
14 your attendance at these events, where you stayed, who paid for those accommodations. 
15 Would it be your intention to invoke the Fifth Amendment for any questions related to 
16 your travel around January 5th and 6th? 
17 
18 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Okay. You've mentioned previously --or I mentioned previously in this 
19 deposition, Mr. Enrique Tarrio, and I just want to ask you a few questions about him and 
20 how you know him and what your interactions with him have been. 
21 So I'll start just generally, do you know Mr. Tarrio? 
22 
23 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Okay. I had some more specific questions about Mr. Tarrio and his 
24 involvement in Latinos for Trump. Can you tell me what positions, if any, he's held in 
25 the organization Latinos for Trump?  1 
2 A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Q We have collected documents and testimony from other witnesses who've 
3 indicated that on November 13th, Mr. Tarrio flew with other Proud Boys from Miami to 
4 Washington, D.C. for the rallies in D.C. on November 14th. Were you aware of this 
flight? 
A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Q Okay. Did you help pay for this flight? 
I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 14 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 A 
Q If you did not pay for the flight, do you know who did pay for those flights to 
10 D.C. on November 13th? 
11 
12 A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Q Okay. Again, I have a series of questions about Mr. Tarrio's travel to 
13 Washington, D.C. for the events of November 14th and your knowledge of payments for 
14 those flights and other individuals that might've been on the flight. 
15 Is it your intention to invoke the Fifth Amendment with respect to any questions 
16 about the flight with Mr. Tarrio and other Proud Boys from Miami to Washington on 
17 D.C. --to D.C. for November 13th. Would you invoke the Fifth for all of those questions? 
18 
19 A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Q Similarly, other witnesses and evidence that we've collected have indicated 
20 that Mr. Thad Cisneros, who also has some ties to the organization Latinos for Trump, was 
21 flown by private plane to Washington, D.C. for the events of January 6th. Were you 
22 aware of this flight?

Did Latinos for Trump help pay for that flight?

Okay. Is Mr. Byrne a financier, or does he contribute to Latinos for Trump? 
I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Okay. Again, I have a series of questions about Mr. Byrne and his relation 
10 to the organization, Latinos for Trump. Would it be your intention to invoke the Fifth 
11 Amendment with respect to any questions about Mr. Byrne and his relation to that 
12 organization? 
13 
14 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Would you also invoke the Fifth with respect to any questions about Mr. 
15 Byrne and his financing of the flights that we previously identified? 
16 
17 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Okay. I'd like to move to another topic. Also in advance of the events of 
18 January 5th and 6th --this is in December of 2020 --did you visit the White House at any 
19 time? 
20 
21 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Can you tell me, if you did visit the White House, what your reason for 
22 visiting the White House was? 
23 
24 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Did Mr. Tarrio visit the White House with you for --in that December visit to 
25 the White House?  1 
2 A 
Q I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Okay. And I have a series of questions about this White House visit in 
3 December. Would it be your intention to invoke the Fifth Amendment with respect to 
4 all questions about any visits you had to the White House in December of 2020? 
5 
6 
7 A 
Q 
A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Okay. Did you or Mr. Tarrio meet President Trump during this visit? 
I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
8 Q Okay. I would like to ask that she --I'd like to ask some questions about 16 
9 some other elected officials that you may have had contact with. So I'm going to pull up 
10 what we've premarked as exhibit 3. And can you see this document? Are you able to 
11 see this, Ms. Gracia? 
12 Oh, I know that you're on your --
13 
14 A 
Q Yeah. 
--on your phone, so it might be a little difficult to read. I can read to you 
15 from the document, and if we need to provide a copy for you to view some other way, we 
16 can try to do that. But what I'll represent to you is that these are phone records that we 
17 have collected from T-Mobile related to your phone number, 
18 And I've, through those phone records, identified some specific calls I'd like to ask 
19 you about. And if you can just tell me if you remember the phone call and remember 
20 what the topic of discussion was on the phone call. 
21 So first, I'd like to ask you about a November 24th phone call to Senator Cornyn's 
22 office. Do you recall this phone call? 
23 A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
24 Q And do you recall what you discussed with Senator Cornyn or his staff on this 
25 phone call?  1 
2 A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Q Okay. I'd also like to look at a series of phone calls from November 30th 17 
3 from your phone to --two calls to a White House landline and two calls to a White House 
4 cell phone. Do you recall phone calls on November 30th to any White House phone 
5 numbers? 
6 
7 A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Q And could you tell me what the topics of conversations during those phone 
8 calls were? 
9 A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
10 - And, again, I'll just say one more time --and Mr. Mills, if it makes 
11 Ms. Gracia more comfortable for you to direct her, I'm fine if you just want to say "Fifth," 
12 instead of "I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege" and we can move things along a little 
13 faster. 
14 Mr. Mills. Thank you. We'll just stick with this shorthand that we, you 
15 know --we'll go with it. But thanks for the offer though. 
16 - Sure. 
17 BY-: 
18 Q Then again on November 30th, there's a phone call to Representative 
19 Ba bin's office. Do you recall this phone call? 
20 
21 A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Q Okay. Later in November --or, sorry --December 1st, you made a call to 
22 Representative Weber's office. Do you recall this phone call? 
23 
24 A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Q Okay. And then we'll move to December 22nd, again a series of phone calls 
25 to White House numbers, a land line and a cell phone. Do you recall calling the White  18 
1 House on December 22nd? 
A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 2 
3 Q Okay. And then finally, also on that same day, December 22nd, it looks like 
4 you called Senator Cruz' office. Do you recall this phone call? 
5 
6 
7 
8 A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Q And do you recall the topics of conversations during that phone call? 
A I rely on my Fifth Amendment privilege. 
Q And for all these calls that I've just identified for you, did any of the topics of 
9 conversation involve planning for rallies or events in Washington, D.C.? 
10
