21 Q Thank you, Ms. Martin. So this is going to be a staff-led deposition and 
22 members of the select committee may also choose to ask questions, but I don't see any 
23 
24 on the Webex with us right now. My name is 
on the Webex with me today is senior investigative counsel 
25 investigative counsel-investigative counsel. And 
As well as  4 
1 For this deposition we will follow the House deposition rules that we provided to 
2 you previously. And under the House deposition rules you are permitted to have an 
3 attorney present. But I will note for the record that you do not have an attorney 
4 present. 
5 Under the House deposition rules neither committee members nor staff may 
6 discuss the substance of testimony you provide today unless the committee approves 
7 release. You will have an opportunity to review the transcript if you so desire. 
8 And before we begin, I'd like to describe a few ground rules. There's an official 
9 reporter transcribing the record of this deposition. The reporter is also joining us by 
10 Webex. So please wait until each question is completed before you begin your response 
11 and we will try to wait until your response is complete before we ask our next question. 
12 It is just way easier for the reporters to hear if we are not talking over one 
13 another. And for the benefit of the reporter and the record, there may be times where I 
14 spell a name or a word that we are using or ask you to do the same. 
15 And we ask that you provide complete answers based on your best recollection. 
16 If the question is not clear, just please ask for clarification, it happens. And if you do not 
17 know the answer, please simply say so. 
18 Logistically please let us know if you need any breaks for comfort or otherwise. 
19 And throughout this deposition you won't be able to see them, so usually we would be 
20 directing you to exhibits. I have them ready and I will describe them to you as we go. 
21 You may only refuse to answer a question to preserve a privilege recognized by 
22 the select committee. If you refuse to answer a question based on a privilege, staff may 
23 either proceed with the deposition or seek a ruling from the chairman on the objection. 
24 If the chairman overrules such an objection, you are required to answer the question. 
25 I also want to remind you as we do with all witnesses that it is unlawful to  1 deliberately provide false information to Congress. Since this deposition is under oath, 
2 providing false information could result in criminal penalties to include for perjury and or 
3 providing false statements. 
4 Do you understand, Ms. Martin? 
5 
6 The Witness. Yes. 
- Great thank you so much. So we'll get into the substantive 
7 questions right now and start with a little bit of background information?

19 called in a different direction. 
20 Q Understood. But when you were, you know, an active member let's say, 
21 what was the --a normal activity for the Panhandle Patriots to do besides riding

Q Okay. And who founded the Panhandle Patriots? 
A I don't --I don't feel comfortable naming names right now. I'm sorry.  8 
1 I just --if I can be direct with you, I --I don't think this is a --a place for truth finding. 
2 think this is a place where you're building a narrative. And I --I'm going to plead the 
3 Fifth on that. I'm sure you guys have that information already so. 
4 Q Well I understand that you plead the Fifth, but to plead the Fifth you need to 
5 have a reasonable belief that the information you are withholding could lead to criminal 
6 prosecution for yourself. Is that what you believe? 
7 A Nope. I --I don't know how you're going to spin your narrative around. 
8 See, I looked through the paperwork you've given me and I need you to explain to 
9 me what you consider an attack, because you say this is for an attack on the Capitol. 
10 And I need to understand what your definition of an attack is, because I think we're 
11 having --please explain your definition of that, because I --

A 
Q All right. 
--I'm doing my best to be honest and real with you, but --
Are you asking whether there was an attack on the Capitol on January 6th? 
I'm asking your definition of an attack. 
Let's go off the record at 1:25 really quickly. 
[Recess.] 
Q 
A 
Q 
A BY-
So Ms. Martin, were you in Washington, D.C. on January 6th? 
Yes, I was. 
Were you there to attend a rally held by former President Trump? 
I was there to --I was --I was happy what was going on. I was happy there 
23 was a congressional hearing that truth was being sought out. And I was there as an 
24 American backing that up. I was --I was happy for what was happening there as far as 
25 what y'all were doing, meeting up and making sure that everything went down honestly  9 
1 as far as the vote. 
2 Q So it is your understanding that Congress was there to certify a vote that was 
3 done honestly or are you saying that they were doing something else? 
4 A I was happy that Congress was having a meeting and I was there to support 
5 that meeting. 
6 Q Okay. And how did you learn that Congress would be meeting on January 
7 6th? 
8 A Um, that is a good question. I --you know what, I don't have --I can't 
9 remember how I knew about that. I just know that I heard about it. I have church at 
10 my house and I know it was brought up there. And I --and I --and I said, if God would 
11 have me go, I would go. And God opened the doors and off I went in support. 
12 Q Do you remember if you saw something on social media posted about it or 
13 someone told you about it? 
14 A You know, somebody might have told me about it, and social media might 
15 have been the same. I think it was all over the place at that time. So I can't say for 
16 sure where I originally got the information about it from. 
17 Q If I described a tweet to you by former President Trump around December 
18 19th where he talks about a gathering in Washington, D.C. on January 6th and says, be 
19 there. Will be wild! Does that ring a bell? 
20 
21 A 
Q No. 
Okay. So you mentioned that you decided to go if God would have you go. 
22 How did you come to that conclusion that you were meant to be in Washington, D.C. that 
23 day? 
24 A The same way I'm down here at the border wall with traffic kids, God 
25 provided.  10 
Meaning? 1 
2 Q 
A I'm a missionary. You know, your Bible, Jesus knocks on the door and says 
3 follow me and he provides the way and you go. That's how I knew. That's why I go 
4 where I go, is to do the Lord's work. 
5 Q And you thought that being in Washington, D.C. on January 6th involved the 
6 Lord's work? 
7 
8 
9 
10 A I was --that the whole --yeah, yep. Absolutely. 
Q And specifically --go ahead. 
A No, you go ahead. 
Q I was going to ask if you can remember specifically what part about being in 
11 D.C. was your calling to do? 
12 A Well, when I was there I met you know, a lot of we the people and they were 
13 grateful to be there. And I had heard that ANTI FA would be showing up dressed as 
14 patriots and might cause some issues. I came as a medic. 
15 I had a --I canteens, a Medipack, and a gas mask in case ANTI FA showed up and 
16 tried to turn what we the people were showing up for to support this congressional 
17 hearing and what was going on, until a problem like they had been all over the country 
18 with all the fires, attacks, and deaths. And as a medic, I was able to help people that 
19 were --were attacked by ANTI FA and make sure they were taken care of. 
20 
21 
22 
23 Q Are you a professionally trained medic? 
A I am not. 
Q So how did you come to the decision that you would be a medic on that day? 
A You know, what, I was provided with the canteens, I was provided with a 
24 Medipack, and I was provided with the gas mask. And I felt God's calling to be there and 
25 I was able to help people.  1 Q Were you provided with those things when you got to Washington, D.C. or 
2 before you went? 
3 
4 A 
Q Um, both. 
Okay. And did whoever gave you --when you say provided, does that 
5 mean someone gave them to you or you --you found them? 
6 A I was --they --they were provided to me. I was set up to be there as a 11 
7 medic. We --just like I said, we the people had showed up because we were in support 
8 of this hearing, we wanted this conversation to happen with Congress. And we 
9 were --we were there for, you know, kids are playing --kids were preaching the gospel 
10 out there, and --on the lawn, and we were sharing --sharing about God, sharing about 
11 our --our --where we've been. 
12 There --you know, there were some people that were upset. They'd been told 
13 they'd already voted when they went to go vote, but they weren't angry and I didn't see 
14 any weapons. I didn't see anybody fist fighting. I just saw people standing up and 
15 being --being Americans. 
16 I saw some ANTI FA trying to get something started and most of everybody wasn't 
17 into it. And a lot of people were excited to be there, appreciative to be at the Capitol. 
18 We --we love our country. 
19 Q So Ms. Martin, you say --you were mentioning a couple of we's there, and 
20 you said you were set up to be a medic. Were you having conversations with people 
21 about going to Washington, D.C. on January 6th, before you went? 
22 A People knew I left. I mean, I didn't just leave and not say a word. I've got 
23 family and friends. When I say we, I mean we the people. I mean the good people of 
24 America that were there. 
25 Q Right. But how do you --did you travel with anybody to Washington, D.C.?  1 
2 
3 
4 A 
Q 
A 
Q I met some friends on the plane. 
Okay. So you flew. 
Met some friends on the plane as well. 
And how are you --how are you so sure about what everybody else was 12 
5 there to do --that everyone else was --who was there shared your view of why they were 
6 in Washington, D.C.? 
7 A Everybody was pleasant and getting along. I --it was the atmosphere, it 
8 was --it was pretty awesome, you know. Just like I said, kids were running in the lawn, 
9 teenagers were sharing the gospel out of bullhorns, you had people holding crosses and 
10 praying together. We were in support of what was going on in the Capitol. So we 
11 were just praying for good --you know, it was a good atmosphere. 
12 Q 
13 listen to it? 
14 
15 
16 A 
Q 
A So on January 6th, did you attend President Trump's rally on the Ellipse or 
Nah, I missed it. I --yeah. 
What did you do instead? 
I --I patrolled the outside. I just took a walk around just --I knew 
17 that --some word --some word had went around to a few people that just like I said 
18 ANTI FA was showing up. And I had medical gear and I just wanted to make sure 
19 everything was going smooth. You know, we'd --I'd been to a few rallies where ANTI FA 
20 would show up and try to start a fight and cause an issue. And I just wanted to make 
21 sure if anything was happening that I was there to help. 
22 
23 
24 
25 Q 
A 
Q 
A Exactly where? You said outside. So outside of what were you patrolling? 
The Capitol. 
And what time --
1 walked --I walked around it. I walked around it.  1 
2 
3 
4 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
5 that was. 
6 
7 
8 Q 
A 
Q Okay. And what time were you walking around the Capitol? 
I have no idea. I think it was late morning. I wasn't looking at my clock. 
But it was --
1 know I could her Trump speaking in the background so whatever time 
And that was before there were a lot of other people there, I'm guessing? 
I don't know --oh, yeah, yeah. 
I'm just trying to get a time sense of --
9 A I mean, most everybody was at the Ellipse listening to Trump. And then a 
10 bunch of people left and then a bunch of people went up into the Capitol. And yeah, I 
11 was there. 
12 Q Got it. And how did you hear information that ANTI FA would be doing 
13 something around the Capitol? 
14 
15 
16 A 
Q 
A It was spoken about. I heard people talking. I just had my ears on so. 
By ears on, do you mean through a phone or --
And even --no, no, people --there were some people talking. I was 
17 walking around and listening and I heard some --1 heard that --that --that that was a 
18 possibility. We expected it to be a possibility. You can't have a rally or anything 
19 without them showing up trying to start something. Right? I mean, we've all figured 
20 that out by now. 13 
21 Q I was about to ask, why was it expected. Was there anything specific other 
22 than your experience or views about ANTI FA that made you think that they would show 
23 up on January 6th? 
24 A They tend to always show up. Every --everything I'd seen on the news, 
25 every bombing, every --everything I saw burning up, all the broken businesses and stuff.  14 
1 Even in my town they had a rally down there and I heard ANTI FA showed up there. And 
2 ANTIFA's, you know, showing up, they show up. They --they're --they like to start stuff, 
3 that's their fun game. That's my understanding. 
4 Q So you weren't --were you seeing this information on social media, or 
5 through Telegram chats, or Signal chats, or anything like that? 
6 
7 
8 
9 A No. I heard --I heard people speaking. 
Q And this was on the morning of January 6th that you heard people speaking? 
A Yeah, yep. 
Q Were you with a group of people? A define group of people on January 6th 
10 that you were there with? 
11 A I was around a lot of people. If there was a specific group, I don't know. 
12 There was a lot of different specific groups there. So --
13 Q Did you see people, you know, dressed up with vests on or what looked like 
14 military fatigues around you? 
15 A No, not really. I mean, I didn't see any weapons. Everybody seemed to 
16 be dressed in Trump gear mostly, and reds, whites, and blues. But, you know, probably. 
17 I just don't --I just don't recall. 
Q And did you patrol, as you said, patrol the Capitol with anybody else? 
A 19 I was on my own. 
Q 20 Okay 
22 
23 
24 
25 but --A 
Q 
A 
Q And there were other --there were other groups walking around as well, 
Were you talking to any of those groups that were patrolling the Capitol? 
I talked to a lot of people. 
Did you talk to any of those people about patrolling the Capitol?  15 
1 A Not specifically. I don't know. There is no dash --this was a while ago. 
2 mean, I --that was --I'm kind of a social butterfly, I was talking with a lot of people so --
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 Q All right. Were --did you talk to any Proud Boys that morning? 
A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Probably. 
Do you know any Proud Boys outside of January 6th? 
I'm sure I do. 
Have you ever --
Outside of January 6th? No, I didn't --no. When I went --when I went to 
9 January 6th, I'd --I'd never met a Proud Boy before. 
10 
11 
12 Q Okay. But you did meet some on January 6th? 
A 
Q Oh, I'm sure. I met a lot of people. 
Do you think you talked to any Proud Boys about patrolling the outside of 
13 the Capitol on the morning of January 6th? 
14 A I'm sure they were. Our Proud Boys are usually there to protect and keep 
15 us safe. I know that they know ANTI FA will show up and they'll --they'll battle to 
16 keep --keep the peace is what they do. 
17 
18 Q So how --if you remember, when did you stop patrolling the Capitol? 
A Let's see, everybody --I found a bathroom and everybody --a bunch of 
19 people had left the Ellipse. And then I walked to the back of the Capitol, there was 
20 people back there. And I had my flag and I went up and held my flag with them. 
21 
22 
23 Q So you didn't take part in the march to the Capitol then? 
A The march? 
Q Right. Because you weren't on the Ellipse. Were you part of the big 
24 crowd that marched up to the Capitol? 
25 A No.  16 
1 Q And during this time, when you were around the Capitol, were you using any 
2 messaging applications like Signal, Telegram, or Zella to talk to other people on January 
3 6th? 
4 
5 A 
Q Nope. 
All right. So I would have played a video for you if we got the video to work 
6 out. But you recorded a video and that was --I think you posted online and it's been 
7 archived since then. And one of the quotes that you say is, we the people, coming upon 
8 this Capitol Building demanding our rights be heard and our President be kept in office. 
9 Were you also at January 6th to support President --former President Trump? 
10 A Oh, yeah. I --I definitely support President Trump. I don't remember 
11 those being my exact words, but I do support --I did support my President Trump. 
12 Q Did you think that the people are swarming to the Capitol to help President 
13 Trump stay in office? 
14 A We were there in support of --of the hearing that was going on. We were 
15 happy the hearing was going on and we were there to support that there was a 
16 conversation and hearing to make sure that the truth, however that may be, that there 
17 was a --there was a meeting to discuss that --I'm sorry, I can't find my words here. 
18 Q That's okay. So do you --given that you were there to support the 
19 meeting, are you content with how the congressional certification came out and they 
20 certified the vote for President Biden? 
21 
22 A 
Q I don't have a reply to that. 
Well, then let me ask another way. What does support President Trump 
23 mean to you specifically on January 6th, what --what was the --how did the support 
24 look? 
25 A There was a hearing and they were discussing the vote and making sure that  17 
1 it was honestly done. 
2 Q Right. But since they had their meeting and they had an outcome that 
3 certified the vote for President Biden, is there another --
A As far as I understand they didn't finish the meeting. Did they? 4 
5 Q They --they did. They resumed it and finished it in the wee morning hours 
6 of January 7th and certified the vote for President Joe Biden. So I guess I'm just trying to 
7 figure out what you were doing in Washington, D.C. on January 6th to support President 
8 Trump? 
9 A I was supporting the President. I was supporting my country. And I was 
10 there to make sure that other people could do the same and not get hurt. And if they 
11 did, I was there to help them. 
12 
13 Q Was patrolling around the Capitol part of your support for President Trump? 
A If ANTI FA was hurting anybody, then me patrolling the Capitol would have 
14 been me using the Medi pack and the canteens on me to help somebody who was hurt. 
15 
16 
17 
18 Q Did you end up seeing anybody who got hurt? 
A Yes, I did. 
Q Do you know how they got hurt? 
A Some pepper bombs were thrown. And an elderly gentleman, his eyes 
19 were tearing up pretty bad. So I went to him and I gave him a canteen to rinse his eyes 
20 out and then brought him to a safe place. Because I was walking along, people were 
21 stopping me and holding his eyes --holding his head back and putting some more water 
22 in his eyes until I found some people to take care of him. And then I went back up the 
23 Capitol stairs and helped out another. 
24 Q Do you think that it was ANTI FA who hurt this gentleman or was it somebody 
25 else?  18 
I don't know. 1 
2 A 
Q Well, you said it was a pepper ball. Right? Did you see law enforcement 
3 shooting off tear gas or doing anything else to try to control the crowd? 
4 
5 
6 day? 
7 A 
Q 
A I didn't personally see where it came from. 
Did you think --did you see law enforcement resisting the crowd at all that 
They came up and surrounded the doors for a little bit and then they --they 
8 moved back and people went in or I don't know. I mean, the doors opened and people 
9 went in. And I did not so. 
10 Q So did you think that going into the Capitol on January 6th was a way to 
11 show support for President --for former President Trump? 
12 A When the doors opened and people walked in, I asked what was I there for. 
13 And then I seen the gentleman who was tearing up from the --his eyes were hurting and I 
14 went and I took care of him. I know some people might have went in. I have heard of 
15 some people that went in and were in awe at how beautiful the Capitol was inside. But I 
16 don't --I did not. 
17 Q Right. Not saying whether you went in or not, and it is a beautiful building. 
18 But was it your understanding that people were going into the Capitol to support 
19 President Trump? 
20 A I had no understanding of it. Just like I said, when the doors were open and 
21 people walked in, I --I --I decided --I made a decision there. I kind of asked God what 
22 he would have me do. And then I saw a gentleman that needed to be attended to. 
23 And I attended to him. 
24 Q So back from your quote from the video, you said, we the people coming 
25 upon this Capitol Building demanding our rights be heard and our President be kept in  19 
1 office. So was coming up to the Capitol part of showing your support for President 
2 Trump in some way? 
Yes. 
And why was that? 
Because he's an awesome President. 3 
4 
5 
6 A 
Q 
A 
Q Well, earlier --earlier you mentioned being in Washington, D.C. to show your 
7 support for the congressional hearing. 
8 
9 
10 
11 
12 
13 
14 
15 
16 A 
Q 
A Well, yeah, because --yeah. 
And how --
--it was about our --our president who. 
The Reporter. No overlapping, please. 
- I apologize. That was my fault. 
Go ahead, Ms. Martin. 
The Witness. Oh, that was it. Go ahead. 
BY-
Q So if were you there to support this hearing and to support President Trump, 
17 did you expect your presence right next to the Capitol to have any impact on the 
18 Members of Congress? 
19 A Yeah, yes. I think that we the people believed --I --there was 
20 a --I'm --there was --I said, I was a social butterfly, talked to quite a few who'd been told 
21 they already voted. They wanted their voices heard because they did not vote, and 
22 believed that something went wrong, and that we needed to find truth out about that. 
23 And we the people knew something had gone wrong. And we were wanting to 
24 support a hearing to bring the truth out on that matter of what had happened. 
25 Q Did you think that you needed to be right, you know, at the Capitol  1 physically in front of it to --for Congress to hear your voice? 
2 
3 
4 A 
Q 
A I don't understand what you're asking me. 
So why go to the Capitol Grounds right at the Capitol or on January 6th? 
You know, I like to think I'm right where God places me. So maybe I was 
5 placed there because that man needed some help, and the man after that, and the 20 
6 person after that. I was surrounded with --I was --I was enjoying being a part of we the 
7 people. And that I was --I was meeting some amazing people. And, you know, it's like 
8 asking me why I would stand at a certain place at a party, because there I am. 
9 But I do think that --just like pro-lifers or --or anybody else when they go 
10 somewhere together as a group they are, they are at the Capitol they are thinking, yeah. 
11 There's many of us that think something went wrong with the vote and we're standing 
12 here wanting to know what, what happened. And thank you that you all are having a 
13 meeting about this. 
14 Q You think that going into the Capitol is one way to either show support for 
15 the Members of Congress or to have your voices be heard? 
16 A You know, I think people went into the Capitol for many reasons. I think 
17 ANTIFA went in to cause trouble. I think some doors were opened and some people 
18 went in because they --they --the door was open and they walked in to check it out. 
19 I think some people were caught up and excited in the moment and didn't realize 
20 what kind of situation they were putting themselves into. I myself did not go --go into 
21 the Capitol. Like I said, I was --I was called in a different direction. 
22 Q Did you hear any of the people around you talking about going into the 
23 Capitol before they went in? 
24 
25 A 
Q No, nope. I did not. 
Did you hear anybody talking about going into the Capitol before January  1 6th? 
2 
3 A 
Q No, absolutely not. 
Did you see anything --did you see anything posted on social media about 
4 occupying the Capitol? 
5 A No. That wasn't even a thought. We were there to stand outside the 
6 Capitol and support what was going on. So no, going in was never a thought at all. 
7 
8 
9 
10 
11 Q 
A 
Q 
A 
Q Did you see people enter the Capitol? 
Yes, I did. 
And where were you when you first saw people enter the Capitol? 
I was on the back, back porch. 
Yeah. And when you saw people enter the Capitol, did you --were you 
12 proud of them? 
13 
14 A 
Q I didn't think one way or another about them. 
Okay. Because in that same video I referenced earlier you said this is so 
15 beautiful and I'm so proud to be an American right now. I love you patriots. 
16 A That was before that if anybody went into the Capitol. 
17 
18 Q 
A 
19 America. 
20 Q Okay. What does it mean to be a patriot to you in that setting? 
Standing by my constitutional rights, the fact that I'm grateful to be born in 
And you mentioned that was before --that was before you saw anyone 21 
21 enter the Capitol. So in context of the people who actually went in, would you consider 
22 them to be patriots? 
23 A Um, you know, I've already explained to you what I --my position of my 
24 understanding of anybody who went in. I think some people went in to cause trouble. 
25 I call them ANTI FA. I think some people went in because the door was open and they  22 
1 walked through it. And they were in awe. I have heard of the people going in and 
2 dropping to their knees and praying. I've seen things online of people taking selfies of 
3 themselves. I think there was a lot of reasons people went in. 
4 Q All right. 
5 A But there was no agenda that I saw, if that's what you're asking me. 
6 Q Just asking what you saw. So back to when you were walking around the 
7 Capitol. Did you see barriers erected when you were doing that? 
8 A Who? 
9 Q Barriers, like, bike racks or other things to stop people from entering the 
10 Capitol Grounds? 
A No. 11 
12 Q You didn't see any bike racks or any cops when you were walking around the 
13 Capitol? 
14 A Oh, yeah, there were some bike racks around. Sorry. I'm --this --this 
15 was a while ago, so I'm trying to --I walked around them. 
16 Q Right. And what did you take those bike racks to signify when you were 
17 walking around? 
18 
19 A That that's the place to park your bike. 
Q When there were also cops there, did you think they were barriers to stop 
20 people from going onto the Capitol Grounds? 
21 A A few cops showed up and --and were in the back. And then they 
22 dispersed and people went in. So I don't --they were there for a little bit. I walked up 
23 to them, I walked away from them. I had a harder time getting in to the front of a 
24 Metallica concert so I wasn't --I mean, they was just standing there. 
25 Q You did see people break through those barriers, though?  1 
2 
3 then? A 
Q No, I did not see a breakthrough at all. 
What you did see people --how did you see people get past the barriers 
I don't --what barriers are you talking about? 
The bike racks that had cops behind them. 23 
4 
5 
6 A 
Q 
A There were some bike racks, but they weren't barriers --you could walk right 
7 up and down the steps so I mean --there was nothing stopping anybody from going up to 
8 the back doors until some officers came and made their barrier around the back doors 
9 and then everybody stood on the other side of officers. 
10 Q But when you mentioned you were patrolling around the Capitol late 
11 morning yourself and this is before any breach of the barriers that had occurred so there 
12 were, as I think you said, you saw cops and some barriers. So I'm trying --and then you 
13 mentioned people --
14 A Oh, when I was walking around the Capitol, no. There was no --there was 
15 no police or anything around. I didn't notice any barriers, because --
16 Q I can tell you there were --and we --usually we would be able to show you 
17 the video, but there were barriers all around the Capitol Grounds up until the moment 
18 when people broke through them, which is the first one was I think a little after 12:00. 
19 So if you were walking around the Capitol in the late morning or so, you would have seen 
20 these bike racks that are connected to each other to form a fence around the Capitol 
21 Grounds. So did you see people going through those on the way to the Capitol? 
22 A I did not. 
23 Q You didn't see --
24 A I didn't go through any and I went to the back of the Capitol so I'm a little 
25 confused about this conversation.  24 
1 Q You didn't see anybody go through any barriers whatsoever to get to the 
2 Capitol? 
3 
4 A No. People just walked back to the back of the Capitol. 
Q Were you always at the back of the Capitol when people were walking up to 
5 it or were you at --
6 
7 A I walked around the whole Capitol. I --
Q All right. But when you were up near the Capitol and, you know, we were 
8 talking about what you had seen before, was that --were you only at the back of it or had 
9 you walked around to other parts of it? 
10 A After people went in, I was there for a couple hours. It got kind of quiet. 
11 walked to the front, I walked to the back. There's people milling about, just playing, 
12 picnics, whatever. And then after a couple of hours I left. 
13 Q You didn't see --did you see police officers trying to get people out of the 
14 Grounds or you know, using tear gas to disburse people? 
15 
16 
17 A No. No. 
Q Okay. Were you there were Michael Birdsong? 
A I'm not discussing any other names. If you --if you have something to ask 
18 of anybody else, please do, but I'm not discussing them. I don't feel I have that right. 
19 Q Well, you're under oath in a deposition. So we are just --I'm just asking if 
20 you were there with Mr. Birdsong. I haven't asked what he did or --
21 A I know, but I --I told you I'm not discussing other people's names. I'm 
22 happy to discuss myself and what I was doing, but not my place to say one thing or 
23 another about another person. 
24 Q So let's --why did you think you had to be in Washington, D.C. on January 
25 6th to show your support for Trump?  1 A I told God if he'd provide a way, I'd go. So God provided and I went. 
2 I --that's --
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
8 
9 Q Okay. 
Well, thank you. 
do you have any questions? 
Sure. Thank you, BY-
Q I have a couple questions, Ms. Martin. 
Thank you for your time today. I guess my first couple of questions build on 
10 what-just asked you about. The first one's pretty simple. Could you just 
11 explain again why you believe that January 6th was so important? 25 
12 A I believe something went wrong with the voting process and we were there 
13 to support that there was a meeting going on to discuss about possibilities and stand as 
14 we the people for a country that we know our vote counts, we know our rights count. 
15 Q Thank you. So you were concerned about the validity of the outcome of 
16 the election in November 2020? 
17 A Yes, I was concerned about the vote there. I was wondering if --just like I 
18 said, there seemed to have been something wrong and I was glad that our government 
19 was going to sit down together and discuss it. And I was there as we the people to back 
20 up that meeting and --yeah. 
21 Q And did you see President Trump's speech that day, his rally that day as 
22 related to the meeting that Congress was holding? 
23 A I --you know, what? I missed, I heard them talking. I heard people at the 
24 Ellipse, but I missed the whole --the whole speech so I can't say. 
25 Q Were you familiar with President Trump's claims that the election had been  26 
1 stolen from him? 
I believe something went wrong in our voting system. 2 
3 A 
Q And did you think that it was possible that the meeting on January 6th could 
4 have yielded a different outcome in the election? 
5 A I --I was --yeah. I --I guess so. That would be --
6 Q Would that --go ahead. 
7 A If the truth came out and there was proof that something went wrong with 
8 the vote that that discussion would be made. And our voting system would be, you 
9 know, just like I said. I heard people there that were frustrated, they went to go vote 
10 and were told they already voted. 
11 I'd heard a lot of frustration with people that had received five, six ballots. Some 
12 people received none. You know what I mean? There was --there was something 
13 wrong. Something was wrong. And I need to know my vote counts when I vote. 
14 So I was standing behind getting truth from there, and finding out what happened, 
15 and just like I said happy that there was a meeting discussing that. 
16 Q Got it. So what --what were you hoping would happen in that case on 
17 January 6th? 
18 A I was hoping for truth to come out and it to be truthful, to be backed up and 
19 honest, whichever way that was, and to know my vote matters. 
20 
21 Q 
A Why did you think it was so important to keep President Trump in office? 
I don't know. Are you living in our world today? He was a good 
22 President. And I believe more people voted for him than --most of the people I know 
23 who --who have voted and were told they already voted and there was an issue were 
24 Trump supporters. 
25 So it seemed to me that --that something fishy was going on and that Americans  27 
1 realized something fishy was going on. And we --we wanted there to be a discussion 
2 and find some truth there. So I was there to support truth, my vote mattering, and this 
3 country I love with other countrymen. 
4 Q Understood. And you spoke earlier about ANTI FA and some of the threats 
5 that you identified from that group. Are there other threats that you thought were 
6 particularly important for you to act against in this period leading up to January 6th and 
7 on January 6th itself? 
8 A ANTI FA is the only one really that I know comes in and takes any kind of rally 
9 and turns it into havoc and things burning and --nothing did burn, though. I didn't see 
10 any fires. But they obviously --they always show up and cause something. I --yeah. 
11 Q Thank you. I wanted to shift a little bit to ask about whether you have a 
12 relationship with Ron Watkins? 
13 
14 
15 
16 
17 A 
Q 
A 
Q 
A Once again, I --I'm not discussing other people. This is just about me. 
So is there a privilege you're asserting to --
1 just have no right to --to --
--answer my question? 
It doesn't feel right to me to discuss other people. Whether I know them 
18 or not, affiliated, or whatever, that's up to them. If you've got questions for them or 
19 anything for them, please feel free to get a hold of them and ask. 
20 Q So I'm only asking if you have a relationship with him, which is a question 
21 about you. Unfortunately, you are in a deposition, we're only able to skip over 
22 questions when there is a privilege that you've invoked that the select committee 
23 recognizes such as the Fifth Amendment as you invoked earlier. 
24 
25 So I'll ask again, do you have a relationship with Ron Watkins? 
A I'm --I'm not talking about other people. I'm not inclined to answer. Fifth  1 Amendment.

6 
7 Q 
A 
Q 
A Got it. Do you know if Ron Watkins promoted January 6th? 
I do not. 
Do you know if he was present on January 6th? 
I do not. 
I think that is all I have, if you'd like to take it back. 
- Thank you,_ I don't have any further questions at this 
8 time. So I'll pause and give anyone on the call a chance to ask questions. 
9 Hearing none, we will adjourn the deposition and hold it in recess for now. So 
10 thank you thank you very much, Ms. Martin. We're off the record.
