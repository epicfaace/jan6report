Mr. King, Lawrence Tabas 
--------------------
Attached are the Certificates (with papers for filling In vacancies), I've drafted relevant to Pennsylvania, plus a cover memo mat could 
be mailed with the Certificates . 
In terms of logiotloo, what'c key is for the electors to assemble at the appointed time. and each personally sign the six (6) c;tuplicate 
originals, make a copy of one of them (to convert to a PDF to circulate), and enclose each of them in an internal envelope, which will 
be tightly sealed, and labeled ou~~i~e somethng like: 
•ELECTORA L VOTES OF THE COMMONW EALTH OF PEN~~S\"._-.;.;:~::.. 
FOR PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATE$." 
This is the envelope that will then be opened only by the President of the Senate on January 6. 
Then, the four mailing envelopes would be acdr8S$ed with the addresses I've listed in the memo. 
Pretty simple! 
Note: the items I've listed on the memo as sent by Registered MaU need to be sent by REGISTERED (not certified) mail. Certified mail 
didn't exist in the 1940s when the relevant statute was enacted. The Bush team almost messed up on this in 20001 
I talked wilh evening with Mayor Guiliani. He understands the potential hurdle posed by the s~~':.!~~ ~~'..!!'.!~;; ~:'!. ":-.':'-'· '!-!~' :;:'"".' --:-•;~-:­
to any substitute electors, and he indicated he will make efforts to encourage all 20 Pennsylvania electors to do what they can to make 
it to the meeting. ·

~ubiA~t: PA AIAr.tor~I vot(.'."o~ -~ thr. '.'.l r: .. -.:·: .. -..-.  Hello, here are the 2 memos I just mentioned: 
Nov. 18, laying out the basic rationale for the electors voting on Dec. 14; and 
Dec. 9, with more on the logistics, including in Pennsylvania. 
Within an hour I should be finished with a draft Certificate which the 20 elt?ctnrs 
would sign, a cover memo with the addresses to which the 6 duplicate original 
Certificates would be sent, and forms for filling vacancies & alerting the Governor of 
the substitutions. 
One quick question, though: was the PA GOP required to identify the 20 electors 
previously? If not, perhaps you could simply l!~t 0n!y th0.se who cal'\ BhOlJ'' ur
