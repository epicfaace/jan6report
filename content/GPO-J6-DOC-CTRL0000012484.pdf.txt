Subject: Formal request for DCNG support on 5-6 January received 
CLASSIFICATION: UNCLASSIFIED 
The Honorable Ryan D. McCarthy, 
Secretary of the Army 
The Pentagon, Washington, D.C. 
Mr. Secretary, 
Sir, reference our conversation yesterday. Last night I received formal requests for DCNG support 
from Mayor Muriel Bowser, and Dr. Christopher Rodriguez, Director, District of Columbia Homeland 
Security and Emergency Management Agency on behalf of the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police 
Department and District of Columbia Fire and Emergency Service. 
Mr. Secretary, today additional mission analysis was conducted based on the formal requests and we 
now propose supporting the District with only 250 DCNG Guardsmen versus 350. Sir, the formal request 
letters, mission analysis and my letter were sent to Ms. Amy Luyster, Office of General Counsel this 
afternoon who confirmed she has them for action. 
Finally Sir, U.S. Secret Service senior leaders will meet on Monday and let us know then if they will 
request our support for 5 and 6 January. 
Mr. Secretary, I am standing by to answer any questions you may have between now and Monday. 
Happy New Year Sir. 
Most respectfully, 
MG Walker
