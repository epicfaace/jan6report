Hi Caroline, 
Cindy Chafian here. Alex just sent 
me your number and asked me to 
reach out about January 6, in DC. 
Are you available now to discuss? 
Sun, Dec 27, 4:44 PM 
Just spoke with Justin. He's going 
to manage the whole buildout. 
Stage, sounds, Jumbotron, etc. 
He'll get his quote to me tomorrow. 
I've reached out to a bus company 
I've worked with about rates and 
locations. I'll get that to you 
tomorrow. 
Let me know when you'd like to 
chat.

The last update I got was like three

were being finalized so I'd hold on 
sharing publicly but you're fine to 
share privately. I let the Stop the 
Steal folks know The Ellipse was 
going to be the location and they 
were very excited 
So everyone seems to be in a good

I'm trying to coordinate the program 
and I reached out to her to see if 
they would be open to moving their 
program over to the main stage 
which is what we have planned. And 
she's questioning me. 
They have area seven on the Capitol 
grounds. And their program runs 
from 10 to 12. 
She's saying that their permit is 
solid and that they aren't planning to 
move their program to the main 
stage.

Good morning! 
I didn't mean to make that my first 
text to you today. I thought I 
reached out earlier. Sorry to sound 
rude! 
Wed, Dec 30, 2:04 PM 
I think there is some 
miscommunication between you 
and Alex Jones. I am scaling back 
my program to be more in line with 
what my original contract with him 
was for. 
And so I'm clear. Will the security for 
the 6th be handled by you? I was 
under the impression that the 
expenses for the 5th would come 
from Alex Jones. And the expenses 
for the 6th would come from you. Is 
this correct? 
Ok. I need to clear some things up. 
Ali isn't working with Roger Stone. I 
am. I'm not sure what speakers Ali 
is claiming he's brought to the table 
but the list on that spreadsheet is . ,.

I will go down that morning to assist

Freedom plaza set up needs to 
begin at 6am. If you don't have a

work that I have done. I will be 
taking the fees that the Kremer's 
owe me for October as well as what

Hey there! I'd hold on printing 
anything until we decide what the 
messaging is and we have no clue 
on timing because it all depends on 
the votes that day so we won't know 
timing for a few more days. 
Regarding the budget, I need to 
connect with Justin but we don't 
have anything in our budget for the 
Freedom Plaza/Rally For Revival 
event so I told Alex if that's 
something he still wants to do with 
you then great but it would have to 
come out of his funding. 
Alternatively we could still do it and 
just use the existing stage/ 
infrastructure on The Ellipse. 
I'm in the car with my parents for 
the next couple hours but will call 
you as soon as we are off the road 
If we can do the ellipse that would 
be great. I wasn't sure if that was an 
option. So that takes that out of the 
equation. 
Last question and we can talk later. 
When can we share the location?

I am doing this because this is too

I have sent over the contracts for

The total quote that I sent for sound 
and stage was $19k. 
The tent and equipment was 
another $13k. 
Definitely NOT $50k. So I'm not 
cutting anything out from I sent. 
They can either agree to pay that or 
I'll come up with the money myself.

Hi Caroline, I just want to take a 
minute to say thank you.

Hi Cindy! I saw the ProPublica story 
and it's totally your right and 
personal choice to speak to press, 
but I'm a very private person and I'd 
really appreciate if you would refrain 
from providing reporters our private 
conversations on text message or 
email. Thank you and hope you're 
doing well! 
Hi Caroline, totally understand and 
appreciate your position. I simply 
provided context for the extent of 
my involvement with the 6th but 
moving forward, I will honor this 
request. 
And for the record, I am not the one 
who named any names as far as

And for the record, I am not the one 
who named any names as far as 
who funded anything. After I sent 
the text to Julie upon learning the 
Kremer's were involved, I didn't 
know where the money was coming 
from so I didn't speak to it. 
I am doing great and hope you are 
as well. It's unfortunate things got 
so messy. Take care.

What ever happened with that? Tim 
told me that Kylie came very 
unhinged with you that day. I felt 
badly for you because I know what 
that looks like. 
And I would like to apologize for 
yelling at you that morning. I had no 
idea what was happening and 
honestly it felt to me like you were 
working with the Kremer's behind 
my back to push Alex Jones out. I 
made a promise to him that I 
wouldn't screw him over like 
everyone else had before me. That 
was the most important thing and I 
had to stand my ground for him. It 
was nothing personal and I 
apologize for yelling and cursing the 
way I did. I never curse at people 
and I felt awful after it happened. 
So for what it's worth, I hope you 
accept my apology. ... 5GEL} 
I don't even remember you yelling at 
me that morning!?! So apology 
accepted haha

And why did they leak the donor 
name??? I mean, don't get me 
wrong, no one likes to be named in 
articles, but yours and mine are 
public info since it's on permits. The 
donor? Not cool. 
I don't get that at all. I wouldn't give 
them any names because I didn't 
want anyone to be targeted. 
Saturday 7:48 PM 
I hope the Kremer's are happy. This 
is exactly why I don't name names 
because the left is on a feeding 
frenzy right now. 
Why would they tell anyone who 
paid for it???
